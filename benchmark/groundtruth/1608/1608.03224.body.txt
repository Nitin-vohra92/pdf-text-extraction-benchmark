Introduction

Throughout this paper, all groups are finite and G always denotes a group. Moreover, n is an integer, [formula] is the set of all primes. The symbol π(n) denotes the set of all primes dividing n and π(G) = π(|G|), the set of all primes dividing the order of G. |G|p denotes the order of the Sylow p-subgroup of G.

In what follows, σ  =  {σi|i∈I} is some partition of [formula], that is, [formula] and [formula] for all i  ≠  j. Π is always supposed to be a non-empty subset of σ and [formula]. We write [formula] and σ(G) = σ(|G|).

Following [\cite=AN1] [\cite=WS1], G is said to be σ-primary if G  =  1 or |σ(G)|  =  1; n is said to be a Π-number if [formula]; a subgroup H of G is called a Π-subgroup of G if |H| is a Π-number; a subgroup H of G is called a Hall Π-subgroup of G if H is a Π-subgroup of G and |G:H| is a Π'-number. A set H of subgroups of G with 1∈H is said to be a complete Hall Π-set of G if every non-identity member of H is a Hall σi-subgroup of G for some σi∈Π and H contains exact one Hall σi-subgroup of G for every [formula]. In particular, when Π  =  σ, we call H a complete Hall σ-set of G. G is said to be Π-full if G possesses a complete Hall Π-set; a Π-full group of Sylow type if every subgroup of G is a Dσi-group for all [formula]. In particular, G is said to be σ-full (or σ-group) if G possesses a complete Hall σ-set; a σ-full group of Sylow type if every subgroup of G is a Dσi-group for all σi∈σ(G). A subgroup H of G is called [\cite=AN1] σ-subnormal in G if there is a subgroup chain [formula] such that either Hi - 1 is normal in Hi or Hi / (Hi - 1)Hi is σ-primary for all [formula].

In the past 20 years, a large number of researches have involved finding and applying some generalized complemented subgroups. For example, a subgroup H of G is said to be c-normal [\cite=WY1] in G if G has a normal subgroup T of G such that G = HT and [formula], where HG is the normal core of H. A subgroup H of G is said to be weakly s-permutable [\cite=AN3] in G if G has a subnormal subgroup T such that G = HT and [formula], where HsG is the largest s-permutable subgroup of G contained in H (note that a subgroup H of G is said to be s-permutable in G if HP = PH for any Sylow subgroup P of G). A subgroup H of G is said to be σ-permutable [\cite=AN1] in G if G possesses a complete Hall σ-set H such that HAx = AxH for all A∈H and all x∈G. By using the above special supplemented subgroups and other generalized complemented subgroups, people have obtained a series of interesting results (see [\cite=AN1] [\cite=WY1] [\cite=AN3] [\cite=AM] [\cite=AB3] [\cite=AB2] [\cite=W] [\cite=WS4] [\cite=BL] [\cite=WH] and so on). Now, we consider the following new generalized supplemented subgroup:

A subgroup H of G is said to be weakly σ-permutable in G if there exists a σ-subnormal subgroup T of G such that G = HT and [formula], where HσG is the subgroup of H generated by all those subgroups of H which are σ-permutable in G.

Following [\cite=AN2], HσG is called σ-core of H.

It is clear that every c-normal subgroup, every s-permutable subgroup, every weakly s-permutable subgroup and every σ-permutable subgroup of G are all weakly σ-permutable in G. However, the following example shows that the converse is not true.

Let [formula], where [formula] is a non-abelian group of order 21 and A5 is the alternating group of degree 5. Let B be a subgroup of A5 of order 12 and A be a Sylow 5-subgroup of A5. Let σ  =  {σ1,σ2}, where σ1  =  {2,3,5} and σ2  =  {2,3,5}'. Then B is weakly σ-permutable in G. In fact, let [formula], then [formula] and [formula] is a σ1-number. Hence G / TG is a σ1-group, and so T is σ-subnormal in G. Since [formula] and G = BT, which means that B is weakly σ-permutable in G. But B is neither weakly s-permutable in G nor c-normal in G. In fact, if there exists a subnormal subgroup K of G such that G = BK and [formula]. Then BsG is subnormal in G by [\cite=AN3], and so is subnormal in A5 by [\cite=Doerk] . It follows that BsG = 1 for A5 is a simple group. Hence |G:K| = |B| = 22  ·  3. But since 1 < A5 < A5C7 < G is a chief series of G and also a composition series of G, G has no subnormal subgroup K whose index is 22  ·  3 by Jordan-H[formula]lder theorem. Therefore B is not weakly s-permutable in G. Consequently, B is neither s-permutable nor c-normal in G.

Now let H = BC3. Then H is weakly σ-permutable in G but not σ-permutable in G, Indeed, let T = C7A5. Then G = HT, T is normal in G and [formula]. It is easy to see that H  =  {A5C3,C7} is a complete Hall σ-set of G. Since HσG is σ-subnormal in G by Lemma [\ref=permutable] (4) below and [\cite=AN1], HσG  ≤  Oσ1(G) by Lemma [\ref=subnormal](8) below. Clearly, Oσ1(G)  ≤  CG(Oσ2(G)) = CG(C7) = C7A5. Hence HσG  ≤  C7A5. But since B(A5C3)x = BA5Cx3 = A5Cx3 = Cx3A5 = (A5C3)xB for all x∈G, B is σ-permutable in G for [formula]. Hence B  ≤  HσG  ≤  C7A5, which implies that B = HσG. So H is weakly σ-permutable in G, But H is not σ-permutable in G for HσG = B < H.

Following [\cite=AN1], G is called: (i) σ-soluble if every chief factor of G is σ-primary; (ii) σ-nilpotent if [formula] is σ-primary for every chief factor H / K of G.

The result in [\cite=AN1] [\cite=AN3] [\cite=WS2] [\cite=SS] [\cite=WY1] are the motivation for the following:

Let G be a σ-full group of Sylow type. What is the structure of G provided that some subgroups are weakly σ-permutable in G?

In this paper, we obtain the following results.

Let G be a σ-full group of Sylow type and every Hall σi-subgroup of G is weakly σ-permutable in G for every σi∈σ(G). Then G is σ-soluble.

Let G be a σ-full group of Sylow type and [formula] be a complete Hall σ-set of G such that Wi is a nilpotent σi-subgroup for all [formula]. Suppose that the maximal subgroups of any non-cyclic Wi is weakly σ-permutable in G. Then G is supersoluble.

The following results now follow immediately from Theorems [\ref=Th1] and [\ref=Th3].

If every sylow subgroup is weakly s-permutable in G, then G is soluble.

(See Huppert [\cite=HU]) If every Sylow subgroup of G is cyclic, then G is supersoluble .

(See Miao [\cite=LM]) If all maximal subgroups of every Sylow subgroup of G are weakly s-permutable in G, then G is supersoluble.

(See Skiba [\cite=AN3]) If all maximal subgroups of every non-cyclic Sylow subgroup of G are weakly s-permutable in G, then G is supersoluble.

(See Srinivasan [\cite=SS]) If all maximal subgroups of every Sylow subgroup of G are normal in G, then G is supersoluble.

(See Srinivasan [\cite=SS]) If all maximal subgroups of every Sylow subgroup of G are s-permutable in G, then G is supersoluble.

(See Wang [\cite=WY1]) If all maximal subgroups of every Sylow subgroup of G are c-normal in G, then G is supersoluble.

Recall that a normal subgroup E of G is called hypercyclically embedded in G and is denoted by [formula] (see [\cite=SR]) if either E = 1 or [formula] and every chief factor of G below E is cyclic, where the symbol [formula] is the [formula]-hypercentre of G, that is, the product of all normal hypercyclically embedded subgroups of G. Hypercyclically embedded subgroups play an important role in the theory of groups (see [\cite=AB2] [\cite=W] [\cite=SR] [\cite=MW] ) and the conditions under which a normal subgroup is hypercyclically embedded in G were found by many authors (see the books [\cite=AB2] [\cite=W] [\cite=SR] [\cite=MW] and the recent papers [\cite=BL] [\cite=WS2] [\cite=AN4] [\cite=AN5] [\cite=LS] [\cite=WST] ).

On the base of Theorem [\ref=Th3], we will prove the following result.

Let G be a σ-full group of Sylow type and [formula] be a complete Hall σ-set of G such that Wi is nilpotent for all [formula]. Let E be a normal subgroup of G. If every maximal subgroup of [formula] is weakly σ-permutable in G for all [formula], then [formula].

The following results directly follow from Theorem [\ref=Th4].

Let [formula] be a saturated formation containing all supersoluble groups and let E be a normal subgroup of G with [formula]. Suppose that G is a σ-full group of Sylow type and [formula] is a complete Hall σ-set of G such that Wi is nilpotent for all [formula]. If every maximal subgroup of [formula] is weakly σ-permutable in G, for all [formula], then [formula].

(See Asaad [\cite=AM2]) Let G be a group with a normal subgroup E such that G / E is supersoluble. If every maximal subgroup of every Sylow subgroups of E is s-permutable in G, then G is supersoluble.

(See Asaad [\cite=AM3]) Let [formula] be a saturated formation containing all supersoluble groups and let E be a normal subgroup of G with [formula]. If the maximal subgroups of every Sylow subgroup of E are s-permutable in G, then [formula].

(See Wei [\cite=WH]) Let [formula] be a saturated formation containing all supersoluble groups and let E be a normal subgroup of G with [formula]. If the maximal subgroups of every Sylow subgroup of E are c-normal in G, then [formula].

All unexplained terminologies and notations are standard, as in [\cite=W] and [\cite=Doerk].

Preliminaries

We use [formula] and [formula] to denote the classes of all σ-soluble groups and σ-nilpotent groups.

(See [\cite=AN1] The class [formula] is closed under taking direct products, homomorphic images and subgroups. Moreover, any extension of the σ-soluble group by a σ-soluble group is a σ-soluble group as well.

Following [\cite=AN1] and [\cite=WS1], OΠ(G) to denote the subgroup of G generated by all its Π'-subgroups. Instead of O{σi}(G) we write Oσi(G). OΠ(G) to denote the subgroup of G generated by all its normal Π-subgroups.

(See [\cite=AN1] and [\cite=WS1]) Let A,K and N be subgroups of G. Suppose that A is σ-subnormal in G and N is normal in G.

(1) [formula] is σ-subnormal in K.

(2) If K is a σ-subnormal subgroup of A, then K is σ-subnormal in G.

(3) If K is σ-subnormal in G, then [formula] and 〈A,K〉 are σ-subnormal in G.

(4) AN / N is σ-subnormal in G / N.

(5) If N  ≤  K and K / N is σ-subnormal in G / N, then K is σ-subnormal in G.

(6) If K  ≤  A and A is σ-nilpotent, then K is σ-subnormal in G.

(7) If |G:A| is a Π-number, then OΠ(A) = OΠ(G).

(8) If G is Π-full and A is a Π-group, then A  ≤  OΠ(G).

Let L be some non-empty set of subgroups of G and E a subgroup of G. Then a subgroup A of G is called L-permutable if AH = HA for all H∈L; LE-permutable if AHx = HxA for all H∈L and all x∈E. In particular, a subgroup H of G is σ-permutable if G possesses a complete Hall σ-set H such that H is HG-permutable.

(See [\cite=AN1] and [\cite=WS1]) Let H,K and N be subgroups of G. Let [formula] be a complete Hall σ-set of G and L  =  HK. Suppose that H is L-permutable and N is normal in G.

(1) If H  ≤  E  ≤  G, then H is [formula]-permutable, where [formula]. In particular, if G is a σ-full group of Sylow type and H is σ-permutable in G, then H is σ-permutable in E.

(2) The subgroup HN / N is [formula]-permutable, where [formula].

(3) If G is a σ-full group of Sylow type and E / N is a σ-permutable subgroup of G / N, then E is σ-permutable in G.

(4) If K is L-permutable, then 〈H,K〉 is L-permutable [\cite=Doerk]. In particular, HσG is σ-permutable in G. Moreover, if G is a σ-full group of Sylow type, then HσG is a σ-subnormal of G(see [\cite=AN1]).

(See [\cite=AN1]) Let H be a σ1-subgroup of a σ-full group G. Then H is σ-permutable in G if and only if Oσ1(G)  ≤  NG(H).

Let G be a σ-full group of Sylow type and H  ≤  K  ≤  G.

(1) If H is weakly σ-permutable in G, then H is weakly σ-permutable in K.

(2) Suppose that N is a normal subgroup of G and N  ≤  H. Then H / N is weakly σ-permutable in G / N if and only if H is weakly σ-permutable in G.

(3) If N is a normal subgroup of G, then for every weakly σ-permutable subgroup H of G with (|H|,|N|) = 1, HN / N is weakly σ-permutable in G / N.

(1) Suppose that there exists a σ-subnormal subgroup T of G such that G = HT and [formula]. Since H  ≤  K, [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=subnormal] (1), [formula] is σ-subnormal in K. Moreover, [formula] by Lemma [\ref=permutable] (1)(4). Hence, H is weakly σ-permutable in K.

(2) First assume that there exists a σ-subnormal subgroup T of G such that G = HT and [formula]. Then G / N = (H / N)(TN / N), TN / N is σ-subnormal in G / N by Lemma [\ref=subnormal] (4) and [formula] by Lemma [\ref=permutable] (2). This shows that H / N is weakly σ-permutable in G / N.

Conversely, assume that H / N is weakly σ-permutable in G / N. Then G / N = (H / N)(T / N) and [formula], where T / N is σ-subnormal in G / N. So G = HT and T is σ-subnormal in G by Lemma [\ref=subnormal] (5). Let (H / N)σ(G / N) = E / N. Then E is σ-permutable in G by Lemma [\ref=permutable] (3)(4). Hence [formula]. This shows that H is weakly σ-permutable in G.

(3) Assume that there exists a σ-subnormal subgroup T of G such that G = HT and [formula]. Then G / N = (HN / N)(TN / N). Since (|H|,|N|) = 1, [formula]. Hence [formula] by [\cite=Doerk]. It follows that N  ≤  T. Hence [formula] by Lemma [\ref=permutable] (2)(4). Besides, by Lemma [\ref=subnormal] (4), T / N is σ-subnormal in G / N. Thus HN / N is weakly σ-permutable in G / N.

(See [\cite=CGA]) Let P be a normal p-subgroup of a group G . If P / Φ(P)  ≤  ZU(G / Φ(P)), then P  ≤  ZU(G).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Th1]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Th1]. Assume that this is false and let G be a counterexample of minimal order. Then |σ(G)| > 1.

(1) G / N is σ-soluble, for every non-identity normal subgroup N of G.

Let N be a non-identity normal subgroup of G and H / N is any Hall σi-subgroup of G / N, where [formula]. Then H / N  =  HiN / N for some Hall σi-subgroup Hi of G. By the hypothesis, there exists a σ-subnormal subgroup T of G such that G = HiT and [formula]. Then G / N = (HiN / N)(TN / N) = (H / N)(TN / N). Since [formula] is a σi'-number, [formula]. Hence [formula] by [\cite=Doerk]. Consequently, [formula] by Lemma [\ref=permutable] (2)(4). By Lemma [\ref=subnormal] (4), TN / N is σ-subnormal in G / N. Therefore H / N is weakly σ-permutable in G / N. This shows that G / N satisfies the hypothesis. The minimal choice of G implies that G / N is σ-soluble.

(2) G is not a simple group.

Suppose that G is a non-abelian simple group. Then 1 is the only proper σ-subnormal subgroup of G. Let Hi be a non-identity Hall σi-subgroup of G, where σi∈σ(G). By the hypothesis and |σ(G)| > 1, we have G = HiG and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=permutable] (4), (Hi)σG is σ-subnormal in G, so Hi = (Hi)σG = 1, a contradiction. So we have (2).

(3) Let R be a minimal normal subgroup of G, then R is σ-soluble.

Let H be any Hall σi-subgroup of R, where [formula]. Then there exists a Hall σi-subgroup Hi of G such that [formula]. By the hypothesis, there exists a σ-subnormal subgroup T of G such that G = HiT and [formula]. Since [formula] is a σ'i-number, [formula]. Hence, [formula] by [\cite=Doerk]. Since [formula] is σ-subnormal in R by Lemma [\ref=subnormal] (1) and [formula] by Lemma [\ref=permutable] (1)(4), R satisfies the hypothesis. The minimal choice of G implies that R is σ-soluble.

(4) Final contradiction.

In veiw of (1), (2) and (3), we have that G is σ-soluble by Lemma [\ref=soluble]. The final contradiction completes the proof of the theorem.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Th3]

First we prove the following proposition, which is a main step of the proof of Theorem [\ref=Th3].

Let G be a σ-full group of Sylow type and [formula] be a complete Hall σ-set of G such that Wi is a nilpotent σi-subgroup for all [formula], and let the smallest prime p of π(G) belongs to σ1. If every maximal subgroup of W1 is weakly σ-permutable in G, then G is soluble.

First note that if G is σ-soluble, then every chief factor H / K of G is σ-primary, that is, H / K is a σi-group for some i. But since Wi is nilpotent, H / K is a elementary abelian group. It follows that G is soluble. Hence we only need to prove that G is σ-soluble. Suppose that the assertion is false, and let G be a counterexample of minimal order. Then clearly t  >  1, and p = 2∈π(W1) by the well-known Feit-Thompson's theorem. Without loss of generality, we can assume that Wi is a σi-group for all [formula].

(1) Oσ1(G) = 1.

Assume that [formula]. Note that if W1 = N, then G / N is a σ1'-group, so G / N is soluble by the well-known Feit-Thompson's theorem and so G is σ-soluble. We may, therefore, assume that W1  ≠  N. Then W1 / N is a non-identity Hall σ1-subgroup of G / N. Let M / N be a maximal subgroup of W1 / N. Then M is a maximal subgroup of W1. By the hypothesis and Lemma [\ref=main] (2), M / N is weakly σ-permutable in G / N. The minimal choice of G implies that G / N is σ-soluble. Consequently, G is σ-soluble. This contradiction shows that (1) holds.

(2) Oσ1'(G) = 1.

Assume that [formula]. Then W1R / R is a Hall σ1-subgroup of G / R. Let M / R be a maximal subgroup of W1R / R. Then [formula]. Since W1 is nilpotent and [formula], [formula] is a maximal subgroup of W1. By the hypothesis and Lemma [\ref=main] (3), [formula] is weakly σ-permutable in G / R. This shows that G / R satisfies the hypothesis. The choice of G implies that G / R is σ-soluble. By the well-known Feit-Thompson's theorem, we know that R is soluble. It follows that G is σ-soluble, a contradiction.

(3) If [formula] is a minimal normal subgroup of G, then R is not σ-soluble and G = RW1.

If R is σ-soluble, then R is a σi-group for some σi∈σ(G). So R  ≤  Oσ1(G) or R  ≤  Oσ'1(G), a contradiction. Therefore, R is not σ-soluble. Assume that RW1 < G. Then by the hypothesis and Lemma [\ref=main] (1), RW1 satisfies the hypothesis. Hence RW1 is σ-soluble by the choice of G. It follows from Lemma [\ref=soluble] that R is σ-soluble. This contradiction shows that G = RW1.

(4) G has a unique minimal normal subgroup R.

By (3), G = RW1 for every non-identity minimal normal subgroup R of G. Then clearly, G / R is σ-soluble. Hence by Lemma [\ref=soluble] G has a unique minimal normal subgroup, which is denoted by R.

(5) W1 is a 2-group.

Let [formula]. As W1 is nilpotent, there exists two maximal subgroups M1 and M2 of W1 such that |W1:M1| = q and |W1:M2| = 2. By the hypothesis, there exists σ-subnormal subgroups Ti of G, such that G = MiTi and [formula], i = 1,2. By Lemma [\ref=permutable] (4), (Mi)σG is σ-subnormal in G. Then by Lemma [\ref=subnormal] (8), (Mi)σG  ≤  Oσ1(G) = 1, i = 1,2. Hence [formula]. Consequently, [formula], i = 1,2, which implies that |G:Ti| is a σ1-number for i = 1,2. Hence Oσ1(Ti) = Oσ1(G) for i = 1,2 by Lemma [\ref=subnormal] (7). Since t  >  1, Oσ1(G) > 1. It follows that 1  ≠  Oσ1(G)  ≤  (Ti)G for i = 1,2. Then by (4), [formula]. It is clear that [formula] is a Hall σ1-subgroup of R, and [formula] by (2). So [formula]. Since G = M1T1 = W1T1 = M2T2 = W1T2, where [formula] and [formula], we have that [formula] and [formula]. Therefore [formula], which implies that [formula]. This contradiction shows that W1 is a 2-group.

(6) Final contradiction.

Let P1 be a maximal subgroup of W1. Then |W1:P1| = 2. By the hypothesis, there exists a σ-subnormal subgroup K of G such that G = P1K and [formula]. By (1) and Lemma [\ref=subnormal] (8), (P1)σG = 1, Hence |K|2 = 2, and so K is 2-nilpotent by [\cite=HU]. Let K2' be the normal Hall 2'-subgroup of K. Then 1  ≠  K2' is σ-subnormal in G, and so K2'  ≤  Oσ'1(G) = 1 by Lemma [\ref=subnormal](8). The finial contradiction completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Th3]. Assume that the assertion is false, and let G be a counterexample of minimal order.

(1) G is soluble.

Let q is the smallest prime dividing |G|. Without loss of generality, we may assume that q∈π(W1). If W1 is cyclic, then the Sylow q-subgroup of G is cyclic. Hence G is q-nilpotent by [\cite=HU] and so G is soluble. If W1 is non-cyclic, then by Proposition [\ref=prop1], G is soluble. Hence we always have that G is soluble.

(2) The hypothesis holds on G / R for every non-identity minimal normal subgroup R of G. Consequently G / R is supersoluble.

It is clear that [formula] is a complete Hall σ-set of G / R and [formula] is nilpotent. By (1), R is an elementary abelian p-group for some prime p. Without loss of generality, we can assume that R  ≤  W1. If W1 / R is non-cyclic, then W1 is non-cyclic. For every maximal subgroup M / R of W1 / R, we have that M is a maximal subgroup of W1. Then by the hypothesis and Lemma [\ref=main] (2), M / R is weakly σ-permutable in G / R. Now assume that WiR / R is non-cyclic for [formula] and M / R be a maximal subgroup of WiR / R. Then [formula]. As Wi is nilpotent, [formula] is a prime. Hence [formula] is a maximal subgroup of Wi. By the hypothesis and Lemma [\ref=main] (3), [formula] is weakly σ-permutable in G / R. This shows that the hypothesis holds for G / R. Hence G / R is supersoluble by the choice of G.

(3) R is the unique minimal normal subgroup of G, Φ(G) = 1, CG(R) = R = F(G) = Op(G) and |R| > p for some prime p (It follows from (2)).

(4) For some [formula], Wi is a p-group. Without loss of generality, we may assume that W1 is a p-group.

Since R is a p-group, R  ≤  Wi for some [formula]. Moreover, since CG(R) = R and Wi is a nilpotent group, we have that Wi is a p-group.

(5) Final contradiction.

Since Φ(G) = 1, [formula] [\cite=HU]. Hence there exists a maximal subgroup V of W1 such that W1 = RV. Let [formula]. Then |R:E| = |RV:V| = |W1:V| = p. Hence E is a maximal subgroup of R and [formula]. Since |R| > p and R  ≤  W1, W1 is non-cyclic. Hence by the hypothesis, there exists a σ-subnormal subgroup T of G such that G = VT and [formula]. Since |G:T| is p-number, Op(T)  =  Oσ1(T) = Oσ1(G) by Lemma [\ref=subnormal] (7). So |G:TG| is p-number. It follows that [formula] and R  ≤  TG  ≤  T by (2). Since VσG is σ-subnormal in G by Lemma [\ref=permutable] (4), we have that VσG  ≤  Oσ1(G) = Op(G) = R by Lemma [\ref=subnormal] (8). Hence [formula]. But since E is a maximal subgroup of R, it follows that VσG = R or VσG = E. In the former case, we have that R  ≤  V, a contradiction. In the later case, E = VσG is σ-permutable in G by Lemma [\ref=permutable] (4) and E is a σ1-group. It follows from Lemma [\ref=normalizes] that Oσ1(G)  ≤  NG(E). Hence [formula], which contradicts the minimality of R. The final contradiction completes the proof of the theorem.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Th4]

Assume that the assertion is false and let (G,E) be a counterexample with |G| + |E| minimal. Without loss of generality, we can assume that Wi is a σi-group for all [formula]. We now proceed with the proof via the following steps.

(1) E is supersoluble.

In fact, [formula] is a complete Hall σ-set of E and [formula] is nilpotent. Consequently, E is a σ-full group of Sylow type. By Lemma [\ref=main] (1) and Theorem [\ref=Th3]. Hence E is supersoluble.

(2) If R is a minimal normal subgroup of G contained in E, then R is a p-group for some prime p and the hypothesis holds for (G / R,E / R). Therefore [formula].

By (1), R is a p-group for some p. Without loss of generality, we can assume that [formula]. It is clear that [formula] is a complete Hall σ-set of G / R and [formula] is nilpotent. Let M / R be a maximal subgroup of [formula]. Then by the hypothesis and Lemma [\ref=main] (2), M / R is weakly σ-permutable in G / R. Now let V / R be a maximal subgroup of [formula], [formula]. Then [formula]. Since [formula] is nilpotent, [formula] is a prime, so [formula] is a maximal subgroup of [formula]. Then by the hypothesis and Lemma [\ref=main] (3), [formula] is weakly σ-permutable in G / R, [formula]. This shows that (G / R,E / R) satisfies the hypothesis. Thus [formula] by the choice of (G,E).

(3) R is the unique minimal normal subgroup of G contained in E, |R| > p and Op'(E) = 1.

Let L be a minimal normal subgroup of G contained in E such that R  ≠  L. Then [formula] and [formula] by (2), and clearly, |R| > p. It follows that [formula], so |R| = p by the G-isomorphism RL / L≃R, a contradiction. Hence R is the unique minimal normal subgroup of G contained in E. Consequently, Op'(E) = 1. Hence (3) holds.

Without loss of generality, we may assume p∈π(W1).

(4) E is a p-group and so [formula] and [formula] for [formula].

Let q be the largest prime dividing |E| and let Q be a Sylow q-subgroup of E. Since E is supersoluble by (1) (see [\cite=HU]), Q is characteristic in E. Then Q is normal in G. Hence by (3) we have that q = p and F(E) = Q = Op(E) = P is a Sylow p-subgroup of E. Thus CE(P)  ≤  P (see [\cite=W1]). But since [formula] and [formula] is nilpotent, we have that [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula] for all [formula], the hypothesis holds for (G,P). If P < E, then [formula] by the choice of (G,E). It follows that |R| = p, a contradiction. Hence E = P is a p-group, and so E  ≤  W1.

(5) Φ(E) = 1, so E is elementary abelian p-group.

Assume that Φ(E)  ≠  1. Then clearly, (G / Φ(E),E / Φ(E)) satisfies the hypothesis. Hence [formula]. It follows from (4) and Lemma [\ref=XC] that [formula], a contradiction. Thus we have (5).

(6) Final contradiction.

Let R1 be a maximal subgroup of R such that [formula]. Then |R1|  >  1 by (3). Claim (5) implies that R has a complement S in E. Let V = R1S. Then [formula] and V is a maximal subgroup of E. Hence by (4) and the hypothesis, there exists a σ-subnormal subgroup T of G such that G = VT and [formula]. Then G = VT = ET and [formula]. By (5), it is easy to see that [formula]. Hence [formula] by (3), and so [formula]. Consequently, [formula]. It follows that [formula] or [formula]. In the former case, R  ≤  V, which contradicts the fact that [formula]. Thus [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=permutable](4), we have that VσG is σ-permutable in G, so Oσ1(G)  ≤  NG(VσG) by Lemma [\ref=normalizes]. Hence [formula]. Moreover, since [formula], we obtain that [formula]. This implies that R1 = 1. The final contradiction completes the proof.
