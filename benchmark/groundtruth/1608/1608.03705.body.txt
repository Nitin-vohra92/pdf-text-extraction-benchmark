Near and Far from Equilibrium Power-Law Statistics

In this paper we approach the hadronization problem in high energy physics from statistical viewpoint. In a balanced version of decay and growth processes a simple master equation arrives at a final state including the Poisson, Bernoulli, negative binomial and Pólya distribution [\cite=BiroNeda]. Such decay and growth rates incorporate a symmetry between the observed subsystem and the rest of a total system as a rule. For particle physics problems Pn is the probability of having n particles (or other quanta). In an avalanche type process the simplest assumptions about elementary rates in the master equation result in the exponential distribution with constant rates and in the power-law tailed Waring [\cite=WARING] distribution with linear preference rates. In this short paper we review relevant random filling patterns in phase space and treat thermal parameters as averages. We present master equations classified for describing dynamical stochastic processes near and far from equilibrium, and in particular analyze stationary distributions for large n. In this limit a set of coupled ordinary differential equations is replaced by a partial differential equation.

Following Einstein, we assume that the available phase-space volume at a given total energy, E, is filled evenly in statistical equilibrium or in a stationary state. Then the blind chance to find a part of the phase space, a.o. a single particle with energy ω  ≈  mT - m, will be given by Ω(ω)Ω(E - ω) / Ω(E). Beyond the one-particle phase space factor, Ω(ω), the rest occurs as an environmental weight factor

[formula]

In the simplest, idealized case the phase space volume is just a hypersphere with radius E, in dimension n: [formula]. The above weight factor for picking out a single particle with energy ω becomes:

[formula]

The often cited thermodynamical limit then leads to a Boltzmann-Gibbs factor

[formula]

interpreting the kinetic temperature as T = E / n.

However, experimentally studied physical systems are often far from the thermodynamical limit. In small systems fluctuations can be large, and an averaging over several millions of events is done for the histogram bins in obtaining pT spectra. In thermal models ω is a monotonic rising function of pT. Such an average of the above ratio,

[formula]

is interesting to be inspected for famous n-distributions. For the Poisson we obtain

[formula]

and for the negative binomial distribution (NBD)

[formula]

For a general event distribution we expand eq.([\ref=AVERp]) for ω  ≪  E and compare the result with the Tsallis-Pareto distribution

[formula]

Expanding both expressions ([\ref=AVERp],[\ref=TSALLISp]) up to terms quadratic in ω we obtain

[formula]

The parameter T is the event-averaged kinetic temperature, while (q - 1) is a measure of the non-Poissonity in the multiplicity distribution. These findings can easily be generalized by comparing the environmental factor ([\ref=WEIGHTFACTOR]) with the Tsallis - Pareto distribution ([\ref=TSALLISp]):

[formula]

Expanding in ω  ≪  E both sides up to quadratic terms we obtain

[formula]

This interprets the parameter T as the inverse of the average [formula] and (q - 1) as the non-Gaussianity in β fluctuation. For q = 1 the variance Δβ would be [formula] [\cite=BIRO]. Here [formula].

We discuss the following schemes of master equations. The diffusion class describes near equilibrium stochastic evolution of the probability, Pn, with the growth rate form n to n + 1, μn and the decay rate to n - 1, λn:

[formula]

The avalanche class describes a contesting race eventually achieving stationary branching ratios:

[formula]

Here the decay rate, γn, describes exit from the chain, a reduction in n is not assumed. Fig.[\ref=fig1] depicts the difference between these classes. By studying the stationary branching in the avalanche type dynamics, we are especially interested in the mean aging model, where for [formula] and therefore [formula]. In the stationary limit: Pn(t)  →  Qn, and from [formula] one obtains

[formula]

Now, constant growth rates, μj  =  σ lead to the exponential distribution

[formula]

Linear preference growth rates   μj  =  σ(j + b)   (b > 0) lead to the Waring distribution [\cite=WARING] [\cite=NETWORKWARING] [\cite=SCHUBERT],

[formula]

This distribution has a power-law tail for large n as ~  n- 1 - γ  /  σ. For negligible decay compared to the growth, γ  ≪  σ, one arrives at the Zipf distribution. It is interesting to note that it has been suggested by Osada et.al. [\cite=Japanese1997] that the special dynamics with γn  =  σ(n - kf) and μn  =  σf(n + k) leads exactly to the NBD as stationary distribution,

[formula]

We note that for large n the avalanche dynamics effectively uses the variable x = nΔx and solves [formula]. The stationary distribution is

[formula]

In this framework the constant rate μ(x) = σ leads to the exponential, and the linear rate, μ(x) = σ(x + b) to the Tsallis-Pareto stationary distribution [\cite=PARETO]

[formula]

A connection between pT and n distributions is hinted at in finding different q values for different participant numbers in experiments [\cite=ALICE] [\cite=PHENIX] [\cite=PHENIXsurvey2005]. Our model form eqs.([\ref=TqINTERPRET],[\ref=TqINTERPRET2]) predicts T = E(δ2 - (q - 1)) with E  =  CT  ≈  1.4 GeV and [formula]. Fig.[\ref=Fig3] shows our fit results to the LHC ALICE PbPb data at 2.76 TeV. Darker points belong to more central collisions. We also distinguish between soft (pT  <  5 GeV, red data points) and hard (pT  >  3 GeV, blue data points) spectral parts. For fit parameters and further details see legend. The green stars are data from pp collision [\cite=WILK], lying on a T = E(q - 1) line with E  ≈  1 GeV. The AA points seem to favor δ2 = 0.25 independent of [formula], while the pp points [formula], meaning a constant [formula] value in the NBD distribution.
