A Magnetar-like Outburst from a High-B Radio Pulsar

Introduction

PSR J1119-  6127 is a radio pulsar having spin period P = 0.407 s, discovered in the Parkes multibeam 1.4-GHz survey [\citep=ckl+00]. The pulsar's P and spin-down rate [formula] imply a characteristic age τ  <  2 kyr, making this object one of the youngest pulsars in the Galaxy, consistent with an association with the supernova remnant G292.2-  0.5 [\citep=cgk+01] at a distance of 8.4 kpc [\citep=cmc04]. Those same spin parameters, under the assumption of vacuum dipole spin-down, imply a dipolar surface magnetic field B  =  4.1  ×  1013 G, among the highest known among radio pulsars. The pulsar's spin-down luminosity is [formula] erg s- 1.

Past X-ray observations of the source [\citep=gs03b] [\citep=sk08] [\citep=nkh+12] have shown it to be a soft X-ray pulsar, with strong pulsations below 2.5 keV, and none seen above this energy. This emission was well described by a two-component model consisting of a power law of index ~  2.1, with a hot thermal component of blackbody temperature kT≃0.2 keV, high compared to lower-field radio pulsars of comparable age [\citep=km05] [\citep=zkm+11] [\citep=ozv+13]. Radio pulse profile changes, short radio bursts and unusual timing recoveries were observed near epochs of glitches in this source [\citep=wje11] [\citep=awe+15], reminiscent of radio radiative behavior [\citep=crh+06] and glitch recoveries [\citep=dk14] following magnetar outbursts. The pulsar is also among the highest-B sources to have been detected in γ-rays by Fermi [\citep=pkh+11].

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) both reported short magnetar-like bursts from PSR J1119-  6127, on 2016 July 27 [\citep=ykr16] and 2016 July 28 [\citep=klm+16], respectively. Immediately following the BAT burst, the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) found a bright X-ray source at the position of PSR J1119-  6127 [\citep=klm+16] with pulsations at the rotational period [\citep=ave16]. This suggests that this radio pulsar has had a magnetar-like outburst, similar to the 2006 transition of rotation-powered, but radio-quiet, pulsar PSR J1846-  0258 [\citep=ggg+08]. Interestingly, the radio pulsations from PSR J1119-6127 have disappeared [\citep=bpk+16].

We report here on our Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) X-ray observations of PSR J1119-  6127 with the Swift/XRT and NuSTAR during the first few days of the transition, as well as on pre-outburst Fermi/LAT timing data.

Observations & Analysis

Swift-XRT & NuSTAR Observations

The Swift-XRT [\citep=bhn+05] slewed to observe PSR J1119-6127 62.8 s after the BAT trigger [\citep=klm+16]. XRT was operated in Photon Counting (PC) mode for this 2.2-ks observation (ObsID 00706396000, spanning 2016 July 28 01:28 - 02:07 UT), and in Windowed-Timing (WT) mode for the follow-up observations (ObsID 00034632001/2), spanning July 28 17:20 to July 29 03:11 UT and July 31 04:20 to August 1 20:37 UT for exposures of 9.9 and 4.8 ks, respectively.

As the time resolution of PC mode is 2.5 s (longer than the period of the pulsar), only WT mode observations, with a time resolution of 1.76  ms, were used in the timing analysis.

NuSTAR [\citep=hcc+13] began ToO observations of PSR J1119-6127 at 2016 July 28, 23:05:12 UT yielding a total exposure time of 54.5 ks (ObsID 80102048002) partially overlapping with XRT observation 00034632001. The data from the two focal plane modules of NuSTAR are referred to hereafter as FPMA and FPMB.

The Swift-XRT and NuSTAR data were processed with the standard xrtpipeline and nupipeline scripts, respectively, using HEASOFT v6.17 and time corrected to the Solar System barycenter from the Chandra location of PSR J1119-6127 [\citep=gs03b].

For Swift, we selected only Grade 0 events for spectral fitting as other event grades are more likely to be caused by background events [\citep=bhn+05]. Swift spectra were extracted from the selected regions using extractor. Source photons were extracted from a 10-pixel radius circular region centered on PSR J1119-6127 with an annular background region with an inner and outer radius of 75 and 125 pixels, respectively.

The WT observations had multiple soft X-ray bursts which appear in both the source and background regions that, from past experience, seem to be instrumental in origin. Hence, for the WT mode data, we excluded all photons below 0.7 keV from our analysis.

For NuSTAR the source events were extracted within a 30-pixel (72arcsec) radius around the centroid. Appropriate background regions were selected to be on the same detector as the source location. Spectra were extracted using the nuproducts script.

Using grppha, channels 0-70 (< 0.7 keV) and 700-1023 (> 7  keV) for Swift data and channels 0-35 (< 3 keV) and 1935-4095 (> 79  keV) for NuSTAR data were ignored and all good channels were binned to have a minimum of one count per energy bin.

Fermi Large Area Telescope Observations

We downloaded Pass 8R2 events of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) [\citep=aaa+09a] all-sky survey observations from 2008 August 4 to 2016 July 30 from a one degree radius surrounding the Chandra position of PSR J1119-6127 and applied the recommended event selection. In the timing analysis, we used only photons having energy greater that 500 MeV based on the γ-ray pulse profile of PSR J1119-6127 [\citep=pkh+11]. We corrected the arrival times of each photon to the Solar System barycenter using the tempo2 fermi plug-in [\citep=rkp+11].

Results

Timing Analysis

Times-of-arrivals (TOAs) of γ-ray pulses were extracted using a maximum likelihood (ML) method, described in [\cite=lrc+09]. We extracted a TOA from photons collected in every 100 day span as a trade-off between TOA spacing and precision. We extended the ephemeris presented by [\citet=awe+15] using the LAT detected photons until the GBM-detected burst [\citep=ykr16]. We present a phase-coherent ephemeris in Table [\ref=tab:timing] and the timing residuals in the left panel of Figure [\ref=fig:resplot].

To determine an ephemeris for the post-outburst Swift and NuSTAR observations, we folded the soft X-ray photons (< 10 keV) from each observation, starting with the ephemeris from the LAT observations and extracted TOAs from each orbit using the ML method. As there is no apparent evolution in the pulse profiles over the < 10  keV energy band, the offset between TOAs from both telescopes should be minimal. We then used the tempo2 timing software package [\citep=hem06] to fit the TOAs.

It is apparent that the LAT ephemeris did not accurately describe the post-outburst TOAs and requires a change in the spin frequency. Due to the long integration times required to extract a TOA from LAT, we are unable to constrain the exact glitch epoch; for this analysis, we have fixed the glitch epoch to the time of the first GBM-detected burst [\citep=ykr16] and fitted for a glitch in spin frequency and frequency derivative.

We measure a spin-up glitch with [formula] Hz and [formula]Hz s- 1. We caution that this represents a snapshot of the frequency evolution, and that following glitches in magnetars, complex recoveries are often observed [\citep=dkg08] [\citep=dk14].

In Figure [\ref=fig:profs] we show the soft (0.7-2.5 keV), and hard (2.5-10 keV) X-ray pulse profiles from the radio pulsar state in 2011 [\citep=nkh+12], and the magnetar-like state in 2016. In the soft band, the root-mean-squared (RMS) pulse fraction has increased from 38(3)% to 71(4)%, while the pulse shape has remained similar. In the hard band, the RMS pulse fraction went from < 10% to 56(3)% pulsed.

X-ray Spectroscopy

All X-ray spectra were fit using XSPEC v12.9.0 [\citep=arn96] with a common value for hydrogen column density ([formula]). Magnetar spectra are typically described with an absorbed blackbody plus power-law model, which we use here. However, the independent Swift-XRT observations 00706396000 and 00034632002 were fit with a simple absorbed blackbody model between 0.7-7 keV as there is no constraint on the power law without the NuSTAR spectrum and there is little power-law contribution below 7 keV.

We used Cash statistics [\citep=cas79a] for fitting and parameter estimation of the unbinned data. [formula] was fit using wilm abundances and vern photoelectric cross-sections. The normalizations of NuSTAR FPMB and Swift-XRT spectra were allowed to vary with respect to that of the NuSTAR FPMA spectrum.

The hard X-ray tail seen above 8 keV in the PC mode observation (00706396000) may be caused by contamination due to short temporally unresolved X-ray bursts. Magnetar-like bursts are intrinsically harder than the average spectrum and the high count-rate leads to pile-up effects within the 2.5-s CCD readout time [\citep=sk11]. These pile-up effects are not mitigated by standard techniques such as the removal of the central bright region, as they are bunched temporally rather than spatially. If the hard X-ray tail were indeed real, it would have needed to fade by [formula] orders of magnitude in the day before the NuSTAR pointing to be consistent with the measured hard X-ray flux, while the blackbody temperatures measured on the two epochs are consistent with slow cooling. Hence, to fit the average spectra, we truncate the 00706396000 spectra above 7 keV.

Figure [\ref=fig:1119_all_spec] shows the current Swift+NuSTAR spectral fits in comparison with a pre-burst XMM-Newton spectrum [\citep=nkh+12]. Table [\ref=tab:nustar_spectra] details the parameter values with 90% confidence error bars.

Immediately after the burst, we measure a blackbody temperature kT = 1.10(6) keV, slightly decreasing to 0.96(1) keV and 0.93(1) keV in the follow-up spectra. This is substantially higher than the pre-burst blackbody temperature of 0.21(4) keV [\citep=nkh+12]. In the NuSTAR spectra, we also measure a hard power law with photon index Γ = 1.2(2) that is marginally harder than the pre-burst value [formula] [\citep=nkh+12]. We also note that [\citet=nkh+12] and [\citet=sk08] measured the power law emission from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) around PSR J1119-6127 to have [formula], close to the current hard power law index, but with a flux of [formula], almost three orders of magnitude fainter.

Discussion

The outburst from PSR J1119-  6127 is observationally very similar to those seen in magnetars. The phenomenology of magnetar outbursts is rich [\citep=re11], but with established commonalities, practically all of which are observed in the PSR J1119-  6127 event. A hallmark of magnetar outbursts are short-duration (< 1-s) hard X-ray bursts, as reported for PSR J1119-  6127 [\citep=klm+16] [\citep=ykr16]. The large flux enhancement, here by a factor of > 160, is commonly seen in magnetar outbursts, notably those in which the quiescent luminosity is below ~  1033 erg s- 1 [\citep=sk11] [\citep=kkp+12]. Moreover, the spectral hardening we report is classic for magnetar outbursts [\citep=re11], as are timing anomalies, most often spin-up glitches [\citep=dkg08] [\citep=dk14]. Overall, the PSR J1119-  6127 event is clearly magnetar-like.

Most similar to the PSR J1119-  6127 event is the 2006 magnetar-like outburst of PSR J1846-  0258 [\citep=ggg+08]. The latter is also a young (τ  <  1000 yr), high-B (B = 5  ×  1013 G) rotation-powered pulsar, albeit radio undetected [\citep=aklm08]. Next we compare this object's 2006 outburst with the event studied here.

One difference between the outbursts is their energetics. For PSR J1119-  6127, the 0.5-10-keV flux as measured in the joint Swift and NuSTAR observation was 4.1(1)  ×  10- 11 erg s- 1 cm- 2. For a distance of 8.4 kpc, and assuming isotropic emission, this implies a luminosity of 3.5  ×  1035 erg s- 1, or 0.1[formula]. This represents an increase over the quiescent value in this band of a factor of over [formula]. Including the flux from 10 keV extrapolated to the top of the NuSTAR band increases this value by ~  20%. The efficiency for conversion of [formula] to Fermi-band γ-ray emission, at least in quiescence, was estimated by [\citet=pkh+11] to be 0.23. With a comparable amount of energy suddenly appearing in X-rays, the Fermi-band emission may have been affected during this outburst. However, the normally low Fermi/LAT count rate (see §[\ref=sec:timing]) requires multiple weeks of integration for a detection, hence a short-term anomaly may be undetectable.

By contrast, for PSR J1846-  0258, in Chandra observations made within one week of its first detected magnetar-like burst, the unabsorbed flux in the 0.5-10-keV band was 4.0+ 1.6- 0.9  ×  10- 11 erg s- 1 cm- 2 [\citep=ggg+08]. For isotropic emission and a distance of 6 kpc [\citep=lt08], this implies a luminosity of 1.7  ×  1035 erg s- 1, or 0.02[formula]. This represented an increase of a factor of 7.7+ 3.9- 1.8 over the quiescent value. As this outburst had no realtime trigger, it is possible that initially the pulsar brightened more. However the pulsed flux measured by RXTE at the initial burst epoch was comparable a week later. Hence the increase in flux was probably not much larger than a factor of ~  10, never exceeding a few percent of [formula]. Thus energetically, the PSR J1119-  6127 outburst is far larger than that in PSR J1846-  0258.

The spectral evolution in the two events also differed. In quiescence, PSR J1846-  0258's X-ray spectrum is well described by a simple power law of index 1.1(1) [\citep=ggg+08], very different from the soft quiescent spectrum PSR J1119-  6127. The latter, well described by a blackbody of kT  =  0.21(4) keV and power law of index 2.1(8) [\citep=sk08] [\citep=nkh+12], made this pulsar the youngest with detected thermal emission. It was also one of the hottest and most luminous thermal emitters even among rotation-powered pulsars of similar age [\citep=ozv+13]. This emission was also noted to be unusual for its high pulsed fraction [\citep=nkh+12].

During outburst, PSR J1846-  0258 developed a bright soft component, whereas the harder power-law spectrum remained unchanged, apart from an increase in normalization by ~  35% above 10 keV [\citep=kh09]. The soft component was described as having a power-law spectrum of index 1.9(1) [\citep=ks08b] [\citep=ggg+08]. By contrast, the spectrum of PSR J1119-  6127 has undergone a radical hardening, with kT increasing from 0.21(4) keV to 1.10(6) keV. Nevertheless, the net effect in both outbursts was a transition to a spectrum very similar to those of bright magnetars.

It is also interesting to compare the outburst timing anomalies. In PSR J1846-  0258, it suffered a sudden spin-up having Δν  /  ν≃3  ×  10- 6, followed by a large increase in [formula] yielding a strong over-recovery of the glitch [\citep=lkg10] [\citep=kh09] [\citep=lnk+11]. The net long-term effect was a spin-down, accompanied by a change in braking index and a long-term enhancement in timing noise. While it is too early to know the post-outburst timing evolution in PSR J1119-  6127, from our timing analysis, we find that the pulsar had a similar-sized spin-up glitch with Δν  /  ν≃5.8  ×  10- 6. Presently any increase in spin-down rate is modest compared to some glitch recoveries in magnetars and certainly compared to that following the 2006 PSR J1846-  0258 glitch. However, greater evolution may yet be detected.

In young radio pulsars like PSR J1119-  6127, hard X-ray emission is thought to arise in the context of outer gap models [\citep=wtk13] from synchrotron radiation from secondary electron/positron pairs produced by inward propagating curvature radiation γ-rays. As discussed by [\citet=pkh+11], in PSR J1119-  6127, the X-ray/γ-ray phase offset, together with the single-peak morphology of the γ-ray pulse, are well explained in outer gap models. The luminosity of both the X-ray and γ-ray emission in this picture must be bounded by the spin-down power.

The increase in X-ray luminosity particularly in the hard X-ray range during the outburst of PSR J1846-  0258 was argued by [\citet=kh09] to be plausibly due to the above-described rotation-powered outer-gap emission, enhanced by particle injection due to perhaps to crust cracking that occurred at the glitch, reasonable given the lack of evidence for the hard X-ray luminosity exceeding more than a few percent of [formula].

The new hard X-ray emission component in PSR J1119-  6127 could have an outer-gap origin as well, but the large luminosity rise to within 0.1[formula] in the X-ray band alone may be difficult to accommodate in such a picture, and might require a commensurate increase in γ-ray luminosity, impossible given the available [formula] energy budget.

Alternatively, the hard X-ray emission may be magnetar-like. The origin of the bright hard X-ray component in magnetars has been argued to be a decelerating electron/positron flow in the closed magnetosphere, in the higher altitude regions of large magnetic loops [\citep=bel13]. This emission is powered ultimately by the internal stellar magnetic field and is not limited by [formula]. In this interpretation, the pulsar suffered an instability such that a significant twist in its field lines occurred, with highly relativistic particles (γ >  > 10) injected near the star where B >  > BQED  =  4.4  ×  1013 G. If this is origin of the hard X-rays in PSR J1119-  6127, then the true internal field of this pulsar is far higher than is inferred from its dipole component. This would support the argument for additional non-dipolar field components in apparently low-magnetic-field magnetars [\citep=ret+10] [\citep=skc14]. One way to test this explanation is through modelling of the phase-resolved hard X-ray spectrum. This can yield constraints on the geometry of the emission region [\citep=hbd14]. Such constraints could then be compared with similar ones from radio polarimetry [\citep=wje11] and/or modelling of the γ-ray light curve [\citep=pkh+11].

Importantly, PSRs J1846-  0258 and now J1119-  6127 are the only two rotation-powered pulsars to have exhibited radiative changes at glitch epochs; this must be a consequence of their high spin-inferred B. Indeed no X-ray enhancement was seen in Chandra observations made 3.5 days following a large (Δν  /  ν  =  3  ×  10- 6) spin-up glitch in the lower-field (B = 3.4  ×  1012 G) Vela radio pulsar [\citep=hgh01]. On the other hand, there was no evidence for an X-ray enhancement in PSR J1846-  0258 near the epoch of a much smaller glitch having Δν  /  ν  =  2.5  ×  10- 9 [\citep=lkgk06], nor in previous glitches (Δν  /  ν  =  2.9  ×  10- 7 and 4.1  ×  10- 6 in 2004 and 2007, respectively) in PSR J1119-  6127 [\citep=wje11] [\citep=awe+15], although prompt X-ray observations were not performed in those cases. Moreover, multiple sizeable glitches in bona fide magnetars have been unaccompanied by radiative changes [\citep=sak+14] [\citep=dk14]. This may indicate that an independent parameter such as the crustal depth of the glitch location plays a role in the radiative detectability of high-B neutron-stars at glitch epochs [\citep=ec89a] [\citep=let02].

The possibility of a magnetar-like outburst from a high-B radio pulsar was discussed by [\citet=km05], who also suggested the possibility of radio emission from magnetars prior to its discovery by [\citet=crh+06]. [\citet=pp11a] and [\citet=pp11b] provided theoretical groundwork for the hypothesis, and magnetothermal modelling such as that by [\citet=vrp+13] have further developed these ideas, which are now on solid observational ground. Other high-B radio pulsars like PSRs J1718-  3718 [\citep=zkm+11] and J1734-  3333 [\citep=ozv+13] seem likely to also undergo a magnetar-like transition in coming years.
