Emptying Dirac valleys in bismuth by magnetic field

Like spin and unlike momentum, the valley degree of freedom is a discrete quantum number of Bloch waves in a crystal, with a potential for storing information. 'Valleytronics'[\cite=Rycerz] has been initially explored in AlAs-based two-dimensional electron gas [\cite=Shayegan] and subsequently in a variety of systems such as graphene[\cite=Xiao2007], transition-metal dichalcogenides[\cite=Xu2014], diamond[\cite=Isberg] and silicon[\cite=Renard]. A rotating magnetic field can modulate the contribution of anistropic valleys to the total conductivity[\cite=Zhu2012] [\cite=Collaudin] [\cite=Jo2014]. In bismuth, this effect is visible even at room temperature and in presence of a field as weak as 0.5 T[\cite=Zhu2012] [\cite=Collaudin].

The large orbital magnetoresistance of bismuth has been known for several decades[\cite=Kapitza]. Following the recent observation of a large magnetoresistance in WTe2[\cite=Ali2014], the amplitude of magnetoresistance in compensated semi-metals has attracted much attention[\cite=Ali2014] [\cite=Liang2015] [\cite=Shekhar2015] [\cite=Novak2015]. These studies have brought to foreground a fundamental yet unanswered questions: What sets the magnitude and field dependence of orbital magnetoresistance in the high-field regime where the scattering time exceeds by far the cyclotron period[\cite=Song2015] [\cite=Abrikosov]?

A longstanding open question in condensed-matter physics is the fate of the three-dimensional electron gas pushed beyond the quantum limit[\cite=halperin]. When electrons are confined to their lowest Landau levels, the Coulomb interaction, neglected in the single-particle treatment of electrons, is expected to play a significant role. While many dilute metals are pushed beyond the quantum limit, graphite remains the only system in which electronic instabilities[\cite=Fauque2013], believed to be charge-density-wave states[\cite=Yaguchi2009], have been detected. A unified picture of this regime and the consequences of multiple valleys are yet to be drawn.

We present a study of magnetoresistance in bismuth angle-dependent up to 65 T and fixed-angle up to 90T with implications for our understanding of magnetoresistance in a multi-valley electron system far beyond the quantum limit. Previous studies demonstrated that by lifting the degeneracy of anisotropic valleys, magnetic field affects their contribution to the total conductivity[\cite=Zhu2012] [\cite=Collaudin] [\cite=Jo2014]. When the quantum limit is approached, even the carrier population in each valley becomes different[\cite=Zhu2011]. However prior to these measurements magnetic fields high enough to wipe out a valley evaporating its Fermi sea had not been applied. Our study detects a large anisotropic drop in magnetoresistance. Comparing the data with theoretical calculations, we argue that this drop happens because one or two Fermi seas, depending on the orientation of magnetic field, totally dry up. Thus, bismuth becomes the only solid in which the amplitude of the magnetic field to attain 100 percent valley polarization, is known and attainable. The semi-classic and multi-valley[\cite=Aubrey] picture of non-interacting electrons provides a qualitative explanation of the observation. The large drop in magnetoresistance is a consequence of transfer of carriers from a high-mobility to a low-mobility valley. A quantitatively model for the drop of resistance at B[formula] would require a full consideration of the role of Coulomb interactions.

As reminded in panels a-c of Fig. 1, bismuth is a compensated semi-metal with electrons at L-point on top of a very small gap and with a quasi-linear dispersion, giving rise to three Dirac valleys, which are elongated Fermi surface ellipsoids located at the boundary of the Brillouin zone (For a review see[\cite=Fuseya2015a]). The extreme anisotropy of these ellipsoids make them quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) metals. In real space, Bloch waves of each three Q2D metal can be easily displaced by electric field along the trigonal axis and one of the three binary axes, but not along the third perpendicular orientation, one of the three bisectrix axes. The rhombohedral structure of the bismuth crystal can be seen as a distortion of two interpenetrating FCC structures (Fig. 1c). For each valley index, the preferential charge flow along a binary axis favors one out of the three bonds linking atoms of one FFC network (in yellow) to two of its nearest neighbors belonging to the other FCC network (in black)(Fig. 1c). According to the present findings, a sufficiently strong magnetic field can completely freeze one or two of these three equivalent channels.

Our principal experimental result is presented in Fig. 1d. For both binary and bisectrix orientations of magnetic field, the magnetoresistance stops to increase and begins to drop when the field exceeds 35 T. When the field is along the binary axis, the drop is more drastic and starts at a slightly higher magnetic field. As we will see below, both these features find a natural explanation if the drop is due to the total evacuation of one or two electron pockets. The angle dependence of the magnetoresistance presented in a polar plot in Fig. 1e clarifies the link between this result and previous studies of angle-dependent magnetoresistance in bismuth[\cite=Zhu2012] [\cite=Collaudin]. As seen in the figure, at 5 T, angular oscillations of magnetoresistance are visible, arising from the anisotropy of the mobility. For each ellipsoid the magnetoresistance is larger when the field is along its longer axis. As the field increases, the relative magnitude of the oscillations are damped because the relative contribution of the hole pocket to the total conductivity is enhanced. At 55 T, however, pronounced angular oscillations appear again with an amplitude much larger than what seen at low fields. Note also the loss of threefold symmetry[\cite=Zhu2012] [\cite=Collaudin] [\cite=Kuechler], which leads to the slight but visible different in œÅ(B) for nominally equivalent binary and bisectrix axes. The origin of this field-induced 'nematicty' is a subject of ongoing research. We also measured magnetoresistance of another bismuth crystal up to 90.5 T with magnetic field oriented along the binary axis and found that the system remains metallic with significant implications for the landua sepctrum as discusses below.

Before discussing the origin of the drop in magnetoresistance, let us consider the Landau spectrum of bismuth in the present configuration. Our data extends the maps of Landau spectrum in bismuth previously drawn up to 12 T[\cite=Zhu2011] and 28T[\cite=Zhu2012a] based on studies of the Nernst effect, to 65 T. Fig. 2 shows the theoretical evolution of the Landau levels, the Fermi energy (a and d), the carrier concentration (b and e) and its distribution among valleys (c and f) with magnetic field[\cite=Supplement]. With magnetic field perpendicular to the trigonal axis and exceeding 15 T, electrons are confined to the lowest spin-polarized Landau sub-level(0e -) and holes occupy their three (each doubly degenerate) lowest Landau levels. With increasing magnetic field, three events occur at successive magnetic fields. The 2h and 1h Landau levels cross the Fermi level and last occupied electron LL for one (when B//bisectrix) or two (when B//binary) pockets becomes empty. The Fermi energy is significantly affected by a modest magnetic field. This is because the carriers are light (almost a thousandth of the free electron mass along bisectrix[\cite=Zhu2011]) and therefore the cyclotron energy is large. Charge neutrality imposes equality between electron and hole concentrations. Since electron degeneracy rises faster than hole degeneracy, the Fermi energy shifts downward with magnetic field up to 20 T. The evacuation of each hole Landau level produces a deceleration kink in this downward shift. Note the non-monotonic field-dependence of the (0e -) level for different valleys. It depends on the magnitude of the interband coupling and the the g-factor corrections[\cite=Supplement] and sets the field at which a valley becomes empty.

As seen in panels b and e, the carrier concentration is drastically modified by magnetic field. It increases first, before saturating and dropping at higher fields. The distribution of carriers among electron pockets (panels c and f) is also strongly affected by magnetic field. It ends up by total evacuation of one or two electron valleys. Thus, magnetic field can weigh enough on the balance of energy to dry a Fermi sea without causing a metal-insulator transition. The total number of remaining electrons is still matching the number of holes respecting charge neutrality and keeping the system metallic.

Fig. 3a presents a color map of the angle-dependent magnetoresistance. The angular evolution of the second derivative is presented in Fig. 3b and 3c. The evacuation of each hole Landau level occurs at a field which does not strongly vary much with azimuthal angle. The Zeeman splitting of the hole Landau levels vanishes when the field is perfectly perpendicular to the trigonal axis[\cite=Fuseya], but becomes finite in case of slight misalignment. With these features in mind, one can identify the horizontal bright lines of Fig.3b as hole Landau levels and their bifurcation at intermediate angles as the result of finite Zeeman splitting arising from imperfect alignment. The experimental data in panel c is to be compared with the theoretical angle-dependent Landau spectrum of panel d (which takes into account the misalignment[\cite=Supplement]). The excellent agreement validates parameters used for the simulation. The drop in magnetoresistance occurs when the 0- electron Landau level of a valley crosses the chemical potential, leaving no carriers in the valley.

The large drop in magnetoresistance cannot be due to the evacuation of the 1h hole level, as suggested decades ago by authors observing the onset of this drop[\cite=Miura1983] [\cite=Miura1994] and using a theoretical model contradicted by the absence of metal-insulator transition evidenced by Fig.1f (See[\cite=Supplement] for details). This interpretation becomes implausible due to the sharp angular dependence of the drop resolved here. Why is the drop much larger than any other quantum oscillation arising from the evacuation of a hole or electron Landau level (Fig. 1 d, f) and has a different temperature dependence? Why it is more than twice larger and significantly wider when the field is along the binary axis? Such questions find straightforward answers as soon as one considers the consequences of emptying an electron valley by magnetic field.

As seen in Fig. 1d, magnetoresistance in bismuth is approximately linear in field over an extended window of magnetic field up to 25T. Its angle dependence in presence of moderate magnetic field can be quantitatively explained in a semi-classical approach taking carrier mobility as a tensor[\cite=Collaudin]. The non-trivial field dependence of magnetoresistance (its deviation from the quadratic behavior expected for a compensated semi-metal) reflects the fact that both carrier density and the components of the mobility tensor vary with magnetic field[\cite=Song2015]. In this context, a large change in magnetoresistance can arise for three different reasons. i) A change in total carrier concentration; ii) A change in the occupation of different valleys; iii) A change in the relevant mobility component. Let us examine each of these possibilities.

As seen in Fig. 2, following the evacuation of 1h Landau level, carrier concentration decreases. This would lead to an enhancement (and not a decrease) in magnetoresistance. Whatever causes the drop in magnetoresistance should counter and outweigh the enhancement due to the decreased carrier number. On the other hand, the change in the fraction of electrons occupying each valley (shown in panels c and f of Fig. 2) would generate a drop in magnetoresistance according to what we know of the mobility anisotropy of each valley. When the field is parallel to the longer axis of one electron ellipsoid, the relevant component of the mobility tensor for electrons in this ellipsoid is large. When this valley is emptied and its electrons move to the other two, the relevant component of the mobility tensor is significantly lower. As a consequence, magnetoresistance drops. When the magnetic field is along the binary axis, two valleys become empty with consequences more drastic than emptying one, hence a larger drop in magnetoresistance. As seen in panels c and f of Fig. 2, the field window for carrier transfer between valleys is remarkably close to the width of the experimentally-observed drop in magnetoresistance.

Thus, transfer of carriers from one valley to another provides a qualitative explanation for our observation. We note that this interpretation bears a similarity to the Gunn effect[\cite=Gunn]. In a semiconductor such as GaAs, a sufficiently strong electric field can displace carriers from one band to another causing a change in differential conductivity[\cite=Blakemore]. The effect we are observing here is also a consequence of carrier transfer between branches with different mobilities caused by magnetic (and not electric) field.

A quantitative explanation of the magnitude of the drop requires an accurate knowledge of the evolution of the mobility tensor across B[formula]. We note that there is a correlation between the boundaries of the triangular blue regions of Fig. 3a and the contours of Landau levels in Fig. 3d. As highlighted by a red circle, two electron lines and one hole line meet together where the drop in magnetoresistance occurs and emphasize that such a meeting never occurs for Landau levels with a higher index number. When this meeting occurs( for B ~   50 T [formula] binary), the energy cost of a trion (a charged exciton with two electrons and one hole) becomes vanishingly small, since the kinetic energy of L-point electrons and T-pont holes becomes zero. Trions which have been observed in semiconductors subject to frequency-tuned photons[\cite=Kheng1993]. The formation of excitons in a semi-metal such as bismuth as a consequence of Coulomb attraction between electrons and holes is a longstanding idea[\cite=Halperin]. The angle-dependent Landau spectrum emerging from this study specifies a region where their energy cost drops to zero. At this stage, we can only speculate if it is more than accidental that the experimentally-observed change in magnetoresistance occurs when bound electron-hole excitations have little energy cost. A detailed discussion of different scenarios for field dependence of mobility in the semi-classic picture to explain the drop in magnetoresistance suggests a change in the components of the mobility tensor in the vicinity at B[formula] [\cite=Supplement]. It is tempting to make a link between this feature and the vanishing energy cost of charged excitons.

Our study identifies bismuth as the first solid in which cyclotron energy is strong enough to dry a Fermi sea. This happens because of a unique combination of several features. First of all, the system is dilute and therefore the Fermi energy is small. Second, the carriers are light and both the cyclotron and the Zeeman energy are large. Third, unlike graphene, bismuth is not a perfect Dirac system. In a perfect Dirac system, the spin is locked to angular momentum leading to a cancellation of field-induced cyclotron and Zeeman shifts. Therefore, the lowest Landau level does not shift with magnetic field. The non-trivial evolution of the lowest Landau level[\cite=Supplement] leads to the total evacuation of a valley in an attainable magnetic field. By shrinking the Fermi surface with Sb doping[\cite=Fuseya], one may lower B[formula] sufficiently to make field-induced hundred-percent valley polarization as accessible as its spin counterpart.
