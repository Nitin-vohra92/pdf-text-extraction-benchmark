Exclusions on Z' mass and its non-universal couplings in LFV decays

Introduction

We have different motivations to explore lepton sector, taking a new gauge neutral boson as mediator in LFV. We explore new scenarios with flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) to obtain bounds for the model parameters [\cite=Demir:2005ti], and it could imply new physics (NP). The current (or future) colliders could use the data to discard some theoretical models.

One of the simplest model extends the symmetry group of the standard model (SM). This kind of extension introduces an extra symmetry group [formula] that is labeled [formula] with charge λ. The new symmetry group is: [formula] In this type of extensions, the scalar sector would have six degree of freedom: four from Higgs doublet, and two from the singlet [\cite=Basso:2010jt]. However we will consider that the only difference with respect the SM Lagrangian is the introduced potential term and the kinetic term for the singlet field [\cite=Basso:2010pe] [\cite=Basso:2009gg].

Nowadays, there are experimental motivations to explore new physics scenarios; e.g., the recent results from CMS and ATLAS collaborations [\cite=CMS:2015dxe] [\cite=Aad:2015pfa] and LHCb preliminary results for B+  →  K+μ+μ-(e+e-) process have been an incentive to consider family non-universal (FNU) coupling. It will be studied by Babar, Belle (II) and LHCb [\cite=LHCP-2014] [\cite=Babar-collabo] [\cite=Belle-collabo] [\cite=CLEO-collabo].

There are a lot of reports containing physics and phenomenology on Z' in different contexts [\cite=Langacker:2008yv] [\cite=Langacker:2009im] [\cite=Leike:1998wr] [\cite=Erler:1999ub] [\cite=Abada:2015zea] [\cite=Bandyopadhyay:2014sma], others that constrain the parameters related to Z' [\cite=Kundu:1995gr] [\cite=Erler:2009jh] and several letters on new neutral gauge bosons and Higgs particle [\cite=Edelhauser:2014yra] [\cite=Li:2013ava] [\cite=Diaz-Cruz:2013kpa] [\cite=Lopez:2013hsa]. Some papers about NP with universal and FNU couplings, which are given by the different values for the fermion couplings, can be found in [\cite=Bernabeu:1993ta] [\cite=Langacker:2000ju] [\cite=Chiang:2011cv] [\cite=Barger:2009eq] [\cite=Barger:2009qs] [\cite=Arhrib:2006sg] with interesting phenomenological results. Other papers considering FNU couplings for B - decays are [\cite=Chang:2013hba] [\cite=Li:2011nf] [\cite=Sirvanli:2013fts]. An increasing number of papers considering FNU couplings have appeared recently; e.g., on rare semilepton decays [\cite=Chang:2011jka], on leptonic channels including right-handed neutrinos [\cite=La:2013gga], and, even about G(221) models [\cite=Hsieh:2010zr]. There also are papers considering a new gauge neutral boson coupling to the fermions of the third family [\cite=Holdom:2008xx] [\cite=Erler:1999nx]. In our paper the θ' (mixing angle ZZ') parameter appears in the equations, explicitly. We will fix that parameter respecting the precision measurements imposed, this is: [formula] [\cite=Abreu:1994ria]. Besides we will use some reports to explore new models as E6, Left-Right and others.

In this letter we will analyze the most representative lepton processes in order to constrain the new neutral gauge boson mass and its flavor-changing (FC) non-universal couplings. Basically, we explore the gfifjV,A parameters which differs from the current literature where εL,R chiral coupling are taken ([formula] [\cite=Langacker:2008yv]). Section [\ref=sec:chan-fla-ori] describes the FC for this model in fermion sector and we show the lagrangian for the model. Section [\ref=sec:leton-processes], presents lepton and semi-lepton FV, and hadron decays. Finally, in section [\ref=sec:discussion] we discuss the results and state our conclusions.

About the model: Lagrangian

We shall consider a general Lagrangian for fermions and new neutral gauge boson which is very similar to the standard model. In this context, the models could introduce new fermions and new SM fermion charges under the new symmetry group. So the model obtains FC through: a) the mixing of the SM fermions with the new fermions (introduced to avoid anomalies [\cite=Langacker:2000ju] [\cite=La:2013gga]), b) the SM fermion charges under the extra group can be FNU [\cite=Barger:2009qs] [\cite=Cleaver:1998sm] [\cite=Cleaver:1997jb] [\cite=Masip:1999mk]. We are interested in the second method.

In the next subsections we consider different scenarios which have a pedagogical motivation and we assume to respect the CKM bounds.

Lagrangian for the family universal model

In a family universal model, the vertex fZ' is proportional to fermion charges:

[formula]

We consider a rotation to the mass eigenstates fL  =  VLf0L, where [formula] ([formula] means interaction eigenstates) and VL is a orthogonal transformation matrix; e.g.:

[formula]

where cij  =   cos θij and sij  =   sin θij. Then:

[formula]

where QL is the family universal coupling. If the charges are same, matrix [formula] is diagonal and there is not mixing.

Lagrangian for the family non-universal model

In this subsection, we present the way the non-universal couplings generate the flavor-change, namely:

[formula]

As before, we obtain,

[formula]

Charges are family non-universal so the matrix [formula] is not diagonal. this scenario is interesting to explore the FC mediated by new neutral gauge boson.

We will explore models with FNU couplings with gauge group given by: [formula] We labeled qλ as the SM fermion charges under [formula] these are family-depending. We could have Z' effects if we suppose [formula] and these could be detectable in LHC or in future colliders.

Sample in the lepton sector

We recall the Lagrangian for the neutral currents sector, which is considered [\cite=Langacker:1991pg] [\cite=Amaldi:1987fu] [\cite=Langacker:2000ju] [\cite=Andrianov:1998hx]:

[formula]

where ψf and [formula] are the weak gauge eigenstates. [formula] are the vector and axial-vector associated to the fZ; and [formula] those associated to couplings fZ' vertex, and we will consider [formula] Z1μ  ,Z2μ are the gauge eigenstates associated to Z and Z' through

[formula]

respectively. We can re-write the [\eqref=eq:lagrangian_gral_CN_CS] as:

[formula]

where θ' is the mixing angle Z - Z' and

[formula]

The eq. [\eqref=eq:lagrangiano_gA_gV] shows the explicit dependence with gfifjV,A. Now on we consider the neutral current sector for Z', so we will neglect the prime label. Now we have a sector

with non-universal cuplings and

proportional to the charges qλ through gfifjV,A.

Phenomenology: lepton and hadron sector

We obtained the decay width using FeynCalc package [\cite=Mertig:1990an]; namely,

[formula]

where F1  =  gliljA2  +  gliljV2,  F2  =  gliljVgliljA and [formula] This result shows the symmetry-changing under [formula] and [formula] Besides, it has the g'1,MZ' and θ' parameters, explicitly, so then the dependence with the model parameters.

τ-  →  μ-μ+μ- decay

Branching ratio for τ  →  μ-μ+μ- process, which is represented in fig. [\ref=fd:tau-mumumu]. The width corresponding is given by eq. [\eqref=eq:W_l-lllb], considering li  =  τ- and lj  =  lk  =  μ-.

We have explored two cases: I) g'1  =  gEW. In this case we obtain constraints on Z' mass for different models (see fig. [\ref=fig-tau-Zp-mumumu-I]). Figure [\ref=fig-tau-Zp-mumumu-I] shows the [formula] for: 331 models, E6 models with the parameter [formula] Z'χ, Z'ψ and Z'η, respectively; Left-Right (LR) and alternative Left-Right (ALR) models. Besides we show the experimental bound. We used the recent results for the [formula], then we calculated the limits for the [formula] in several models those values appear in table [\ref=ta:Br-tau-mumumu-I].

For the case II) g'1  =  0.105 taken from [\cite=Langacker:2000ju]. This case works to constrain every model since [formula] and this mass range is excluded for experiments [\cite=Beringer:1900zz].

μ-  →  e-e+e- decay

The Feynman diagram for this process is shown in fig. [\ref=fd:tau-eee]. The decay width is given by eq. [\eqref=eq:W_l-lllb], considering li  =  μ- and lj  =  lk  =  e-. From the constraints the last section we explore the μ-  →  e-e+e-. We found [formula] it can see on fig. [\ref=fig-gVfifj-gAfifj-EW] where the green region is favored.

The process in the hadron sector

We have taken motivations from recent experimental results. Nowadays experimental data give constraints for τ-  →  μ-π+π- process in different colliders (see table [\ref=ta:B-BB-CLEO-t-mu-pipi]).

Even more we expect Belle II has surprising physical results when it achieves high luminosity (in 2022), this is 50 times more than Belle [\cite=Abe:2010gxa].

The model for the hadron sector

The hadronic pair (π+π-) is produced, at the beginning, in a initial state no hadrons [formula] where Q and q are light quarks (u,d,s). The weak current has the form [\cite=FloresBaez:2006gf]:

[formula]

but the second term has not contribution because of the G-parity. We have used [formula] and [formula], with auu,dd are couplings asociated to each state uū,d. Then the hadron element matrix is given by:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] [\cite=PDG-2014]. The form factor, Fπ(q2), is the most simple, and useful form to use in our model, other forms can be found in refs. [\cite=FloresTlalpa:2005fz] [\cite=Diehl:1999ek] [\cite=Polyakov:1998ze] [\cite=Roig:2011iv].

The Feynman diagram for the process τ-  →  μ-π+π- is shown by fig. [\ref=fd:l-lbpipi]. The total amplitud is given by,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] In this letter we will use [formula] Taking [formula] and [formula] we obtained the eq. [\eqref=eq:dw-tau-2body] for the decay width; this is,

[formula]

where FijVA  =  gfifjV2  +  gfifjA2,   G  =  x2 + 3x(y - 1) + 4(y - 1)2,   [formula] and [formula] The x and y are variables: 1 - x  <  y  <  1 + x,  0  <  x  <  1. We use the constraints given in [\cite=Beringer:1900zz] and the results is shown in fig. [\ref=fig:l-lbpipi]. In this process we found that the lowest mass is [formula], considering the lepton flavor-changing, τ  →  μ. In fact, the eq. [\eqref=eq:dw-tau-2body] depends on gfifjV,A parameters.

Discussion and conclusions

In this letter we explore some models with a Z' which has family non-universal coupling in processes with FC as τ-  →  μ-μ+μ- and μ-  →  e-e+e-, and the τ  →  μ-π+π- process (hadronic process). We have obtained estimation for the Z' mass and its parameter, and considering the current experimental results, we found some representative values for the MZ' and regions for the parameters, which contains the FNU charges.

Figure [\ref=fig-tau-Zp-mumumu-I]  shows a excluded mass range for different models in lepton processes considering FC, this mass range could be explored for next colliders. From the τ-  →  μ-μ+μ- process, we report [formula] for g'1 = gEW (gauge coupling) and gfifJV  =  10- 1,gfifJA  =  10- 3 or viceversa, since equations are symmetrical under gfifJV  ↔  gfifJA. For the process μ-  →  e-e+e-, we note [formula] for [formula] and from τ-  →  μ-π+π- process, we found [formula] considering gfifJV  =  10- 1, - 2 and gfifJA  =  10- 4.

We regarding the experimental bounds for the [formula] process, which restrict the parameter space (see fig. [\ref=fig-gVfifj-gAfifj-EW]): the bounded region for the overlapping gives the most interesting values for the vector and vector-axial couplings, considering FC in lepton process. Exploring the hadron processes, we also exclude a mass range, figure [\ref=fig:l-lbpipi]. The excluded regions are consistent with the experimental results [\cite=Agashe:2014kda], see table [\ref=ta:Br-tau-mumumu-I].

Using the recent results from LHC, we  have  constrained the gfifjV,A parameters, besides found the lowest mass allowed for a Z' coming from some models, considering a FC currents, family non-universal coupling; and a process comes from hadron sector. Though we report high mass limits for a new neutral gauge boson, we are optimistic about the LHC results as well as next generation colliders.
