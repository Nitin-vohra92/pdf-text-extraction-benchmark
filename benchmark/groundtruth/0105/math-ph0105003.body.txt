Corollary Lemma

Locus configurations and [formula]-systems

Introduction

In the paper [\cite=V1] (see also [\cite=V2]) a mysterious relation between the configurations of hyperplanes appeared in the theory of generalised quantum Calogero-Moser systems (locus configurations [\cite=CFV]) and the so-called [formula]-systems describing the special solutions of the generalised WDVV equations has been observed. In this paper we investigate this relation further.

Our first result is a new family of the locus configurations, which are not related to the WDVV equations (at least, in the way described in [\cite=V1]). This shows that the relation between the locus configurations and [formula]-systems is not general and is applied only to a special subclass of the locus configurations, thus answering one of the questions raised in [\cite=V1].

Another interesting feature of the new family is that it gives the first examples of the locus configurations in dimension more than two for which corresponding Baker-Akhiezer functions do not satisfy the so-called "old axiomatics" (see [\cite=CFV] for details). It is plausible that the subclass of the locus configurations related to [formula]-systems is the one with old axiomatics.

As a by-product we have new examples of hyperbolic equations satisfying the Huygens' principle (in Hadamard's narrow sense). The general relation between locus configurations and Huygens' principle has been established in [\cite=CFV]. We should mention that as a particular two-dimensional case our family contains the configuration first discovered by Yu.Berest and I.Lutsenko in the relation with Huygens' principle [\cite=BL].

Another our result is two new multiparameter families of the [formula]-systems in dimension n. As a corollary we obtain new solutions of the generalised WDVV equation.

Generalised quantum CMS problem and locus configurations

The famous Calogero-Moser-Sutherland integrable model describes a pairwise interaction of N particles on the line with the potential which in trigonometric case has the form

[formula]

Olshanetsky and Perelomov [\cite=OP] were the first to consider the generalisations of this problem related to any root system R∈n. Corresponding operator has the form

[formula]

where A is a set of positive roots and gα are some parameters prescribed to the roots in a way invariant under the action of the corresponding Weyl group W. Its quantum integrability in the sense of existence of n pairwise commuting quantum integrals has been shown in full generality first by Heckman and Opdam (see [\cite=H] and references therein).

In the papers [\cite=CV],[\cite=VSC] we have shown that if the parameters have a special form gα  =  mα(mα + 1)(α,α) with integer mα then the operator ([\ref=1]) has more than n quantum integrals, which by definition means the algebraic integrability (see [\cite=VSC] for precise formulations). In that case the operator ([\ref=1]) can be intertwined with L0  =    -  Δ: there exists a differential operator D such that

[formula]

Surprisingly enough it turned out [\cite=VFC] (see also [\cite=CFV]) that the same properties are valid for the operators ([\ref=1]) for other finite configurations A. The first examples of such non-root configurations have been found in [\cite=VFC]. They consist of the following vectors in [formula]:

[formula]

Here m is an integer parameter, and the multiplicity m* is the maximum of m and - 1 - m. We should mention that in [\cite=CFV] [\cite=VFC] we have denoted this system as An(m). The reason for the change of notation will be clear from section 3 below.

The question of quantum algebraic integrability for the operators

[formula]

and their rational limits

[formula]

for a general finite set of noncollinear vectors A with prescribed multiplicities led to the notion of the locus conditions and locus configurations [\cite=CFV].

In the rational case we say that the potential

[formula]

satisfies the locus conditions if

[formula]

near every hyperplane Pα:(α,x)  =  0. Here sα stands for the reflection with respect to this hyperplane. In the trigonometric case we assume additionally that the set [formula] generates a [formula]-lattice of rank ≤  n and demand the locus conditions ([\ref=loc]) to be valid for any hyperplane [formula], where the potential has a pole. As it was shown in [\cite=C] these conditions are sufficient for the existence of the intertwining operator D ( and thus for the algebraic integrability).

We will call a finite set A of noncollinear vectors in a (complex) Euclidean space a locus configuration if the corresponding potential of the operator ([\ref=2]) (and thus of the operator ([\ref=3])) satisfies the locus conditions ([\ref=loc]).

The list of all known so far locus configurations in dimension more than 2 is presented in [\cite=CFV]. Besides the root systems and the configuration An,1(m) mentioned above it contains the following family

[formula]

Here k,l,m are integer parameters related as [formula], and k*,l*,m* have the same meaning as in An,1(m) case.

For all these configurations the corresponding Baker-Akhiezer function [\cite=CFV] satisfies the so-called "old axiomatics" introduced in [\cite=CV] which implies the new axiomatics [\cite=CFV] valid for any locus configuration. In dimension two there are examples of the locus configurations first discovered by Berest and Lutsenko [\cite=BL] for which old axiomatics is not valid. The question whether it is true or not in dimension more than two was open until now. In the next section we will give the answer to this question by presenting a new family of the locus configurations which do not satisfy the old axiomatics. Actually we will classify all the locus configurations of a certain type and show that besides the known cases the list contains one new interesting family.

Locus configurations of A type

Let us consider a system [formula] which consists of the vectors

[formula]

Here [formula] is a standard basis in [formula] and [formula] are some prescribed parameters. We suppose that all the vectors α∈A are non-isotropic, i.e. μ2i  +  μ2j  ≠  0 for all i,j. Altogether we have n(n - 1) / 2 + n parameters mij,μi. The question we address here is when such a system A is a locus configuration, i.e. when the potential in [\eqref=3] satisfies the locus conditions [\eqref=loc]. Note that the complex orthogonal group acts naturally on the set of all locus configurations. In particular, the class of configurations we consider is invariant under the action of the group [formula] generated by permutations of the coordinates and sign flips. In our classification below we will not differ between configurations equivalent modulo W.

To start with, we recall that according to [\cite=CFV] A is a locus configuration if and only if all its two-dimensional subsystems satisfy the locus conditions (see theorem 4.1 in [\cite=CFV]). So, let us start from considering a system A0 consisting of three vectors

[formula]

with multiplicities (mα,mβ,mγ) = (m,l,k).

The system [formula] as above satisfies the locus conditions in the following cases only:

[formula]

(Notice that the partial case m = 1 of (3) appears also in the family (4).)

This result is similar to the classification of all three-line locus configurations on the plane (theorem 4.4 from [\cite=CFV]), and can be proven in a similar way. To begin with, notice that the conditions [\eqref=loc] are equivalent to the vanishing along Πα of some first odd normal derivatives of the potential u(x). More explicitly, they can be reformulated as follows: for all [formula]

[formula]

Applying this for our particular case, we arrive at the following conditions:

[formula]

plus similar conditions for β and γ. Suppose that mα > 1, then from the first two relations in [\eqref=loc2] we deduce immediately that (α,β)2 = (α,γ)2, or a2 = b2, and hence mβ = mγ. As a result, we see that if at least two of the multiplicities (mα,mβ,mγ) are greater than 1, then they all must be the same and a2 = b2 = c2, which up to sign flips gives us the Coxeter case (1).

Another possibility is (mα,mβ,mγ) = (m,1,1) with m > 1. As we know already, in this case a2 = b2 which provides the conditions [\eqref=loc2]. The two remaining locus conditions are: which gives m(m + 1)(a2 + b2)b2 = 2(c2 + a2)c2 and leads to the families (2) and (3).

Finally, for the remaining case (mα,mβ,mγ) = (1,1,1) we have three locus conditions It is easy to see that there are only two possibilities: either a2 = b2 = c2 or a2 + b2 + c2 = 0. The first one gives us the Coxeter case while the second one leads to the family (4).

The system [formula] as in [\eqref=a] satisfies the locus conditions in the following cases only: (1) [formula] and [formula] (Coxeter case); (2) [formula], [formula] for all i,j < n, min = 1 for all i, [formula]; (3) [formula], [formula] for all i,j < n, min = 1 for all i, [formula]; (4) [formula], [formula] for all 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n - 2, mi,n - 1 = mi,n = mn - 1,n1 for all i  ≤  n - 2, [formula], [formula]; (5) n = 3, [formula], μ21  +  μ22  +  μ23 = 0.

As we mentioned already, all we have to do is to check the locus conditions for every two-dimensional subsystem in A. So, let us take any two-dimensional plane Π in [formula] and consider the set [formula] assuming that it is nonempty. Then there are three possibilities:

1) A0 consists of one vector;

2) A0 consists of two perpendicular vectors;

3) A0 consists of three vectors μiei  -  μjej,μjej  -  μkek,μiei  -  μkek for some i < j < k.

In the first two cases A0 is a locus system for trivial reasons. So, essentially, the locus conditions for the system A reduce to the requirement that for all i < j < k the subsystem A0 as in 3) must be one of those listed in Proposition 1.

Let us consider first the case n = 4. We have four different subsystems as in 3). The main point is that they cannot all be of the type [\eqref=f4]. Indeed, in that case we would have that

[formula]

which would imply that μ1  =  μ2  =  μ3  =  μ4 = 0. Thus, either all of these subsystems are of the Coxeter type [\eqref=f1], or at least one of them is of type [\eqref=f2]-[\eqref=f3]. In the latter case, if we suppose that μ2  =  μ3  =  μ and [formula] then for μ4 we have only two possibilities: either μ4  =  μ, or [formula]. Therefore, all possible locus configurations for n = 4 are listed in the theorem. The general n > 4 case follows in a similar manner.

Notice that we classified all the systems [\eqref=a] for which the corresponding rational potential [\eqref=3] satisfies the locus conditions. As a matter of fact, the trigonometric version [\eqref=2] of the resulting potentials will also satisfy the locus conditions. This is enough to check for all two-dimensional subsystems, which is not difficult. An explanation for this phenomenon (that the weaker rational locus conditions imply much stronger trigonometric ones) is due to the fact that from the very beginning the system [\eqref=a] was affine-equivalent to the standard root system of type A.

As a result, the classification of all systems [\eqref=a] satisfying trigonometric locus conditions leads to the same list from Theorem [\ref=th1].

The families (2),(3) in Theorem [\ref=th1] were found in [\cite=VFC] [\cite=CFV], it is the family An,1(m) from the previous section. The family (4) is new. We will denote as An - 1,2(m) the corresponding system in [formula]:

[formula]

Notice that for m = 1 this system coincides with the system An,1( - 2) from the previous section. Notice also that An - 1,2(m) is contained in the hyperplane

[formula]

which leads to a locus configuration in [formula]. In particular, for n = 2 we obtain in this way a new locus configuration in dimension 3.

Generalised WDVV equations and [formula]-systems.

The generalised WDVV (Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde) equations are the following overdetermined system of nonlinear partial differential equations:

[formula]

where Fm is the n  ×  n matrix constructed from the third partial derivatives of the unknown function [formula]:

[formula]

In this form these equations have been presented by A.Marshakov,A.Mironov and A.Morozov, who showed that the Seiberg-Witten prepotential in N = 2 four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories satisfies this system [\cite=MMM] (for more recent developments see [\cite=Mir]). Originally these equations have appeared in topological field theory, their deep geometry and relations with integrable systems were first investigated by B.A.Dubrovin in [\cite=D].

In the papers [\cite=V1],[\cite=V2] the following special class of solutions to ([\ref=wdvv]):

[formula]

where [formula] be a finite set of covectors α in the space V* dual to a vector space V, has been investigated. It was shown that ([\ref=imF]) satisfies the generalised WDVV equations if [formula] satisfies certain conditions which led to the notion of [formula]-systems.

Let us give the definition of the [formula]-systems following [\cite=V1].

Let V be a vector space (real or complex), V* be its dual, [formula] be a finite set of covectors which we assume to be non-collinear. Let's introduce the following bilinear form

[formula]

We will assume that the form [formula] is non-degenerate, in the real case this equivalent to the fact that covectors [formula] generate V*.

This means that the natural linear mapping [formula] defined by the formula

[formula]

is invertible. We will denote [formula] as [formula]. By definition

[formula]

as an operator in V* or equivalently

[formula]

for any α∈V*,v∈V.

Recall that for a pair of bilinear forms F and G on the vector space V one can define an eigenvector e as the kernel of the bilinear form F - λG for a proper λ:

[formula]

for any v∈V. When G is non-degenerate e is the eigenvector of the corresponding operator [formula]:

[formula]

Now let [formula] be as above any finite set of non-collinear covectors α∈V*, [formula] be the corresponding bilinear form ([\ref=mG]), which is assumed to be non-degenerate, [formula] are defined by ([\ref=vee]). Define now for any two-dimensional plane Π  ⊂  V* a form

[formula]

Definition. We will say that [formula] satisfies the [formula]-conditions if for any plane Π∈V* the vectors [formula] are the eigenvectors of the pair of the forms [formula] and [formula]. In this case we will call [formula] as [formula]-system.

The [formula]-conditions can be written explicitly as

[formula]

for any [formula] and some λ, which may depend on Π and α.

Geometrically we have three different cases:

1) If the plane Π contains no more than one covector from [formula] then [formula]-conditions are obviously satisfied (this means that these conditions should be checked only for a finite number of planes Π);

2) If the plane Π contains only two covectors α and β from [formula] then the condition ([\ref=expl]) means that [formula] and [formula] are orthogonal with respect to the form [formula]:

[formula]

3) If the plane Π contains more than two covectors from [formula] this condition means that [formula] and [formula] restricted to the plane [formula] are proportional:

[formula]

The [formula]-conditions are known to be sufficient (in the real case - necessary and sufficient) for F of the form ([\ref=imF]) to satisfy the generalised WDVV (see [\cite=V1],[\cite=V2]).

The natural examples of the [formula]-systems are given by the Coxeter systems consisting of the normals to the reflection hyperplanes of some Coxeter group. It turned out that the locus configurations can be used to construct non-Coxeter examples of the [formula]-systems. Namely for a given locus configuration A consisting from the vectors α in the Euclidean space V with multiplicities mα we can define a new set of vectors in V  ≈  V*

[formula]

A surprising fact discovered in [\cite=V1] is that for all locus configurations described in the section 2 the corresponding sets [formula] satisfy the [formula]-conditions. A natural question arose whether this is a common property of all locus configurations or not. Now we are ready to answer this question.

The systems [formula] corresponding to the new family of the locus configurations An,2(m) do not satisfy the [formula]-conditions. Corresponding function ([\ref=imF]) is a solution of the generalised WDVV equation only if m = 1.

To prove this let's notice that the definition of the [formula]-systems is affine invariant. This means that we can consider the projection of the corresponding system [formula] into the hyperplane xn + 2  =  0, which has the form

[formula]

A straightforward calculation shows that the [formula]-conditions corresponding to the plane containing the vectors [formula] are satisfied if and only if m = 1 when we have the configuration of the type An,1( - 2). Notice that since the system [formula] is real this implies that if m  ≠  1 the corresponding function ([\ref=imF]) does not satisfy the generalised WDVV equation according to the general result from [\cite=V2].

In analogy with the previous section, it is natural to consider [formula]-systems of A type which consist of the covectors μij(ei - ej)∈V*. Then the [formula]-conditions imply some algebraic relations on the parameters μij. In case n = 4 we are able to give the complete solution.

The system of A3-type

[formula]

satisfies the [formula]-conditions if and only if

[formula]

The corresponding family of solutions of the generalised WDVV equation has the form

[formula]

with arbitrary c1,c2,c3.

It is interesting that this family of [formula]-systems can be extended to higher dimensions, though we are not sure whether or not this exhausts all possibilities.

Namely, let us consider the system [formula] in [formula] where [formula] are arbitrary (positive) parameters. Without loss of generality, we may assume that cn + 1 = 1 and restrict the system onto hyperplane xn + 1 = 0. Thus we arrive at the following n-parametric family of configurations in [formula]:

[formula]

The system [\eqref=ch] satisfies [formula]-conditions for any [formula]. The corresponding family of solutions of the generalised WDVV equation has the form

[formula]

Let us identify [formula] with its dual using the standard Euclidean structure. Then the bilinear form [formula] associated to the system [\eqref=ch] according to the formula [\eqref=mG] looks as follows:

[formula]

The associated matrix which we will denote by the same symbol G has the form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. A straightforward check shows that its inverse has the form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] for all i,j.

To verify [formula]-conditions, we should deal with two-dimensional planes Π containing at least two of the vectors [formula]. Altogether we have the following 4 different types of such planes:

(1) Π  =  〈ei,ej,ei - ej〉;

(2) Π  =  〈ei - ej,ej - ek,ei - ek〉;

(3) Π  =  〈ei - ej,ek〉;

(4) Π  =  〈ei - ej,ek - el〉.

Let us consider the first case. Let us fix a basis in Π as α = ei and β = ej. Then the corresponding plane [formula] is spanned by [formula] and [formula]. Using the explicit formula for G- 1 one easily finds that (up to a nonessential factor)

[formula]

(with c- 1i appearing in the i-th component) and similarly

[formula]

Now we should check that the restrictions of the forms G and GΠ onto [formula] are proportional. Here GΠ is given by the formula

[formula]

After some calculations one finds that

[formula]

On the other hand, evaluating GΠ we obtain that

[formula]

This demonstrates that G and GΠ are proportional and gives [formula]-condition for the case (1).

In case (3) we take α = ei - ej, β = ek and have only to check that the Euclidean product [formula] is zero. The latter becomes obvious after calculating [formula] which is proportional to the vector c- 1iei - c- 1jej.

Two other cases are completely analogous. As a result, we conclude that the system [\eqref=ch] is a [formula]-system for any values of the parameters [formula] and the corresponding function [\eqref=imF] is a solution of the generalised WDVV equation.

When [formula] for some k < n and [formula] the system [\eqref=ch] reduces to the configuration Ak  *  Al discovered by Berest and Yakimov (see [\cite=V2]). For general ci the constructed solutions of the generalised WDVV equation seem to be new.

A natural question is what is the analogue of the family [\eqref=ch] for other classical root systems. The answer is given by the following family

[formula]

One can easily check that the [formula]-conditions are satisfied for arbitrary values of the parameters [formula]. The corresponding new solution of the generalised WDVV equation has the form

[formula]

Relation to Huygens' Principle.

Let us consider the second order hyperbolic equation

[formula]

where [formula] is the D'Alembert operator, [formula].

J.Hadamard raised the question when such an equation has the fundamental solution located on the characteristic cone, or equivalently, when it satisfyes the Huygens' Principle in the narrow Hadamard's sense. For the review of the current situation with this problem we refer to [\cite=CFV]. In particular, the theorem 6.1 from [\cite=CFV] claims that if u(x) is a real rational potential [\eqref=3] related to a locus configuration, then the equation [\eqref=wave] satisfies the Huygens' Principle for large enough odd N. More precisely, if [formula] is a potential [\eqref=3] related to a locus configuration [formula] then one should take [formula]. Converse statement is also true if we assume that all the Hadamard's coefficients are rational functions (see theorem 6.2 in [\cite=CFV]).

Applying this first for the configuration An - 1,1(m), we arrive at the following potential u depending on [formula]:

[formula]

For any [formula] the corresponding equation [\eqref=wave] will satisfy the Huygens' Principle if N is odd and N  ≥  mn(n - 1) + 2n + 3. When m is negative integer, the potential [\eqref=u1] is no longer real-valued. However, one can make a change of coordinates and think of [formula] as a t-variable. In this way we arrive at the time-dependent real potential [formula] as follows:

[formula]

and the corresponding huygensian equation [\eqref=wave] for odd N  ≥  ( - 1 - m)n(n - 1) + 2n + 3.

In case of the configuration An - 1,2(m) with [formula] one can make a similar change of coordinates and think of [formula] as a t-variable. The corresponding potential u(t,x) will be of the form

[formula]

Thus, we arrive at the following result.

The equation [formula] with the potential u(t,x) given by [\eqref=uu] with a positive integer m satisfies the Huygens' Principle for odd N  ≥  mn(n - 1) + 4n + 5.

This gives us the new examples of the huygensian equations, the first of which appears in dimension N = 17 for n = 2 and m = 2.
