Crew's Euler Characteristic Formula Fails for Nonzero Slopes

Let f:X  →  Y be a finite étale cover of separated schemes of fnite type over a field k of characteristic p > 0. If l  ≠  p, the Euler-Poincaré formula (a special case of Riemann-Hurwitz) states that [formula], where χc denotes the Euler characteristic

[formula]

with respect to étale cohomology with compact supports.

This relation fails in general for l = p, but holds in an important special case. Suppose f is a Galois cover and deg f is a power of p. Then the relation [formula] holds; for complete curves, this is due to Shafarevich [\cite=shaf], for arbitrary curves it is equivalent to the Deuring-Shafarevich formula, and in general it is due to in dimension 1 and by Crew [\cite=crew] in general.

For X and Y smooth and proper over [formula], this assertion can be reinterpreted in terms of crystalline cohomology. Namely, in this case, the crystalline cohomology groups [formula] are finitely generated modules over the Witt ring W of k with a semilinear endomorphism F (the Frobenius). For any rational number λ, we let hiλ(X) be the multiplicity of the slope λ in [formula]; then [formula]. If we put

[formula]

then Crew's theorem is that χ0(X)  =  |G|χ0(Y).

Crew asks whether χλ(X)  =  |G|χλ(Y) for other values of λ. We present an explicit counterexample to this assertion with p = 2 and dim X  =  1.

Let [formula]. Consider the curves

[formula]

and let X be the fibre product of C and D over the maps to [formula] given by x. Then X admits a map to Y given by setting w = u + v; it is easily verified that this map is étale. Furthermore, using Riemann-Hurwitz, one calculates g(C)  =  10, g(D)  =  0, g(Y)  =  11, and g(X)  =  21.

The characteristic polynomials of Frobenius on H1(C),H1(X),H1(Y) can be obtained by counting points over finite extensions of [formula]. We compute

[formula]

and PX(t)  =  PC(t)PY(t); of course PD(t)  =  1. From these polynomials we can read off the hiλ; namely, and so χλ(X)  ≠  2χλ(Y) for λ∈{3 / 7,1 / 2,4 / 7}.

The underlying phenomenon seems to be that while C is supersingular, the generic curve of the form u2 - u  =  A(x) / x21 has slopes 3 / 7 and 4 / 7 with multiplicity 7. It appears that the supersingularity of C is unstable under fiber products.
