Vortex energy and vortex bending for a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate

Introduction

Since the experimental achievement of Bose-Einstein condensates in confined alkali-metal gases in 1995, there has been a huge experimental and theoretical interest in these systems [\cite=BuR] [\cite=CD] [\cite=DGPS] [\cite=mal] [\cite=FCS] [\cite=FCS2] [\cite=MCWD2] [\cite=FS] [\cite=MCWD] [\cite=SF]. The study of vortices is one of the key issues. Two different groups have obtained vortices experimentally, the JILA group [\cite=mal] and the ENS group [\cite=MCWD2] [\cite=MCWD]. In the ENS experiment, a laser beam is imposed on the magnetic trap holding the atoms to create a harmonic anisotropic rotating potential. For sufficiently large angular velocities, vortices are detected in the system. Experimentally, the ENS group [\cite=MCWD] has observed that when the vortex is nucleated, the contrast is not 100% which means that the vortex line is not straight but bending. Numerical computations solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [\cite=C] [\cite=GP1] have shown that there is a range of velocities for which the vortex line is indeed bending. The aim of this paper is to justify these observations theoretically in the Thomas Fermi regime. We define an asymptotic parameter which is small in the Thomas Fermi regime and approximate the Gross-Pitaevskii energy to obtain a simpler form of the energy which only depends on the shape of the vortex lines. Then we check numerically that our characterization leads to solution with a bent vortex for a range of values of the rotationnal velocity which are consistent with the ones obtained numerically [\cite=C]. Let us point out that Svidzinsky and Fetter [\cite=SF2] have studied the dynamics of a vortex line depending on its curvature. For a vortex velocity equal to 0, the equation obtained in [\cite=SF2] is the same as the equation corresponding to the minimum of our approximate energy, though the formulation in [\cite=SF2] was not derived from energy considerations. Moreover, their analysis is only valid for a single vortex line.

The Gross-Pitaevskii energy provides a very good description of Bose-Einstein condensates: it is assumed that the N particles of the gas are condensed in the same state for which the wave function φ minimizes the Gross-Pitaevskii energy. In the ENS experiment, a laser is applied to the trap which makes it rotate. By introducing a rotating frame at the angular velocity [formula], the trapping potential becomes time independent, and the wave function φ minimizes the energy

[formula]

under the constraint [formula]. Here, for any complex quantities u and v and their complex conjugates ū and [formula], (u,v) = (u  +  ūv) / 2.

We want to nondimensionnalize the energy in order to get a parameter which is small in the Thomas-Fermi regime. This framework of study has been developed by one of the authors in [\cite=AD], except that [\cite=AD] was a two dimensionnal study for a condensate confined in the z axis. We define the characteristic length d = (mωx)1 / 2 and assume ωy  =  αωx, ωz  =  βωx. We set

[formula]

where g3D = 4π2a / m. For numerical applications, we are going to use the experimental values of the ENS group [\cite=C] [\cite=MCWD], m = 1.445.10- 26kg, a = 5.8.10- 11m, N = 1.4.105 and ωx = 1094s- 1 with α = 1.06, β = 0.067. We find that ε = 0.0174, thus, ε is small, which will be our asymptotic regime. We re-scale the distance by [formula] and define [formula] where [formula] and we set Ω  =    /  εωx. The velocity Ω is chosen such that Ω < 1  /  ε, that is the trapping potential is stronger than the inertial potential. The energy can be rewritten as:

[formula]

Due to the constraint [formula], we can add to E3D any multiple of [formula] so that it is equivalent to minimize

[formula]

where [formula] for some constant ρ0 to be determined. Let D be the ellipse [formula]. We impose the following constraint on [formula]:

[formula]

Indeed, as ε tends to 0, the minimizer will satisfy that |u|2 will be close to [formula] so that the constraint will be satisfied automatically by u if we impose ([\ref=cons]). In other words, [formula] is the Thomas Fermi approximation of u. Equation ([\ref=cons]) leads to

[formula]

To study the problem analytically, it is reasonable to minimize the energy over the domain D with zero boundary data for u. Indeed, when [formula], the energy is convex so that the minimizer u goes to zero exponentially at infinity (see the numerical observation in [\cite=CD] and the analysis on the behavior near the boundary of D as well as the decay at infinity of the order parameter in [\cite=DPS] [\cite=FF]). We consider the problem

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that a critical point u of [formula] is a solution of

[formula]

with u = 0 on ∂D and [formula] is the Lagrange multiplier. The specific choice of ρ0 in ([\ref=rho0]) will imply that the term [formula] is negligible in front of [formula].

We have set the framework of study of our energy. In Section 2, we will make an asymptotic development of the energy taking into account that ε is small (but [formula] is not big). Then in Section 3, we will check that our approximate energy yields a solution which is consistent with the numerical and experimental observations.

Asymptotic development of the energy

Our aim is to decouple the energy into 3 terms: a part coming from the solution without vortices, a vortex contribution and a term due to rotation.

The solution without vortices

Firstly, we are interested in solutions without vortices, that is u has no zero in the interior of D. Thus we consider functions of the form η = feiS, where η is in H10(D) and f is real and has no zero in the interior of D. We consider first minimizing [formula] over such functions without imposing the constraint that the L2 norm is 1, that is, f and S minimize

[formula]

where [formula]. We have [formula] on ∂D and

[formula]

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=S]) implies that there exists [formula] in [formula] such that

[formula]

So [formula] is the unique solution of

[formula]

In the special case where the cross section of D is a disc, the minimum of ([\ref=fSener]) is reached for [formula] but this is not the case if the cross section is an ellipse and there is a non trivial solution of ([\ref=S]). As ε tends to 0, since the ellipticity of the cross-section is small, [formula] tends to [formula] in every compact subset of D and the function [formula] given by ([\ref=xinp]) or ([\ref=xieq]) tends to the unique solution ξ of

[formula]

One can easily get that

[formula]

Using ([\ref=xinp]), we can define S0, the limit of [formula], to be the solution of [formula] with zero value at the origin. We have S0 = CΩxy with C = (α2 - 1) / (α2 + 1). We see that S0 vanishes when α = 1 that is when the cross-section is a disc. This computation is consistent with the one in [\cite=SF], though it is derived in a different way.

Decoupling the energy

Let [formula] be the vortex free minimizer of [formula] discussed previously without imposing the constraint on the norm of u. Let [formula] be a configuration that will minimize [formula] and let [formula]. Since [formula] satisfies the Gross Pitaevskii equation ([\ref=f])-([\ref=S]), we have

[formula]

Using this identity, one can get that the energy [formula] decouples as follows

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

The first term in the energy is independent of the solution [formula], so we have to compute the next two and find for which configuration [formula] the minimum is achieved. We assume that the solution [formula] has a vortex line along γ and we call [formula] the dirac measure along the line. Our aim is to estimate the energy of [formula] depending on γ. A first approximation consists in writing that [formula] tends to [formula] when ε is small so that we can approximate [formula] by [formula] and [formula] by [formula].

Estimate of [formula]

We want to estimate

[formula]

The mathematical techniques to approximate [formula] have been introduced by [\cite=BBH] in the 2 dimensionnal case and by [\cite=R] in dimension 3, when ε is very small. The problem here is that ε = 0.0174 so that [formula] is not large and there will be additional terms in the asymptotic expansion. For a minimizing configuration, one can prove that [formula] is tending to 1 everywhere except close to the vortex line γ. We define

[formula]

and assume that λε is small, λ being a nondimensionnal parameter to be fixed later on. Then we split Gε into two integrals: one in Tλε and the other in [formula].

Estimate near the vortex core

We are going to estimate [formula] in Tλε. At each point γ(t) of γ, we define Π- 1(γ(t)) to be the plane orthogonal to γ at γ(t). Since λε is small, we assume that [formula] is constant in [formula] and we call the value [formula]. We want to compute

[formula]

Since [formula] is a minimizing configuration of [formula], after scaling by [formula], we find that [formula] is very close to [formula], where u1(r,θ) = f1(r)eiθ is the solution with a single zero at the origin of

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

where

[formula]

The last approximation is good if [formula] is large (in fact bigger than 3 is enough). The existence of λ is justified by the fact that [formula] is much bigger than 1, except very close to the boundary.

The final estimate of this section is

[formula]

Estimate away from the vortex core

We are going to estimate [formula] in [formula]. In this region [formula], so that only the kinetic energy of the phase has a contribution.

[formula]

where [formula] is the phase of [formula]. Of course, [formula] is not defined everywhere. But let ψ be such that [formula] and

[formula]

Then ψ is the unique solution of

[formula]

where [formula] is the vectorial dirac measure along γ and

[formula]

where ν is the outward unit normal. We will see that ψ is almost constant at a distance λε from γ and we call this value ψλε(γ). Since the vortex line has a winding number 2π,

[formula]

We have to compute ψ on ∂Tλε. The computation is inspired by the paper of Svidzinsky and Fetter [\cite=SF2]. It follows from ([\ref=psi]) that ψ satisfies

[formula]

Let x0∈γ. We denote by [formula] and [formula] an orthogonal base in local coordinates. Then ψ has coordinates ψi in [formula] and the variations of ψ3 are the only ones of influence in the equation for ψ, since we want to compute ψ  ·  dl. We approximate the equation for ψ by

[formula]

where [formula]. Let [formula]. Then it follows from ([\ref=psi3]) that Ξ satisfies

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here [formula] is the laplacian in the plane perpendicular to [formula]. If the cross-section is a disc one can compute μ. We denote by θ the angle of [formula] that is [formula]and (r,z) are the coordinates of x0 in the original frame. Then

[formula]

Note that μ > 0. In fact our numerical computations even yield μ > 7. Our aim is now to give an approximate expression for Ξ. We locally approximate the curve γ near the point x0 by the parabola x = kz2 / 2, where k is the curvature of γ at x0. This is where we use the same ideas as in [\cite=SF2]. Note that in our approximations, we are only taking into account the shape of γ close to x0. The justification for this relies on the fact that μ > 7 as our numerics show. Indeed if we solve

[formula]

where f is supported at a distance d of x0. Then using the Green function, we find that

[formula]

In particular, for d = 0.1, this gives an error less than 10- 3. This is to be compared to the Euler constant and our approximation is reasonnable. We rewrite ([\ref=Xi]) in local coordinates to get

[formula]

where [formula] is the dirac mass supported along the line [formula]. Thus

[formula]

The solution of this equation is

[formula]

where K0 is a modified Bessel function. In particular, [formula] for small x where C0≃0.577 is the Euler constant. Hence, we deduce

[formula]

Thus we conclude by the estimate for [formula] in [formula]

[formula]

Estimate of [formula]

We want to estimate

[formula]

Recall that the unique solution of ([\ref=xieq]) satisfies [formula]. Hence we integrate by part in ([\ref=I]) to get

[formula]

Let [formula] be the phase of [formula]. Since [formula] is tending to one everywhere except on the vortex line, then [formula], hence we can approximate [formula] by [formula]. We use the value of ξ given by ([\ref=valxi]) and the fact that [formula] to get

[formula]

Final estimate for the energy

We use ([\ref=splitener])-([\ref=Gint])-([\ref=Gout])-([\ref=Iapp]) to derive the energy of a solution with a vortex line. Indeed the energy of any solution minus the energy of a solution without vortex is roughly the vortex contribution in the sense:

[formula]

We find that the vortex contribution [formula] is

[formula]

Hence if the right-hand-side of ([\ref=enerapp]) is negative, it means that it is energetically favorable to have vortices. Note that in the first integral of [formula], we have [formula] whereas in the second one, we have dz.

If the vortex line is straight, our computation yields

[formula]

This gives a critical angular velocity Ω1 for which a straight vortex has a lower energy than a vortex free solution. With our experimental data, it yields Ω1  ~  22.45, that is 1  /  ωx  ~  0.39. We are going to see in the numerical section that for Ω  <  Ω1, a bent vortex has a negative energy.

Case of several vortices

Let us assume that the solution [formula] has n vortices along the lines γi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. We want to estimate the energy in this case. For each γi, we define Ti,λε as in ([\ref=T]).

One can check that the estimates ([\ref=Iapp]) and ([\ref=Gint]), respectively for [formula] and for [formula] close to each vortex core, are unchanged if the integral along γ is replaced by the sum of the integrals along γi. The only difference is for the estimate away from the vortex cores where we have to take into account the interaction between the vortex lines. Let us denote [formula]. We still have

[formula]

where [formula] and ψi solves ([\ref=psi]) with γi instead of γ. Thus, we need to estimate

[formula]

The first integral is estimated as in section C.2 by

[formula]

As for the second integral in ([\ref=enmul]), we integrate it by part to get

[formula]

The computation of ψk(x) from section C.2 is still valid and we have [formula]. This yields the contribution of n vortex lines (to be compared with ([\ref=enerapp]) for 1 vortex)

[formula]

where K0 is a modified Bessel function. Note that the curves are going to interact only in the region where they are close to one another.

Comparison with the numerics

We are interested in the shape of the vortex line that minimizes ([\ref=enerapp]) according to the value of Ω. We write (γ(t) = r(t),z(t)) and we assume that the vortex line is in the plane (y,z). We will denote [formula] and we define

[formula]

Since ([\ref=enerapp]) does not depend on the parametrization γ(t), we choose a special parametrization on the curve such that

[formula]

Then it is equivalent to minimize

[formula]

under the constraint ([\ref=crho1]). In our computations below, we will proceed to a minimization of ([\ref=e2]) releasing the constraint ([\ref=crho1]). Indeed, computations show that ([\ref=crho1]) is true from t = 0 to t* where the shape of the vortex is determined. Under the assumption that μ and the curvature do not vary too much along the curve, we derive an equation for the minimum γ:

[formula]

Thus, we solve this system with initial conditions r(0) = r0, [formula], z(0) = 0, [formula].

We let r0 vary in order to find the minimizing solution. We have drawn the vortex line for the minimizing solution for some values of Ω in Figure [\ref=figvor]. We find that indeed the vortex line is bending for a range of Ω. The bent vortex starts to exist near the boundary of the ellipse, that is [formula], z = 0 for Ω0 = 21.2, that is 0  /  ωx = 0.368. As Ω increases, the value of r0 decreases: r0 = 0.03 for Ω = 21.8, r0 = 2.9 10- 4 for Ω = 25.8, r0 = 10- 6 for Ω = 33.1. As Ω increases, r0 becomes smaller, the bent vortex gets very close to the straight vortex. The shape of the vortex lines are similar to those obtained in [\cite=GP1] using the full Gross Pitaevskii energy.

We plot the energy of the straight vortex line and the bent vortex vs Ω in Figure [\ref=figener]. One can observe that for Ωc = 21.8, that is c  /  ωx = 0.38 in the initial units, the energy of the bent vortex starts to be negative (that is below the energy of a solution without vortex), while the energy of a straight vortex line is positive. For Ω = 33.1, the energy of the bent vortex and of a straight vortex line become equal. These results are consistent with the ones in [\cite=C]. They obtain the same value of Ωc for which the bent vortex has a negative energy.

Let us point out that the bent vortex is a minimizer even if the cross section is a disc. Nevertheless, when ε is fixed, if β gets too big, the straight vortex becomes the minimizer, which is the case for β = 1. Our analysis could give the critical value of β above which the vortex line should be straight.

We believe that our analysis justifies why in the conditions of the ENS experiment, when a vortex is nucleated, the contrast is not 100% : indeed, a bent vortex has a lower energy than a straight vortex. Nevertheless, the velocity of nucleation in the experiment is higher than our critical angular velocity Ωc: we compute the thermodynamical critical velocity whereas the velocity of nucleation is likely to be closer to the velocity where the vortex free solution loses local stability. Once the first vortex is obtained experimentally, if Ω is decreased, the bent vortex is likely to exist down to Ω0.

When there are several vortices, we were not able to find numerically the shape of the vortex lines which minimize ([\ref=enerappn]) but we believe that our simplified energy is a good description of the experiments [\cite=MCWD] and the numerics [\cite=GP1] and we hope that it can be easier to handle than the full Gross Pitaevskii energy.

Conclusion

We have obtained a simplified expression ([\ref=enerapp]) of the energy of a minimizing solution of the Gross Pitaevskii energy with a vortex line γ and ([\ref=enerappn]) for n vortex lines γi. This expression depends on the shape of the vortex line. This has allowed us to draw the vortex line for the minimizing solution and compute its energy. We have seen that there is a range of rotationnal velocities for which a bent vortex line has a lower energy than a straight vortex and a vortex free solution. These computations on the simplified expression of the energy are in agreement with the computations on the full energy [\cite=C] [\cite=GP1].
