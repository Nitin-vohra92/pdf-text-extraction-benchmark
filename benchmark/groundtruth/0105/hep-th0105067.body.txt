Delocalized membrane model

Introduction

Membrane theories [\cite=GSW] [\cite=BN] [\cite=VV] [\cite=Duff] consider membranes as mapping x from manifold [formula] of dimension n to (pseudo)Riemannian manifold [formula] of dimension D > n ("(   →   M)-approach", or "(   →   M)-theories"). The manifold [formula] is interpreted as space-time ("bulk"). The image [formula] is interpreted as membrane. Under this formulation the action of membrane theory includes terms of two types, one of which involves integration over [formula], the other involves integration over [formula]. Similarly the range of equation of motion is either [formula] or [formula]. Membrane appears in bulk equation in the form of singular sources localized at [formula]. The goal of the present paper is to provide a covariant method of regularization of closed membrane theories.

To regularize these singularities one has to replace fields defined at [formula] by some bulk fields. The procedure of regularization can be considered as replacement of common membrane, which has zero thickness by some sort of thick membrane, which corresponds to continuous distribution of infinitely light membranes.

The approach presented in the paper ("(   →   F)-approach") replaces mapping x:   →   M by mapping φ:   →   F, where [formula] is a manifold of dimension D - n. If for some point [formula] inverse image φ- 1(φ) is submanifold of dimension n, then it has to be considered as infinitely light membrane. The generalization of p-brane solution with delocalized membranes is presented in section [\ref=p-b-sec] as an example of (   →   F)-approach.

In comparison with (   →   M)-theories in (   →   F)-approach the number of fields used to describe membrane is reduced from D to D - n. This reduction eliminates n constraints of (   →   M)-theories. (   →   F)-approach action has no constraints. It allows us to find Hamiltonian formulation of theory in straightforward way in section [\ref=Ham-sec].

(   →   F)-approach is natural to represent continious distribution of membranes. Representation of Nambu-Goto type action in terms of set of scalar fields was initially suggested in papers [\cite=hos1] [\cite=hos2] [\cite=hos3]. In [\cite=morris1] [\cite=morris2] [\cite=morris3] the action was adopted to description of single membrane by insertion of delta-function. Invariance of equations of motion under coordinate transformation on [formula] was demonstrated in papers [\cite=bf1] [\cite=bf2]. [\cite=bf1] [\cite=bf2] introduced alternative interpretation of the same (   →   F)-action. The action presented in the current paper is invariant under coordinate transformations on both [formula] and [formula]. Equations of motion for free delocolized membrane follow from energy-momentum conservation, meanwhile the form of energy-momentum tensor is determined by projective property. A generalization of p-brane solution is presented as an example of delocalized membrane interacting with closed (n + 1)-form.

Notation

D-dimensional space time, i.e. smooth (pseudo)Riemannian manifold [formula] with metric ds2 = gMNdXMdXN, [formula] is considered. Small latin indices are used for space coordinates [formula]. In further calculations [formula] is considered to be a finite region in [formula] with smooth boundary [formula].

For differential forms A and B with components [formula] and [formula] the following tensor is introduced

[formula]

Index (k) indicates the number of indices to contract. If it can not lead to ambiguity, (k) is skipped.

For differential form of power q it is convenient to introduce a norm [formula] and Hodge duality operation * A = (Ω,A)(q), where [formula] is form of volume. Here and below g =  det (gMN).

For set of differential forms Ak, numerated by index [formula] the object [formula] is defined by the following

[formula]

Objects defined on manifold other then M bear additional index, the name of manifold.

Projective properties of energy-momentum tensor

As a key property of membrane to reproduce, one has to choose a property, which can be written in terms of D-dimensional objects and has a simple geometrical meaning. It is natural to consider as the key property the following form of energy-momentum tensor TMN

[formula]

where ρ is tension in the direction specified by n-dimensional (PM~  ~ M = n) orthogonal projector PM~  ~ N (or tension). We refer the property ([\ref=TLP]) as projective property of energy-momentum tensor.

Delocalization of membrane action

The standard action for free membrane is defined as the world surface area. Integral is taken over the membrane world surface, i.e. along a manifold [formula] of dimension 0 < n < D, meanwhile membrane geometry is described by fields xM(ξ), which define a map x:   →   M.

Generalizing standard free membrane action it is possible to introduce an action for delocalized membrane, defined by fields xM(φ,ξ), which define a map x:   ×   V   →   M, meanwhile the integral is taken along D-dimensional manifold    ×   V

[formula]

where γ  =   det (γij), γij = gMN(x(φ,ξ)) ~ ∂ixM  ~  ∂jxN, [formula], [formula] is (pseudo)Riemannian manifold with metric [formula].

Similar to the case of standard membrane action, energy-momentum tensor satisfies projective property ([\ref=TLP]), where -  ρ is equal to Lagrangian bulk density.

Equations of motion for action ([\ref=actFxV2M]) are calculated by variation by xM(φ,ξ) and coincide with free membrane equations of motion

[formula]

γij is matrix inverse to γij.

There are n constraints, like in the case of standard membrane

[formula]

So, in the case xM(φ,ξ) = xM(ξ) the model with action ([\ref=actFxV2M]) reproduces standard free membrane with tension [formula].

The fields xM(φ,ξ), describing delocalized membrane, define a map of D-dimensional manifold    ×   V to another D-dimensional manifold [formula]. The case of special interest is the case then the map x is a (local) diffeomorphism, i.e. [formula]. At that time fields xM in action ([\ref=actFxV2M]) specify some coordinate transformation on the manifold    ×   V. Equation xM(φ,ξ) = XM can be solved with respect to φ and ξ, which become functions of coordinates XM: φα  =  φα(X), ξi  =  ξi(X). Letters from the beginning of Greek alphabet numerate coordinates φα on the manifold [formula]. Action ([\ref=actFxV2M]) can be rewritten in terms of fields φα(X) and ξi(X) as integral over coordinates XM. Action written in this form (see below) does not involve fields ξi(X), i.e. it solves the constraints ([\ref=svqzi]).

Field [formula] with components φα(xM(φ,ξ)) = φα is referred as membrane field, its components φα are referred as membrane potentials. Here [formula] is some (D - n)-dimensional (pseudo)Riemannian manifold with metric [formula].

Membrane field

Membrane field intensity is defined as differential form of power D - n of the following form

[formula]

[formula] is a function of φ, so the form J is closed. Under coordinate transformations on [formula] [formula] transforms like determinant of (pseudo)metric on [formula]. Identity dJ = 0 is natural to refer as kinematical conservation law.

In further calculations we need also unit normal [formula], and unit tangent u =  * n.

Action is defined by formula

[formula]

Action ([\ref=actM2F-J]) is invariant under general coordinate transformation at [formula] and [formula]. The following condition is also required [formula].

Action ([\ref=actM2F-J]) (in the case [formula]) was introduces for n = 2 in papers [\cite=hos1] [\cite=hos2] [\cite=hos3] as action for string. In papers [\cite=bf1] [\cite=bf2] the same action for arbitrary D and n was considered as action for (D - n)-dimensional membrane.

By variation of action ([\ref=actM2F-J]) over membrane potential φα one finds equations of motion

[formula]

In formula ([\ref=eom-n]) factor under hat is skipped.

By variation of action ([\ref=actM2F-J]) over metric in space [formula] one can find energy-momentum tensor

[formula]

where projector is defined as PMN = gMN - (n,n)MN. So, energy-momentum tensor satisfies projective property ([\ref=TLP]). Tr = n, so action ([\ref=actM2F-J]) has to be considered as action for n-dimensional membrane. In [\cite=bf1] [\cite=bf2] this action was considered as action for (D - n)-dimensional membrane.

Equations of motion ([\ref=eom-n]) follow from energy-momentum conservation and can be written as δn = 0, where δ =  * - 1d * .

In is useful to mention also the following interesting property of action ([\ref=actM2F-J]), equations of motion do not depend upon metric on manifold [formula], which can affect only set of acceptable fields J.

Theorem. If membrane field intensity J is spacelike, i.e. [formula], field φ(X) and metric gMN(X) are continuously differentiable two times, then equations of motion ([\ref=eom-n]) are equivalent to equations of motion ([\ref=eom-X]), which are specified at all submanifolds φ = const.

So, action ([\ref=actFxV2M]) and action ([\ref=actM2F-J]) have the same energy-momentum tensors and equivalent equations of motion.

In all formulae above, finiteness of [formula] and [formula], was suggested, nevertheless, because equations of motion of membrane field have the form δn = 0, one can define equations of motion at the points, where unit normal has a limit.

Moreover, solutions of equations of motion are transformed to solutions under the replacement of field φα(X) by ψ(φα(X)), where function ψ is monotone and continuously differentiable two times. Nevertheless, ambiguity of equations of motion let us postulate the same property for non-monotone functions ψ. So, if in some region of [formula] J = 0, then, it is natural to believe, that there is no field in this region, and equations of motion are satisfied identically.

One can conclude, the action ([\ref=actFxV2M]) and action ([\ref=actM2F-J]) are equivalent not only in the case then [formula], but also in more general class of situations. If [formula], then the standard membrane [formula] of unit tension defined as [formula] ([formula]) can be written in terms of field φ by the following way

[formula]

Substituting fields ([\ref=theta]) into action ([\ref=actM2F-J]) we find

[formula]

This action was introduces in papers [\cite=morris1] [\cite=morris2] [\cite=morris3] as action for regular (non-delocalized) membrane.

Hamiltonian formulation

The action ([\ref=actM2F-J]) has no constraints. It allows us to find Hamiltonian formulation of theory in straightforward way.

Instead of (D - n)-form J one can introduce (D - n)  ×  (D - n) matrix

[formula]

Let Gαβ be a matrix inverse to Gαβ, and G  =   det (Gαβ).

The action ([\ref=actM2F-J]) can be written in the following equivalent form

[formula]

Equations of motion ([\ref=eom-n]) and energy-momentum tensor ([\ref=emt]) in terms of G acquire the form

[formula]

Momenta conjugated to fields φα are

[formula]

In terms of momenta

[formula]

[formula]

Here

[formula]

is matrix inverse to space metric hmn = gmn,

[formula]

Using the formulae above, we write the Hamiltonian density

[formula]

In Minkowski space-time, [formula], Hamiltonian has the form

[formula]

p-brane solution with delocalized source

As an example, let us consider solution of Einstein equations in the presence of field of antisymmetric tensor of power q and membrane field interacting with the antisymmetric tensor. The solution presented generalizes p-brane solution in supergravity type model.

Let us consider action

[formula]

where F = dA, A is differential form of power q, [formula], [formula].

By variation over fields gMN, [formula], φα one finds the following equations of motion

[formula]

[formula]

The fields defined by the following equations solve the equations of motion

[formula]

[formula]

Here H is smooth positive function of space coordinates Xα, [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]. Calculating [formula] one has to choose a branch of square root, which gives [formula].

In special case D = 4, q = 1 the solution above generalizes Madjumdar-Papapetru solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations for the case of the source, which is dust cloud with charge density equal to mass density.

Similar to above generalization of p-brane solution, analogous generalizations of intersecting extremal p-brane solutions were found. (on intersecting p-brane solutions see [\cite=AIR] [\cite=IM] and references in these papers). These solutions are not presented in the article because of large volume of formulae, necessary to formulate the result in general case.
