More on Tanaka-Tagoshi Parametrization of post-1PN Spin-Free Gravitational Wave Chirps: Equispaced and Cardinal Interpolated Lattices

In a recent paper [\cite=TaTa] we shew that the spin-free gravitational wave templates parametrization introduced by Tanaka and Tagoshi in [\cite=TaTa1] is effective to set up uniformly spaced post-1PN template lattices subject to a given minimal match constraint. Lattice-uniformity makes cardinal interpolation of the match [\cite=card1], [\cite=card2] in the 2D Tagoshi-Tanaka parameter space straightforward, yielding a reduction in the 2PN template density and total number by a factor ~  4 at Γ = 0.97.

In [\cite=TaTa] the 2PN approximant of the (spectral, spin-free) chirp phase has been used. On the other hand, in [\cite=TaTa1] the 2.5PN phase (originated in [\cite=Blanchet]) has been used, which contains (besides an irrelevant f-independent term, which is absorbed in the unknown coalescency phase φC) the additional term:

where η = m1m2 / m2 is the symmetric mass-ratio, and f0 is a suitable scaling frequency [\cite=irrelevant_scaling]. It has been pointed out [\cite=Blanchet] that the 2.5PN phase agrees, in the limit η  →  0, with the one obtained by Tagoshi and Sasaki in the (perturbative) test mass-limit solution of the spin-free relativistic two-body problem [\cite=test_mass]. While this might be a good reason to include the 2.5PN term ([\ref=eq:logterm]) in the template phase, it does not result into better overlaps with exact (numerically computed) waveforms. Indeed, as shown in [\cite=DamIyeSat], 2.5PN templates yield generally poorer overlaps (and larger biases) as compared to 2PN, in view of the peculiar (oscillating) behaviour of standard PN approximants [\cite=DamIyeSat].

However, the conceptual question is posed whether the results in [\cite=TaTa] still hold if the 2.5PN logarithmic term ([\ref=eq:logterm]) is included in the template phase. The purpose of this note is to show that the main conclusions in [\cite=TaTa] do apply in this case too, though a number of differences are noted, which are summarized below.

The major difference, after the inclusion of the 2.5PN logarithmic term ([\ref=eq:logterm]) in the phase, is a moderate increase in the area of the Tanaka-Tagoshi (flattened) manifold T, yielding a correspondingly larger number of templates, as seen by comparing Fig. 1 and Table I of this note to Fig. 3 and Table III of [\cite=TaTa], respectively.

The gaussian curvature of the spin-free manifold retains the same order of magnitude, as seen by comparing Fig. 2 of this note to Fig.s 1 and 2 of [\cite=TaTa].

The main relevant conclusions in [\cite=TaTa] do not change. As shown in [\cite=TaTa], the minimal match degradation due to using the (flattened) Tanaka-Tagoshi (spin-free) parameter-space manifold in place of the (curved) true one, can be gauged in terms of the quantity η defined in Eq. (III.6 ) of [\cite=TaTa]. Even using the 2.5PN phase, the quantity η is still of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding one computed in [\cite=TaTa]. This is seen by comparing Fig. 3 of this note to Fig.s 5 and 6 of [\cite=TaTa].
