ABSTRACT

The estimation of the cosmological constant in inflationary Brane New World models is done. It is shown that basically it is quite large, of the same order as in anomaly-driven inflation. However, for some fine-tuning of bulk gravitational constant and AdS scale parameter l2 it maybe reduced to sufficiently small value. Bulk higher derivative AdS gravity with quantum brane matter may also serve as the model where small positive cosmological constant occurs.

Keywords: cosmological constant, brane-world, quantum gravity.

PACS: 04.65.+e,04.70.-s

Introduction.

It is a quite well-known fact that energy density of the vacuum appears in Einstein equations in the form of an effective cosmological constant. In other words, vacuum (or vacuum polarization) induces the effective cosmological constant which curves the observable 4d world. Roughly speaking, 4d curvature is of the order of the square root from the cosmological constant which should include not only vacuum contribution but also other (dark?) matter contributions. According to recent observations (for a review and list of references, see [\cite=C] [\cite=W]) the cosmological constant is positive and small. It is interesting that positive small cosmological constant is not what is expected from string theory. Nevertheless, there are some suggestions how to get small cosmological constant within string theory (see for example, refs.[\cite=McI] [\cite=CL] what maybe related with wormholes or spacetime foam [\cite=R]).

The fundamental question in cosmology is why the observable cosmological constant is so small? QFT considerations predict quite large vacuum energy and hence, quite large cosmological constant. Of course, it could be that the cosmological constant at very early Universe was large. However, due to some dynamical mechanism (supersymmetry? orbifold compactification?) it was reduced to the current small value. It would be interesting to understand the role of quantum effects as concerns to cosmological constant in brane-world physics. In the present work we discuss the cosmological constant value which appears in Brane New World suggested in refs.[\cite=HHR] [\cite=NOplb]. Brane New World scenario represents quantum (or AdS/CFT induced) generalization of Randall-Sundrum Universe [\cite=RS] where brane quantum fields are taken into account. It is interesting that quantum-induced brane inflation [\cite=HHR] [\cite=NOplb] (for related works, see [\cite=other]) occurs in the analogy with trace-anomaly driven inflation [\cite=sta].

Quantum-corrected cosmological constant

We start from the FRW-universe equation of motion with quantum corrections (taking into account conformal anomaly-induced effective action). Such quantum-corrected FRW-equation has the form [\cite=NO]:

[formula]

where V is the spatial volume of the universe, ã =  - 8b' (a normalization choice [\cite=NO]), b'' = 0, b is not necessary in the subsequent analysis and

[formula]

Here N, N1 / 2, N1, NHD are the number of scalars, (Dirac) spinors, vectors and higher derivative conformal scalars which are present in conformal QFT filling the Universe. The quantity N2 denotes the contribution to conformal anomaly from a spin-2 field (Einstein gravity) and NW the contribution from higher-derivative Weyl gravity. As usually, the quantum corrections produce an effective cosmological constant.

In the absence of classical matter energy (E = 0), the general FRW equation allows the quantum-induced de Sitter space solution (anomaly-driven inflation [\cite=sta]):

[formula]

where A is a constant and [formula]. It is evident then that the effective cosmological constant is defined as follows

[formula]

If b' is of order unity (what is typical in Standard Model) , we find

[formula]

It is quite large.

The natural question now is: what happens for similar inflationary brane-world scenario? Following the approach of ref.[\cite=SV] in [\cite=NObr], the quantum-corrected FRW-type equation was considered as it is predicted by inflationary brane universe in the bulk Schwarzschild-AdS5 spacetime:

[formula]

Here G5 is 5d Newton constant and V3 is the volume of the unit 3 sphere. The quantum-corrected FRW type equation looks as [\cite=NObr]

[formula]

Here 4d Newton constant G is given by

[formula]

When M = 0, the above equation ([\ref=e10]) has a solution of the form ([\ref=od2]) if [formula] and

[formula]

For negative b' ([\ref=dS3]) has a unique solution. The solution is nothing but the de Sitter brane solution in [\cite=HHR] [\cite=NOplb]. Eq.([\ref=dS3]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

Here

[formula]

Then the effective cosmological constant is given by

[formula]

If |β|  ≫  1, a solution of ([\ref=cscn01]) is given by

[formula]

and one gets

[formula]

which is different from ([\ref=cscn1]) by factor two but there is no qualitative difference. On the other hand, if |β|  ≪  1, a solution of ([\ref=cscn01]) is given by

[formula]

and we find

[formula]

Since |β|  ≪  1 means l3  ≫  G5 or l2  ≫  G, the effective cosmological constant Λeff can be small in this case. Note that one can write other solutions for effective cosmological constant from above cubic equation. However, in most cases it is getting very large.

Motivated by AdS/CFT correspondence (for a review, see[\cite=AdS]), we may consider N = 4 SU(N) SYM theory on the brane. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

In the large N limit, we have

[formula]

Then by numerical solving ([\ref=cscn01]), one finds

[formula]

In this case [formula] again. Hence, for decreasing the cosmological constant one has to consider QFT which is not exactly conformally invariant (for a recent AdS/CFT discussion of such theories, see [\cite=MPV]). From another point, one may take the arbitrary bulk values for AdS parameter and five-dimensional gravitational constant in order to achieve the smallness of the cosmological constant. The drawback of this is evident: it is kind of fine-tuning.

If we include quantum bulk scalar or spinor , they induce the Casimir effect in orbifold compactification. The corresponding vacuum energy which may stabilize the radius was found in [\cite=NOZcs] [\cite=casimir]. In the Euclidean signature, de Sitter space is expressed as the sphere. In [\cite=NOZcs], the Casimir effect makes the radius smaller or larger, especially the conformal scalar in the bulk makes the radius small and time-dependent. In Minkowski signature, the inverse of the radius corresponds to the expansion rate (i.e. B) of the universe. Then from Eq.([\ref=cscn2]), the conformal scalar in the bulk increases the effective cosmological constant. Note, however, that taking into account the bulk quantum gravity with 5d cosmological constant may presumably help in resolution of the problem. Unfortunately, the corresponding calculation is quite complicated and it is not done so far.

One may consider 5d R2 gravity, whose action is given by:

[formula]

and the brane with quantum matter corrections as in the previous case. When c = 0, the net effects can be absorbed into the redefinition of the Newton constant and the length scale l of the AdS5 [\cite=NOOr2], given by

[formula]

Then assuming the brane solution as in ([\ref=od2]) ( Brane New World in higher derivative gravity), one obtains the analogue of ([\ref=dS3]) from corresponding FRW-equation

[formula]

Furthermore if we replace G in ([\ref=e12]) by

[formula]

the arguments from ([\ref=cscn3]) to ([\ref=cscn6]) are valid. In other words, using hidden parameters of bulk higher derivative terms one can obtain the 4d cosmological constant to be reasonably small. This picture maybe generalized for the case of non-zero c, however, the corresponding equation for cosmological constant is more complicated. Nevertheless, the qualitative conclusions will be the same.

Discussion

In summary, we considered the effective cosmological constant in Brane New World induced by quantum brane matter effects. Rough estimation for inflationary brane indicates that in most cases the cosmological constant is quite large. Fine-tuning of bulk 5d gravitational and 5d cosmological constant may sometimes lead to significant decrease of 4d cosmological constant. Of course, one can imagine the situation that large cosmological constant at the beginning of inflationary era is reduced to current small value by some mechanism in course of evolution. Nevertheless, it looks that New Brane World scenario by itself cannot suggest a natural way to solve the cosmological constant problem.
