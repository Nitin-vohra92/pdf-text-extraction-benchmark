Links with surgery yielding the 3-sphere

Introduction

In [\cite=GL], Gordon and Luecke showed that non-trivial Dehn surgery on a non-trivial knot in the 3-sphere S3 never yield S3, and this led to the affirmative solution of the knot complement conjecture. On the other hand, there are abundant examples of links that admit non-trivial surgeries yielding S3. For example, if a link has an unknotted componet, then 1 / n-surgery along the component does not change the total space S3 for any n. Also, if there are two componets which cobound an annulus disjoint from the other components of the link, then a suitable surgery along those two components, corresponding to a Dehn twist along the annulus, gives S3 again. In [\cite=B], Berge gave a tunnel number one, hyperbolic link of two components which admits three non-trivial surgeries yielding S3 and whose componets are distinct hyperbolic knots. Kawauchi [\cite=K] also announced the existence of such links shown by his imitation theory. The purpose of this paper is to give links with any number of components which admit non-trivial surgery yielding S3 and whose components are mutually distinct hyperbolic knots by using Kirby calculus. (See [\cite=GS] [\cite=R] for Kirby calculus.) In particular, in case of two components, our links can be chosen to be tunnel number one and hyperbolic. (Our examples are different from Berge's one.)

Let [formula] be a link of n components. For [formula], where γi is a slope on ∂N(Ki), we use L(γ) (or [formula]) to denote the closed manifold obtained by γ-surgery on L. More precisely, L(γ) is obtained by attaching n solid tori [formula] to [formula] along their boundaries so that each γi bounds a meridian disk in Vi. In this paper, we say that the surgery is non-trivial if all γi are non-meridional slopes.

For any n  ≥  2, there exist infinitely many links [formula] of n components in S3 satisfying the following:

L admits a non-trivial surgery yielding S3;

all Ki are mutually distinct hyperbolic knots;

L is unsplittable;

L has tunnel number n - 1.

In particular, when n = 2, L can be chosen to be hyperbolic.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

Let n  ≥  2 and k  ≥  0 be integers. Let K1 be the figure-eight knot, and let [formula], where [formula] are meridians of K1. Assign an orientation to Ki as in Figure [\ref=start].

[formula].

Perform ( - 1)-twists on [formula], and change K1 to an unknot by using K2. Then the resulting framed link is a Hopf link whose coefficients are 0 and 2. It is well known that this presents S3.

Now, slide [formula] over K1. More precisely, take a parallel copy [formula] of K1 determining the framing on K1 for [formula], and form a band-sum of Ki and [formula] as shown in Figure [\ref=slide], where the band connecting Ki and [formula] has i + k full twists (right-handed). Since Ki and K1 have linking number 1, the resulting component, called Ki again, has coefficient n if i = 2, or n + 1 if i > 2.

This new link is also called L, and we now show that L has the desired properties. By Lemma [\ref=base], [formula]. It is straightforward to check that Ki is the 2-bridge knot S(1 + 20(i + k),2 - 10(i + k)). Thus all Ki are mutually distinct hyperbolic knots. Since Ki (i  ≥  2) and K1 have linking number n - 1, L is unsplittable. It is easy to see that the arcs [formula] shown in Figure [\ref=slide] form an unknotting tunnel system of L. Finally, two different values of k give distinct links.

When n = 2, our link L is tunnel number one. Since each component of L is hyperbolic 2-bridge knot, S3 - L is atoroidal by [\cite=EU] and not Seifert fibered by [\cite=BM]. Hence L is hyperbolic by [\cite=Th].

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

Even if n > 2, our link L seems to be hyperbolic, but we could not prove it.
