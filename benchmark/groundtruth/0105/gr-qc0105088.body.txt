Abstract:

Non-invariant solutions of the Boyer-Finley equation determine exact solutions of the Einstein field equations with only one rotational Killing vector. For the case of Euclidean signature such a metric was constructed by Calderbank and Tod. Recently Martina, Sheftel and Winternitz applied the method of group foliation to the Boyer-Finley equation and reproduced the Calderbank-Tod solution together with new solutions. We point out that in the case of ultra-hyperbolic signature there exist three inequivalent forms of metric. Only one of these can be obtained by analytic continuation from the Calderbank-Tod solution whereas the other two are new.

Introduction

The antecedent of Einstein field equations with Euclidean signature is the complex elliptic Monge-Ampère equation, CMA2. For elliptic CMA2 solutions determine hyper-Kähler, self-dual and therefore Ricci-flat metrics with Euclidean signature. We shall consider a symmetry reduction of CMA2 to solutions that admit only a single Killing vector. Systematic studies of vacuum metrics with one Killing vector [\cite=bw] showed that they fall into two classes depending on whether the Killing vector is translational, or rotational. In the first case we have Gibbons-Hawking metrics [\cite=gibh] where the Einstein field equations reduce to Laplace's equation, whereas in the latter it is the Boyer-Finley equation [\cite=fp] [\cite=bf]. In both cases the 2-form derived from the derivative of the Killing vector is self-dual [\cite=bf] [\cite=gh0] [\cite=gr] [\cite=tw]. We refer to [\cite=klnt] and [\cite=bfp] for the H-space context of these solutions. Until recently solutions of the Boyer-Finley equation discussed in the literature consisted of invariant solutions [\cite=ward], i.e. these solutions were invariant with respect to one-parameter symmetry subgroups of the Boyer-Finley equation itself. This symmetry carries over into the metric in the form of extra Killing vectors. We shall be interested in metrics derived from non-invariant solutions of the Boyer-Finley equation which will not possess any new symmetries. For the case of Euclidean signature only one non-invariant solution of the Boyer-Finley equation, due to Calderbank and Tod [\cite=ct], is known. Recently Martina, Sheftel and Winternitz [\cite=msw] applied the method of group foliation to the Boyer-Finley equation and obtained new non-invariant solutions. In this framework the Calderbank-Tod solution emerges naturally. We point out that for the case of ultra-hyperbolic signature there exist three inequivalent classes of solutions. Only one of them can be obtained by analytic continuation from the Calderbank-Tod solution and the other two are new.

In section [\ref=sec:heavmetric] we shall briefly recall the reduction of CMA2 to Boyer-Finley equation. We shall also discuss the Calderbank-Tod hyper-Kähler metrics with one rotational Killing vector. New metrics generated by non-invariant solutions of the Boyer-Finley equation with ultra-hyperbolic signature will be presented in section [\ref=sec:ultra].

Solutions with Euclidean signature

We consider a two dimensional complex manifold endowed with a Kähler metric

[formula]

satisfying elliptic CMA2

[formula]

so that we are dealing with a Ricci-flat metric and the Riemann curvature (1,1)-form is self-dual. This equation is also referred to as Plebanski's first heavenly equation [\cite=pleb]. We shall be interested in solutions of ([\ref=cma]) invariant under rotations where

[formula]

is the generator. If we introduce the polar radius ρ and the angle ω in the complex z1-plane

[formula]

then the Killing vector ([\ref=rotgen]) becomes X = ∂ω, the generator of rotations on the z1-plane. Henceforth we shall refer to z2 as simply z. Then the symmetry reduction of CMA2 ([\ref=cma]) results in

[formula]

where ξ  =  2 ln (ρ  /  2). But now the metric ([\ref=kahler]) assumes a complicated form

[formula]

and in order to simplify it further we apply the Legendre transformation

[formula]

whereby the reduced equation determining rotationally invariant solutions of CMA2 becomes the potential Boyer-Finley equation φz  +  φppe-  φp  =  0, or by introducing

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

the Boyer-Finley equation [\cite=bf] proper. This equation is also known as the heavenly equation and recently it has also been studied under the name SU∞-Toda equation [\cite=toda] [\cite=mart]. After the Legendre transformation ([\ref=legendre]) the Kähler metric becomes

[formula]

where τ  =  2ω. In this form of the metric we can check directly that ([\ref=heaven+]) is the only field equation that determines self-dual rotationally invariant solutions of the Einstein equations with Euclidean signature. Existence of solutions was discussed recently [\cite=feix].

Finally, we note that to check whether or not a solution of the heavenly equation reduces to the Gibbons-Hawking class we need to find the curvature of the 3-metric dl2. If it is flat, then the solution belongs to the Gibbons-Hawking class.

The Calderbank-Tod solution [\cite=ct] [\cite=msw] which is a non-invariant solution of the Boyer-Finley equation is given by

[formula]

where a and b are arbitrary holomorphic functions, one of which can be removed by a conformal symmetry transformation. Accordingly we can specialize either a, or b, or some combination of these holomorphic functions to be z. This is a matter that should be decided depending on the physical problem at hand. Then we obtain one representative for each orbit of these solutions with respect to the conformal group and the choice of the remaining arbitrary holomorphic function specifies the particular orbit. The Calderbank-Tod metric resulting from ([\ref=sol+]) is given by

[formula]

with

[formula]

where prime denotes derivative with respect to argument. We have already pointed out that there is only one essential arbitrary holomorphic function here. Furthermore, the choice of the remaining holomorphic function that will pick out interesting solutions in the family ([\ref=sol+]) is not completely arbitrary. For some holomorphic functions the solution of the heavenly equation will reduce to an invariant solution which will introduce extra Killing vectors in the metric. The complete list of possible choices for the arbitrary functions that result in invariant solutions can be found in [\cite=msw].

For purposes of physical interpretation the choice b  =  z is an interesting case. First of all, in the generic case of an arbitrary holomorphic function a the solution will be non-invariant. Then expressing the independent complex variable by stereographic projection

[formula]

([\ref=sphere]) and ([\ref=monopole]) become

[formula]

the metric on the 2-sphere and the magnetic monopole potential 1-form. For the simplest choice a = 0 in this category, the metric reduces to a Gibbons-Hawking metric with [formula] where p assumes the role of a radial coordinate.

Finally, checking the Riemann curvature tensor for the 3-metric ([\ref=3metric]) in ([\ref=metrsol+]) we find that its curvature does not vanish which is an alternative statement of the fact that the Killing vector is rotational. The full metric ([\ref=metrsol+]) has curvature singularities at

[formula]

which in the latter case includes branch cuts. The singularities of the Riemann tensor coincide with the boundaries of the domain of existence of the solution ([\ref=sol+]) and there exists no singularities inside the domain. For the choice b = z the singularity at b' = 0 is absent.

Metrics with ultra-hyperbolic signature

Euclidean metrics with self-dual curvature do not admit Lorentzian sections and this is reflected by well-known obstacles that CMA2 presents to analytic continuation because it is the equation that replaces Laplace's equation for functions of two complex variables. This property is inherited by the Boyer-Finley equation. We can however construct metrics with ultra-hyperbolic signature and there are alternative ways of arriving at such metrics starting with ([\ref=heavmetr+]). Simplest choice is

[formula]

where the only Killing vector is a null boost instead of rotation. We shall present the alternative choices later. In this version we keep z as a complex coordinate. The Einstein field equations are now given by

[formula]

which is hyperbolic version of the Boyer-Finley equation. It is the reduced equation obtained by Legendre transformation from hyperbolic CMA2 which carries minus one on the right hand side of ([\ref=cma]).

The non-invariant solution of the hyperbolic Boyer-Finley equation ([\ref=heaven-]) analogous to ([\ref=sol+]) is given by [\cite=msw]

[formula]

and the resulting metric with ultra-hyperbolic signature becomes

[formula]

where once again one of these holomorphic functions can be removed by a conformal transformation. We note that the 2-sphere metric ([\ref=sphere]) in ([\ref=metrsol+]) is now replaced by the metric for the Poincaré upper half plane with constant negative curvature in ([\ref=metrsol-]). This is immediate from the choice b = z,  a = a(z). The singularity structure of this solution is precisely the same as in ([\ref=sing]).

An alternative form of the solution with ultra-relativistic signature is obtained by regarding z, as real null coordinates u,v. Then there are two further inequivalent metrics. The first one is given by

[formula]

where a = a(u),b = b(v) and f = f(u),g = g(v) replacing the holomorphic functions a and b respectively. Next we have the metric that is directly obtainable by analytic continuation from the Calderbank-Tod solution

[formula]

where again a = a(u),b = b(v) and f = f(u),g = g(v). In these cases the curvature singularities are at

[formula]

analogous to ([\ref=sing]).

Conclusion

We have discussed solutions of the Einstein field equations with Euclidean, or ultra-hyperbolic signature that admit only one rotational Killing vector. The first non-trivial example with Euclidean signature is the Calderbank-Tod metrics because ([\ref=sol+]) is a non-invariant solution of the elliptic Boyer-Finley equation. We have used the results of Martina, Sheftel and Winternitz on the group foliation of the Boyer-Finley equation to construct new metrics with ultra-hyperbolic signature. We found that there are three inequivalent classes of such solutions only one of which is manifestly derivable from the Calderbank-Tod metric by analytic continuation. The singularity in the Riemann tensor of these solutions is in accordance with the general properties of metrics admitting a rotational Killing vector [\cite=feix].
