Representation of Joint Measurement in Quantum Mechanics A Refutation of Quantum Teleportation

Introduction

In Quantum Mechanics, the physically meaningful operators are hermitian operators, that is, operators having only real eigenvalues, this because a measurement performed on a single system is always observed as a real number. However, when two measurements are respectively performed on two distinct parts of a whole system, the result of such a joint measurement can no longer consist in a single real number, but in a couple of real numbers (a,b) instead, a and b being the results of the measurements respectively performed on the first and second subsystems. Yet a joint measurement is represented in Quantum Mechanics by a tensor product observable, so that because of the linearity of tensor product Hilbert spaces, the eigenvalue attached to one of its eigenvectors is a single real c, the computed value of the product ab. The point is that the factorisation of a real c into a product ab is not unique, so that two physically distinct eigenvectors can happen to have the same eigenvalue c. It will be shown in this article that this correlation degeneracy leads to an inconsistency within Quantum Mechanics, as soon as joint measurements are involved on entangled states. In particular it will be shown that the concept of quantum teleportation originates in this inconsistency.

Eigenvectors and eigenvalues of tensor product observables

Let S be a physical system constituted of two distinct subsystems S1 and S2. These subsystems are brought arbitrarily far from each others. Let H1 and H2 be the Hilbert spaces associated with subsystem S1 and S2 respectively, so that the whole system S is represented within the tensor product space [formula].

A measurement of a variable A, represented in Quantum Mechanics by an observable Â, is to be performed on subsystem S1, while a measurement of a variable B, represented by an observable B̂, is to be performed on subsystem S2. The observables Â and B̂ have both a non degenerated spectrum as:

[formula]

and

[formula]

The Hilbert spaces H1 and H2 are respectively span by the sets of eigenvectors {|ui〉} and {|vj〉}, and H is thus spanned by the set of tensor products of these eigenvectors [formula].

The tensor product of these observables [formula] is axiomatically defined (see Cohen-Tannoudji et al [\cite=ctdl1]) as

[formula]

where [formula] is any vector of the tensor product Hilbert space H. This axiomatic definition implies straightforwardly[\cite=ctdl1] that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are respectively the identity operators of H1 and H1, which means that the tensor product of observables [formula] is explicitly equivalent to a product of commuting tensor product observables, the first one [formula] meaning that a measurement represented by Â is performed on subsystem S1, leaving subsystem S2 unchanged, and the second one [formula] meaning that a measurement represented by B̂ is performed on subsystem S2, leaving subsystem S1 unchanged.

Since it is equivalent to a product of commuting observables, this tensor product of observables [formula] is therefore an observable too. Its eigenvectors are trivially the tensor products of the eigenvectors of Â and B̂, that is,

[formula]

and because of the linearity of the tensor product Hilbert space [formula], this equation can be written as:

[formula]

which means that [formula] is an eigenvector of [formula], and that its corresponding eigenvalue is the product aibj.

Entangled eigenvectors

However, there can exist other eigenvectors associated with the observable [formula]. The point is that for any observable, a linear combination of eigenvectors associated with the same degenerated eigenvalue λ is an eigenvector of this observable as well, with the same corresponding eigenvalue λ (see Cohen-Tannoudji et al.[\cite=ctdl1]). Hence, let [formula] and [formula] be two distinct eigenvectors of [formula], that is,

[formula]

sharing nonetheless the same degenerated eigenvalue λ as:

[formula]

This correlation degeneracy between [formula] and [formula] implies that a linear combination |ψ〉 of these two eigenvectors:

[formula]

is an eigenvector of [formula] as well. Indeed,

[formula]

and finally:

[formula]

It must be stressed that this vector |ψ〉 cannot be factored. Suppose for instance that |uk〉 = |um〉. Then ak = am, so that Eq. ([\ref=degenerated]) implies bl = bn, and since the bj are non degenerated eigenvalues, it implies |vl〉 = |vn〉, and therefore [formula] which is contradicting the above condition ([\ref=distinct]). In other words, |ψ〉 is an entangled vector.

Therefore, Eq. ([\ref=enteigenv2]) means that the entangled vector |ψ〉 is an eigenvector of [formula]. Hence, a [formula] measurement performed on a system initially in the entangled state |ψ〉 gives with certainty the measurement result λ, and the system remains after this measurement in the initial state |ψ〉. In other words, the correlation degeneracy of Eq. ([\ref=degenerated]) implies that [formula] is a non demolition measurement for the entangled state |ψ〉. The main question that will be addressed in this article is of the relevance of Eq. ([\ref=enteigenv2]), that is, whether it is meaningful or not to understand an entangled vector |ψ〉 as an eigenvector of a tensor product observable [formula].

Joint measurements on entangled vectors

Although mathematically consistent with Quantum Mechanical formalism, this non demolition prediction can actually be questioned on a physical ground, by taking count of the local measurement results, that is, of the fact that a [formula] measurement means that Alice performs a Â measurement on subsystem S1 while Bob performs a B̂ measurement on subsystem S2, as expressed in Eq. ([\ref=tensorid]). The point is that although the eigenvectors [formula] and [formula] of [formula] do share the same degenerated eigenvalue λ, they can nevertheless be distinguished by the [formula] measurement alone, simply by asking Alice and Bob what were exactly the local measurements they did record each. They can unmistakably make a distinction between [formula] and [formula], since the eigenvalues of Â and B̂ are not degenerated (i.e., Alice can distinguish ak from am, and Bob can distinguish bl from bn). The correlation degeneracy of the eigenvalue λ associated with the [formula] measurement is therefore not physically meaningful since it can be resolved by this very [formula] measurement alone. Hence, the non demolition prediction for the entangled state |ψ〉 obtained in Sect. [\ref=entangeig] should be questioned as it originates in this correlation degeneracy.

Indeed, suppose a physical system is prepared in the entangled state |ψ〉 of Eq. ([\ref=entangv]), with a normalisation condition |α1|2 + |α2|2 = 1, and that Alice and Bob are to perform a [formula] measurement on this system. According to the von Neumann reduction postulate [\cite=JVN1], the two possible joint measurement results are:

Alice records ak while Bob records bl, in which case Alice knows with certainty that after her Â measurement the subsystem S1 is in the state |uk〉, while Bob knows with certainty that after his B̂ measurement the system S2 is in the state |vl〉, so that the state of the whole system after the [formula] measurement is [formula]. The probability to record this joint measurement results is

[formula]

Alice records am while Bob records bn, in which case Alice knows with certainty that after her Â measurement the subsystem S1 is in the state |um〉, while Bob knows with certainty that after his B̂ measurement the system S2 is in the state |vn〉, so that the state of the whole system after the [formula] measurement is [formula]. The probability to record this joint measurement results is

[formula]

Hence, a [formula] measurement performed on an entangled system |ψ〉 transforms it either into a system represented by the state [formula] or into a system represented by the state [formula], depending on the measurement results recorded by Alice and Bob, which means that the [formula] measurement is a demolition measurement for the entangled state |ψ〉, contrary to what was suggested by Eq. ([\ref=enteigenv2]). Therefore, the use of correlation degeneracy, which is responsible for the incorrect understanding of the entangled state |ψ〉 as an eigenvector of [formula], is physically meaningless and must be discarded.

Joint Eigenvalues

The correlation degeneracy originates in the linearity of tensor product Hilbert spaces, that is, in

[formula]

where α and β are any complex numbers. As seen in Sect. [\ref=phys], when these numbers are eigenvalues, this computation of two localized real eigenvalues into a non-localized single eigenvalue λ makes no physical sense since a part of the information is arbitrarily lost in the process, although this loss has no physical counterpart. Thus, in order to get only physically meaningful predictions, such as those of Sect. [\ref=phys], the proposal of this article is to slightly change Quantum Mechanical formalism for joint measurements, so that a joint measurement can no longer be associated with only one single computed eigenvalue λ, but with a couple of eigenvalues (α,β) instead, that is, a joint eigenvalue axiomatically defined as:

[formula]

so that the eigenvectors of [formula] are such that

[formula]

which reads as follow: (ai,bj) is the joint eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector [formula]. The advantage of this notation is that the physically distinct eigenvectors [formula] and [formula] are no longer associated with the same degenerated eigenvalue λ, but with distinct joint eigenvalue instead: with (ak,bl)  ≠  (am,bn), meaning that these joint eigenvalues are non degenerated, as {ai} and {bj} are non degenerated spectrum.

With this explicit notation, the physically meaningless loss of information due to the use of correlation degeneracy is avoided, and the entangled state |ψ〉 no longer appears deceitfully as an eigenvector of [formula] since the eigenvectors it is made of are associated with distinct joint eigenvalues. This allows conveniently to recover directly the correct physical predictions given in Sect. [\ref=phys], without allowing the wrong predictions of Sect. [\ref=entangeig].

Unfortunately, these wrong predictions based on correlation degeneracy seem at first sight so mathematically correct that there exist many examples in the recent literature of such an implicit misuse of Quantum Mechanical formalism, among which are the famous Bell states and Quantum Teleportation.

Application to the Bell states

The Bell states[\cite=Braunstein1] are entangled states defined within tensor products of spin Hilbert spaces. Spin measurements can be represented within spin Hilbert space by the Pauli matrices σx, σy, and σz (to simplify notation, [formula] is set to 1 throughout), with the following eigenvectors and eigenvalues:

[formula]

and the eigenvectors of σx and σy can be written within the z-basis {| + 〉,| - 〉} as

[formula]

The tensor product Hilbert space [formula] where the Bell states are to be written can thus be spanned by the product basis formed by the four eigenvectors {| +  + 〉,| +  - 〉,| -  + 〉,| -  - 〉} associated with the tensor product observable [formula].

Bell states with correlation degeneracy

With the use of correlation degeneracy, the eigenvector of [formula] have two possible degenerated eigenvalues - 1 or + 1 as: that is, on one hand | +  - 〉 and | -  + 〉 are eigenvectors associated with the degenerated eigenvalue - 1, and on the other hand | +  + 〉 and | -  - 〉 are eigenvectors associated with the degenerated eigenvalue + 1 (see Eq. [\ref=degenerated]).

Hence, akin to what was done in Sect. [\ref=entangeig], one can build other eigenvectors of [formula], by combining eigenvectors associated with the same degenerated eigenvalue (see Eq. [\ref=entangv]), that is, two normalized states |Ψ+〉 and |Ψ-〉 made up with eigenvectors ([\ref=sigmaeb]) and ([\ref=sigmaec]) associated with the degenerated eigenvalue - 1: and two others normalized states |Φ+〉 and |Φ-〉 made up with eigenvectors ([\ref=sigmaea]) and ([\ref=sigmaed]) associated with the degenerated eigenvalue + 1 : These are the so called Bell states[\cite=Braunstein1], and one can verify easily that these vectors are orthonormal [\cite=Bennet1], so that they can apparently be used as basis vectors to span the tensor product Hilbert space H.

Following the argument of Sect. [\ref=entangeig], one can make use of the fact that a Bell state is built up exclusively with eigenvectors of [formula] associated with one degenerated eigenvalue, so that it is an eigenvectors of [formula] as well, with this same eigenvalue (see Eq. [\ref=enteigenv2]): and with the help of Eq. ([\ref=spinx]), the Bell states can be shown to be eigenvectors of the observable [formula] too: (See Cabello [\cite=Cabello1] for instance), which means that [formula] and [formula] are non demolition operators for the Bell states.

An important consequence is that for any state |ψ〉 written within the Bell state basis, the following equation holds:

[formula]

as one can easily verify with Eqs. ([\ref=Bell1]) and ([\ref=Bell2]), which means that [formula] and [formula] are commuting observables:

[formula]

However, these widely accepted results [\cite=Braunstein1] [\cite=Cabello1] [\cite=Braunstein2] [\cite=Larsen1] [\cite=Cabello2] [\cite=Aravind1] [\cite=Lomonaco1] are based on the use of correlation degeneracy. Since this use was shown in Sect. [\ref=phys] to lead to wrong physical predictions, and thus discarded, a closer analysis with the help of joint eigenvalues is required.

Bell states with joint eigenvalues

The joint eigenvalues associated with the eigenvectors of [formula] are as follow: These distinct joint eigenvalues make explicit the fact that Alice and Bob can unmistakably discriminate these states by means of the [formula] measurement alone (see Sect. [\ref=phys]) since they can both make a distinction between a + 1 result and a - 1 result. The eigenvectors of [formula] are therefore no longer associated with degenerated eigenvalues, but with non degenerated joint eigenvalues instead, so that they can no longer be combined to form other eigenvectors. Hence, the Bell states no longer appear deceitfully as eigenvectors of [formula], [formula], or [formula]. In other words, the Eqs. ([\ref=Bell1]), ([\ref=Bell2]), and ([\ref=commutation]) which are all based on the use of correlation degeneracy are therefore incorrect.

To pinpoint this more explicitly, suppose Alice and Bob are to perform a [formula] measurement on a system initially in the singlet state |Ψ-〉 of Eq. ([\ref=singlet]). In this state, | +  - 〉 corresponds to the joint eigenvalue ( + 1, - 1), whereas | -  + 〉 corresponds to the joint eigenvalue ( - 1, + 1). Hence, according to the projection postulate, the measurement results recorded by Alice and Bob are either given by:

the joint eigenvalue ( + 1, - 1), meaning that Alice records + 1 while Bob records - 1, in which case Alice knows with certainty that after her σz measurement the subsystem S1 is in the state | + 〉, while Bob knows with certainty that after his σz measurement the system S2 is in the state | - 〉, so that the state of the whole system after the [formula] measurement is |ψ1'〉 = | +  - 〉. The probability to record this joint measurement result is

[formula]

the joint eigenvalue ( - 1, + 1), meaning that Alice records - 1 while Bob records + 1, in which case Alice knows with certainty that after her σz measurement the subsystem S1 is in the state | - 〉, while Bob knows with certainty that after his σz measurement the system S2 is in the state | + 〉, so that the state of the whole system after the [formula] measurement is |ψ2'〉 = | -  + 〉. The probability to record this joint measurement result is

[formula]

Once this [formula] measurement has been performed, the system is no longer in the singlet state, it is either in the state |ψ1'〉 = | +  - 〉 or in the state |ψ2'〉 = | -  + 〉, depending on the measurement results recorded by Alice and Bob. The [formula] measurement is therefore a demolition measurement for the singlet state |Ψ-〉, unlike what was found in Sect. [\ref=Bellcode].

This has important consequences. For instance, let's suppose the latter case ( - 1, + 1) has been realized : Alice did record a - 1 result, while Bob recorded + 1. The state of the system after this measurement is therefore |ψ'2〉 = | -  + 〉. Now, Alice and Bob are to perform the second measurement [formula] on this system. The state of the system must therefore be projected onto the x-basis with the help of Eq. ([\ref=spinx]), that is,

[formula]

which means that there are four possible couples of outcomes: ( + 1, + 1), ( + 1, - 1), ( - 1, + 1), or ( - 1, - 1), each joint eigenvalue having the same probability [formula] to occur. Note that the correlation between Alice and Bob measurement results is no longer necessarily equal to - 1, unlike what would have been predicted using Eqs. ([\ref=singleteigz]) and ([\ref=singleteigx]). After this second measurement the system is in the x-basis vectors | +  + 〉x, | +  - 〉x, | -  + 〉x or | -  - 〉x corresponding to the observed joint eigenvalue. Had the measurements been performed in the reverse order, that is, the [formula] measurement followed by the [formula] measurement, the final state of the system would have been one of the z-basis vectors | +  + 〉, | +  - 〉, | -  + 〉, or | -  - 〉. Since any x-basis vector is distinct from any z-basis vector, then [formula] and [formula] are not at all equivalent measurements, which means that [formula] and [formula] are not commuting observables:

[formula]

contrary to what was found in Sect. [\ref=Bellcode] and most unlike what can be found in the literature. Note that since the incorrect commutation prediction of Eq. ([\ref=comm]) was due to the implicit use of correlation degeneracy, the use of joint eigenvalues would have directly prevented from such a mistake. Incidentally, this non commutation result based on quantum postulates is in itself sufficient to refute a class of Bell's theorem without inequalities [\cite=Cabello1] [\cite=Aravind1] [\cite=Mermin1] based on this physically incorrect commutation of [formula] and [formula], or similarly of [formula] and [formula].

Application to Quantum Teleportation

Quantum Teleportation Scheme

One of the most important use of the Bell states is made by Quantum Teleportation, as originally conceived by Bennet et al[\cite=Bennet1]. Basically, the principle of Quantum Teleportation is as follow:

Alice takes particle 2 with her, and Bob goes wherever he wants with particle 3 as long as particles 2 and 3 remain entangled. Then, Alice is given an unknown state carried by a particle, labeled 1, written within a spin Hilbert space H1 as:

so that the state of the whole system owned by Alice and Bob is:

Alice's purpose is to have the state carried by particle 1 "teleported" to particle 3.

that is,

Note that at this point no physical modification of the system has occurred yet.

This reduction is the crucial step of the whole process. This point will be reviewed with more details in the next section.

which is a quantum-quantum interaction between S1 and S2. The state of the system after this transformation is:

which means explicitly that the system is in a mixture of the following pure states:

Refutation of this Quantum Teleportation Scheme

The point of this section is to demonstrate in the light of Sects. [\ref=math] and [\ref=Appl] that although absolutely essential to the Quantum Teleportation process, Step 3 cannot be performed by any measurement apparatus as it is actually irrelevant to Quantum Mechanics.

First, it is important to stress the distinction between Step 2, an algebraic operation which doesn't change the physics behind the vector state--as Eq. ([\ref=init]) is then simply rewritten in a more suggestive way--and Step 3, a physical measurement which strongly change the nature of the state--from the pure state of Eq. ([\ref=TelEq1]) to the mixture of states of Eq. ([\ref=density1]).

The point is that Step 3 is absolutely essential to complete a Quantum Teleportation scheme, that is, Step 2 and Step 4 alone are not enough to guarantee the completion of the quantum teleportation process. Indeed, if the conditional spin flip [formula] is applied (Step 4) directly on the initial pure state of Eq.([\ref=TelEq1]) written in the Bell states basis (Step 2) instead of the mixture of Eq. ([\ref=density1]), as is sometimes suggested in the literature [\cite=Lomonaco1], then the result is radically different than the desired teleportation:

[formula]

as it is easy to check that [formula], and therefore:

[formula]

This is but a conditional spin flip applied on the initial state written in the spin states basis, not at all a teleportation scheme. Note that this problem does not arise when ÛC is applied on the mixture ρ'123 (i.e., after Step 3), as is done in Eq. ([\ref=transdens]), since the conditional spin flip [formula] is then by no means applied on |ψ123〉 but on the |ψ'α〉 states instead, leading indeed to a teleportation scheme.

Therefore, being able to discriminate between the four Bell states - or even to discriminate just one Bell state [\cite=Braunstein2] [\cite=Bouwmeester1] - requires that the system hold by Alice is already in one of the four Bell states, which is not enough to perform a quantum teleportation: Alice must first find a way to reduce the pure state of Eq. ([\ref=TelEq1]) into the mixture of Eq. ([\ref=density1]).

To perform the reduction of Step 3, a measurement represented by an observable having the four Bell states for eigenvectors must be performed on the system described by the pure state |ψ123〉. Indeed, according to the von Neumann reduction postulate, if a measurement represented in [formula] by an observable having the four Bell states for eigenvectors is performed on the system |ψ123〉, then one particular projection P̂α on the Bell states occurs with the probability

[formula]

and the corresponding final state of the whole system is

[formula]

which is one of the state of Eqs. ([\ref=TelEq2]), so that the system is indeed represented by the mixture of Eq. ([\ref=density1]).

In the literature, the well known operator supposed to achieve this task is the Bell operator [\cite=Braunstein1], defined as

[formula]

Of course, as long as [formula] and [formula] were understood as commuting observables sharing the Bell states as eigenvectors (as was the case in Sect. [\ref=Bellcode], and always the case in the literature), the Bell operator, which is a linear combination of these observables, appeared as an observable as well with the Bell states for eigenvectors. However, as seen in Sect. [\ref=Bellcode], these predictions are based on the use of correlation degeneracy and are therefore incorrect. It was demonstrated on the contrary in Sect. [\ref=Belljoei] that:

the Bell states are not eigenvectors of [formula] and [formula].

[formula] and [formula] are not commuting observables.

Hence, the Bell states are a priori not eigenvectors of the Bell operator, and as a linear combination of non commuting observables, the Bell operator is a priori not even an observable. In particular it is definitely not equivalent to a [formula] measurement followed by a [formula] measurement, unlike what is sometimes met in the literature [\cite=Cabello1] [\cite=Larsen1].

Note that the proposition made by Fujii [\cite=Fujii1] to circumvent the problem raised here with another linear combination such as [formula] instead of the Bell operator is of no help: the problem arises for any linear combinations of [formula] and [formula], since these observables do not commute and since their eigenvectors are not the Bell states.

More generally, discarding the use of correlation degeneracy - which is made necessary by the wrong predictions of Sects. [\ref=entangeig] and [\ref=Bellcode], implies that the mere possibility of an observable having the Bell states for eigenvectors is physically meaningless, as it requires the very use of correlation degeneracy and all its corollary of wrong predictions. In other words, no observable has the Bell states for eigenvectors. Therefore, Step 3 is irrelevant to Quantum Mechanics, and no measurement is capable of triggering the reduction of the pure state of Eq. ([\ref=TelEq1]) into the mixture of Eq. ([\ref=density1]). Without this essential Step 3, the ideal scheme described in Sect. [\ref=QTscheme] is therefore incomplete, and cannot to lead to any Quantum Teleportation.

Conclusion

The inconsistency pointed out within Quantum Mechanics between the predictions derived from the use of correlation degeneracy (in Sect. [\ref=entangeig]) and the predictions derived from the quantum postulates (in Sect. [\ref=phys]) was solved by the introduction of joint eigenvalue representation (in Sect. [\ref=jointeigen]). The use of entangled states as eigenvectors of tensor product observables was thus discarded. Applied to the Bell states (in Sect. [\ref=Appl]), these results led to rather different predictions than those usually encountered in the literature. It was shown as a consequence (in Sect. [\ref=QTeleport]) that since it requires the use of such entangled vectors as eigenvectors, the concept of Quantum Teleportation is therefore irrelevant to Quantum Mechanics.
