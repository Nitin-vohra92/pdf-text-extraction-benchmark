Local Properties of Self-Dual Harmonic 2-forms on a 4-Manifold

Introduction

This paper is a study of generic self-dual (SD) harmonic 2-forms ω near its zero set. Let M4 be a closed, oriented 4-manifold with b+2 > 0. Then, for a pair (ω,g) consisting of a generic metric g and a self-dual harmonic 2-form ω with respect to g, (ω,g) represents a section of [formula], which is transverse to the zero section. Here [formula] is the subbundle of [formula] whose fiber over a point p∈M is [formula]. In particular, the zeros of ω are disjoint embedded circles. Since [formula], ω is nondegenerate at p if and only if [formula]. That is, ω is closed and symplectic away from the union of circles C, and is identically 0 on C.

We also have a relative version of the previous discussion, which is the following theorem (cf. [\cite=Honda]):

Let (ω0,g0) and (ω1,g1) be harmonic forms transverse to [formula] and [formula], respectively. If there exists a path (ωt,gt) of harmonic forms ωt with respect to gt such that [formula] for all t∈[0,1], then there exists a Gδ-set of perturbations [formula] of this path, fixing endpoints, such that [formula] has regular zeros in M  ×  [0,1].

Note: The conditions for the theorem are minimal. The space {(ω,g)|g∈k(M),   *  ω  =  ω, Δgω = 0} is diffeomorphic to b+2  ×  k(M), where k(M) is the space of Ck-metrics on M, and, as long as b+2 > 1, we can always connect (ω0,g0) to (ω1,g1) via a cobordism such that [formula] for all t∈[0,1]. In the case b+2 = 1, as long as (ω0,g0) and (ω1,g1) lie on the same side of the real line, there exists a cobordism.

We briefly outline the contents of the paper. In Section 3, we will discuss a version of Moser's theorem (Theorem [\ref=thm:sddiffeo]) which applies to our singular symplectic forms. In Section 4, we classify local normal forms of the singular symplectic forms near an S1, with an eye towards global results, and in the last section we discuss the induced contact structures on the boundaries of N(S1). These remarks lay the groundwork for the Floer homology of singular symplectic forms, which we hope to return to in a subsequent paper.

Almost complex structures

Observe first that we can define an almost complex structure J on M - C.

If ω is a self-dual harmonic 2-form which is nondegenerate on a connected set M - C, then there exists a unique almost complex structure J compatible with ω and [formula] on M - C, where [formula] is conformally equivalent to g.

Proof: Any 2-form ω can be written, with respect to the metric g, as

[formula]

with e1,...,e4 orthonormal and positively oriented at a point p∈M - C.

For ω to be self-dual, λ1  =  λ2. Hence,

[formula]

This λ is well-defined up to sign: Simply consider [formula], with dvg the volume form for g. Since λ2 is only dependent on ω and g, we can determine λ up to sign. However, taking advantage of M - C being connected, we may fix λ on all of M - S so that λ > 0.

We then set J:e1  ↦  e2,e2  ↦   - e1,e3  ↦  e4,e4  ↦   - e3. This definition is equivalent to the following: Let   =  λg, and define J such that (x,y) = ω(Jx,y). Hence we see that if there is a J compatible with ω and [formula], it must be unique. Thus J is compatible with ω and   =  λg on M - C. [formula]

Observe that ω is defined on all of M and is zero on C, [formula] can be defined on all of M and is zero on C, but is not smooth on C, while J is defined only on M - C.

Let {(ωt,gt)} be a regular cobordism. As in the previous proposition, we can define λt uniformly over [formula] and get a family {(ωt,,Jt)}, which is compatible where defined.

Moser argument for self-dual harmonic 2-forms

Consider M4 as above. Let {ωt} be a generic family of self-dual harmonic 2-forms such that

(i) ∈H2(M;) is constant.

(ii) The sets Ct  =  {x∈M|ωt(x) = 0} are all S1's; hence via a diffeomorphism, we may assume that C = Ct is a fixed S1.

(iii) ∈H2(M,C;) does not vary with t.

If we assume that C is contractible, then we are asking for the following:

(iii') Let Ω be an oriented surface with ∂Ω = C. Then [formula] does not vary with t.

Then we have the following:

There exists a 1-parameter family of C1-diffeomorphisms of M, which is smooth away from C, and takes [formula] symplectically.

This generalizes the classical

Let {ωt} be a family of symplectic forms on a closed manifold M. Provided ∈H2(M;) is fixed, there is a 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms φt such that φ*tωt  =  ω0.

Proof: (Moser) Let ηt be a 1-parameter family of 1-forms such that [formula]. Thus, if we define Xt such that iXtωt  =  ηt, then [formula], which, integrated, gives a 1-parameter family φt such that φ*tωt  =  ω0. [formula]

Proof: (Theorem [\ref=thm:sddiffeo]) The point here is to find a suitable ηt such that [formula] and ηt|C = 0. Fix some t such that [formula]. We shall find a function ft on M such that t = dft "up to first order" near C.

Condition (iii) implies that there exists an ft on C such that i*t = dft, where i:C  →  M is the inclusion, i.e. i*t is exact. In particular, assuming (iii') we have

[formula]

In order to extend ft to a neighborhood N(C) of C, first observe that there is only one orientable rank 3 bundle over S1 (π1(BSO(3)) = 0 implies S1  →  BSO(3) is homotopically trivial) and hence N(C)≃C  ×  D3. Choose coordinates (θ,x1,x2,x3) such that dθ,dx1,dx2,dx3 at (θ,0) are orthonormal.

Setting

[formula]

on N(C), where [formula], we have

[formula]

up to first order in the xi's. Now observing that

[formula]

[formula]

and that Equation [\ref=eq2] gives

[formula]

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

up to first order in x.

Damping ft out to 0 outside N(C), we arrive at ηt  =  t - dft. Finally, we obtain the vector field Xt such that iXtωt  =  ηt. Xt will then give rise to a 1-parameter family of symplectomorphisms, away from C, once we establish that Xt  →  0 rapidly enough as p  →  C (p∈M).

On N(C),

[formula]

where [formula] and Q consists of forms in dθ and dxi, whose coefficients are quadratic or higher in the xi. In terms of matrices, ωt corresponds to

[formula]

where [formula] has quadratic or higher terms in the xi and the matrix is with respect to basis {dθ,dx1,dx2,dx3}. iXtωt  =  ηt then becomes

[formula]

with [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

up to first order in x. This means that |Xt| < k|x| near C; hence, as x  →  0, |φ1(θ,x) - φ0(θ,x)|  →  0, where φt is the flow such that [formula]. This concludes our proof. [formula]

Local normal forms

On a neighborhood N(C) = C  ×  D3 of C, ω can be written as in Equation [\ref=Lij]. If ω is generic, then it is transverse to the zero section of [formula], and (Lij(θ)) is nondegenerate for all θ.

(Lij(θ)) is symmetric and traceless.

Proof: By comparing 0th order terms in the xi, dω = 0 implies

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

(Lij(θ)) thus has a basis {v1(θ),v2(θ),v3(θ)} of eigenvectors for each θ (though the vi are not necessarily continuous in θ). Since (Lij(θ)) is traceless, either two of the eigenvalues are positive and the remaining is negative for all θ, or vice versa. Hence, (Lij(θ)) gives rise to a splitting of 3  ×  S1  →  S1 into a real line bundle over S1 and a rank 2 vector bundle over S1. Such splittings are classified by homotopy classes of S1 into 2, and π1(2) =  / 2. Hence,

There exist two splittings of 3  ×  S1  →  S1, the oriented one and the unoriented one.

What is rather remarkable is that we have the following:

There exist SD harmonic 2-forms for the product metric on S1  ×  D3 for both types of splittings:

(A)

[formula]

where [formula], and *  3 is the *  -operator for the flat metric on D3. Here, (Lij(θ)) = (1,1, - 2), with fixed positive and negative eigenspaces. Note that ωA is S1-invariant.

(B)

[formula]

with 0 < R < 1. Here,

[formula]

Observe that there are two positive eigenvectors, one of which is (0,0,1). It is a direct computation to show that dωB = 0 and that the splitting of 3 given by (Lij(θ)) is the unoriented one.

We can alternatively construct an ωB, which is not the same as the one above, but arises more naturally. Starting with

[formula]

on ×  D3, we glue φ:{2π}  ×  D3  →  {0}  ×  D3 via

[formula]

φ*ω  =  ω, and obtain an ωB on S1  ×  S2 corresponding to the unoriented splitting.

Given an SD harmonic 2-form ω, there exists a 1-parameter family of perturbations {ωt}, local near C, such that ω0  =  ω, ω1|N(C) is one of the two local forms as in Theorem [\ref=two] (up to ±  ω), and ∈H2(M;) is independent of t.

Proof: Given ω, consider the neighborhood N(C) = C  ×  D3 of one of the circles. Assume we are in case (A). Case (B) is identical. After an orthonormal change of frame, we may write

[formula]

with, say, (Lij(θ))1  ≤  i,j  ≤  2 positive definite and λ3(θ) < 0. Here, the Lij(θ) and λ3(θ) are differentiable in θ.

Now, take a 1-parameter family ωt = (1 - t)ω + tωA on N(C). After shrinking N(C) if necessary, ωt is symplectic on N(C) away from C. Using a local version of Moser's theorem (see the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:sddiffeo]), we see that there exists a C1-diffeomorphism

[formula]

where N0(C), N1(C) are small neighborhoods of C, φ = id on C, and φ is a smooth map away from C. Hence φ allows us to remove (N0(C),ω) and graft on (N1(C),ωA). We can perform this operation through a 1-parameter family ωt, and hence there exists a global family ωt on M with ω0  =  ω and ω1|N(C)  =  ωA. Moreover, the perturbation can be performed in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of C and without altering the cohomology class. [formula]

In essence, Theorem [\ref=local] tells us that, in studying the singular circles of ω, we may assume that the zeros are either (A) or (B).

Contact structures on the boundaries

In this section we investigate the boundary properties of ωA and ωB. More precisely, we have

There exist contact forms λA and λB on ∂N(C) = S1  ×  S2 such that dλA  =  ωA and dλB  =  ωB on S1  ×  S2.

Proof: (A) For example, consider the following S1-invariant contact 1-form

[formula]

on N(C). We then compute that dλ  =  ω on N(C) and

[formula]

Since [formula] is a leaf of [formula], [formula] if and only if [formula] on S1  ×  S2. Here iS1  ×  S2 is the inclusion S1  ×  S2  →  S1  ×  D3. Noting that [formula] if and only if x1 = x2 = x3 = 0, we have that i*S1  ×  S2(λ) is a contact 1-form on S1  ×  S2 with di*S1  ×  S2(λ) = i*S1  ×  S2. Thus, (M - N(S1),ω) is a symplectic manifold with contact boundary.

(B) Consider the 1-form

[formula]

on ×  D3. dλ  =  ω, and φ*λ  =  λ, where φ was the glueing map of Theorem [\ref=two], so we glue together a contact 1-form λB such that dλB  =  ωB. The rest is the same as (A). [formula]

Let us now describe the orbits of the Reeb vector fields. (A) ωA is compatible with a metric   =  λg, where g is the standard product metric on S1  ×  D3. We can then write the compatible J satisfying (x,y) = ω(Jx,y) as [formula], where

[formula]

represents ω with respect to {θ,x1,x2,x3}. Now, the Reeb vector field X for i*S1  ×  S2ω is given, up to multiple, by

[formula]

Finally, λA(X) = 1 implies that

[formula]

with

[formula]

Solving for the orbits, x21 + x22 and x23 are fixed for each orbit, and hence,

[formula]

where r is a constant, and R1 and R2 are functions of r.

In particular, the noteworthy closed orbits are {(0,0,1)}  ×  S1, {(0,0, - 1)}  ×  S1, and {(x1,x2,0)}  ×  S1, with x21 + x22 = 1 and x1, x2 fixed. These correspond to the stable and unstable gradient directions in the Morse theory of [formula] near (0,0,0). Moreover, the orbit {(0,0,1)}  ×  S1 is nondegenerate, and so is the family {(x1,x2,0)}  ×  S1. There are other closed orbits, but these do not seem to have any Morse-theoretic significance.

(B) We apply the previous considerations and work on ×  S1  /    ~  . There is one orbit {(0,0,  ±  1)}  ×  S1, which is a double of the orbits for (A). Since φ identifies (2π,(x1,x2,0))  ~  (0,(x1, - x2,0)), we also have the doubled closed orbits {(x1,  ±  x2,0)}  ×  S1, with [formula], and the single closed orbits {(1,0,0)}  ×  S1, {( - 1,0,0)}  ×  S1.

Remark: There is an example of a singularity of type (B) bounding a disk, which can be made to vanish.
