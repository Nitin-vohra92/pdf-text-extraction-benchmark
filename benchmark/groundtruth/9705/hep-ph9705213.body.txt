Introduction

It is now over twenty years, when the SU(5) model was proposed by Georgi and Glashow, that unification programme has been carried over, looking for a Gauge Unified Theory (GUT) based on a larger symmetry simple group G embedding the standard one, [formula], to which it breaks down.

The most peculiar signature of these theories is the non conservation of baryonic number which, in particular, allows for proton instability. For long time the comparison of the predicted proton lifetime with the experimental lower bound has been the only crucial test that GUT's should satisfy. In this respect the minimal version of the SU(5) model, in which Higgs scalars are classified in [formula], is at variance with the very precise measurements of the three coupling constants αs, αL and αY of, respectively, SU(3)c, S(2)L and U(1)Y at the Z0 mass scale. Actually in 1990-1991 [\cite=ambu] [\cite=amfu] it became clear that the three couplings do not match at a single point, and this rules out the minimal SU(5) model.

The big interplay between particle physics and cosmology, as well as the increase in precision of cosmological measurements, open the perspective of using the history of universe as a natural laboratory in which to check the predictions at high energies of classes of unified theories. Items as the production of heavy monopoles, the origin of baryonic matter-antimatter asymmetry or the nature of dark matter in the galactic halos, provide a set of additional constraints which are, sometimes, quite stringent.

In this paper we would like to account for the main features of a class of models based on the SO(10) gauge group. Interestingly, they are able to predict a value for τp  →  e+π0 in agreement with the experimental lower limit, as well as neutrino masses of the order of magnitude required to explain solar neutrino problem using MSW [\cite=miwo], and to give the status to τ neutrinos of interesting candidates for the hot component of the dark matter. Moreover, we will discuss how, within SO(10) models, the three conditions necessary to have production of a baryon asymmetry [\cite=saka] appears to be naturally satisfied and a value for the baryon to photon density in agreement with data on primordial nucleosynthesis emerges.

SO(10) Gauge Theories

SO(10) has been proposed [\cite=geor] as a unifying gauge group with three main motivations:

models based on this gauge group are naturally anomaly free. What appeared as a chance in SU(5) model, because of their exact compensation due to the use of 10 and [formula] to classify fermions, is a general feature of all orthogonal groups, with the only exception of SO(6);

the 10 and [formula] representations of SU(5) are contained in the 16 (spinorial) representation of SO(10) together with a SU(5) singlet with the quantum numbers of a [formula];

the 16 of SO(10) decomposes under [formula], the gauge group first introduced by Pati and Salam, into the [formula] representation, which displays the quark-lepton universality of weak interactions.

Quite recently other interesting features of the models have been also investigated:

the possibility, through the see-saw mechanism [\cite=gera], to give cosmologically and astrophysically interesting Majorana mass to neutrinos;

the explanation of baryon asymmetry of the universe through out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Higgs bosons and of low energy sphaleron-like processes.

A study of the low dimensional Irreducible Representations (IR's) of SO(10) shows that their singlets (with the only exception of the vector-spinor representation 144) have symmetry larger than G321. Therefore, at least two of them are necessary to drive the symmetry breaking process of SO(10) down to G321, via an intermediate symmetry stage with an unbroken subgroup G', whose energy scale we will denote with MR. Beyond SU(5) (or [formula]), there are four intriguing cases which correspond to several G'. They are listed in Table I togheter with the direction of the minimum of Higgs potential.

Table I

ωab is a second-rank traceless symmetric tensor; Φabcd is a fourth-rank antisymmetric tensor, and the indices 1...6 correspond to SO(6)  ~  SU(4)PS, whereas 7...0 correspond to [formula].

For the models in Table I it is possible to show that, at one loop approximation, and within the Extended Survival Hypothesis (ESH), i.e. by only considering scalars in the renormalization group equations (RGE) which are required to drive symmetry breaking at MR and at the electroweak scale, the first breaking scale MX corresponding to [formula] is not higher than the meeting point of α3 and α2 in the SU(5) minimal model [\cite=bumi]. In particular, with two doublets of scalars in the 10 (to avoid the prediction mt = mb), one can get the inequality

[formula]

Since the lepto-quarks responsible for proton decay take mass at MX, this inequality traduces into an upper limit for exclusive processes lifetime, since [formula]. A more restrictive bound, by a factor of about [formula], can be obtained using a two-loop approximation [\cite=acam].

It is also worth reminding that the intermediate scale MR at which [formula] breakes down to the standard group G321 is connected, via the see-saw mechanism [\cite=gera], to Majorana mass for L. This allows for quite interesting prediction for ντ and νμ masses. We will come back to this point later on. For the value of MR, at one loop and still using ESH, it was possible to find an upper limit for MR

[formula]

where the equality holds only for the model with [formula], whose prediction for MX, however, is too small when compared with experimental lower limit.

Because of the richness of the mass spectrum of SO(10) models, it may seem that ESH is a too restrictive assumption. Actually this observation led Dixit and Sher to claim that huge uncertainties are introduced in the SO(10) predictions if ESH is removed [\cite=dish]. However, as it has been explicitly shown in a recent paper [\cite=acam], by carefully studying the mass spectrum, it is possible to deduce rather restrictive conditions on the contributions of the scalars to RGE. In this way, by requiring for MX a value sufficiently high to be in agreement with the lower limit on τp  →  e+π0, it is possible to find upper limits on MR, which correspond to lower limits on the masses of the (almost) left-handed neutrinos.

Prediction on symmetry breaking scales

To obtain the values of MX and MR it is necessary to study the mass spectrum of scalars that, according to the decoupling theorem of Appelquist-Carrazzone, would contribute to RGE. In the following we quote the results of a detailed study performed on the mass spectrum characterizing the various models of Table I. (for a complete analysis see [\cite=acam]). The mass of the multiplet (d1,...,dn), transforming as a di dimensional IR under the factor Gi  ⊂  G', will be denoted with m(d1,...,dn)

[formula]

In the following we will use the values for sin 2θW, αs and α at the MZ mass energy scale [\cite=lang]

[formula]

where the second error on the first two results is due to the uncertainty on the Higgs mass.

For this model we find, at one loop,

[formula]

with [formula] .

Thus, in this case, it is not possible to increase the value of MR. If one tries to get MX  ≥  3.2  ·  1015GeV it is necessary to take into account the request of having minimum in the [formula] direction, which gives, still at one loop,

[formula]

with [formula].

The same study can be performed at two loops in RGE. In this case we find (with all the multiplets at the scale MR but the (1,3,3) one, for which we have m(1,3,3)  ≤  1.35 ~ MR):

[formula]

[formula] is too small (about two standard deviations) to comply with the lower limit on proton lifetime.

[formula]

In this case, one obtains for MR:

[formula]

The ESH would imply m(1,2,2)10  ~  MZ, [formula] and all the other scalars with mass ~  MX. One would obtain for MR (this time MX is consistent with the experimental limit)

[formula]

To establish how strongly this result depend on ESH, we look for the highest value for MR consistent with a sufficiently high value for MX ([formula]).

From eqs. ([\ref=eq:btiz]), by taking m(10,3,1)  ≥  MR, in order to have the highest MR and the absolute minimum in the G422-invariant direction one has:

[formula]

From eqs. ([\ref=1031]) ([\ref=1531]) and ([\ref=1511]), one gets the following inequality:

[formula]

the last one coming from [formula].

The highest value for MR is found by taking (1,2,2)10 at the scale MZ, the multiplets (10,2,2)210, ~ (6,1,1)10 and all the states of the 126 at the scale MR and all the other states of the 210 at the scale MX: in such conditions one finds:

[formula]

[formula]

In this case, by keeping into account the SU(2)L  ↔  SU(2)R symmetry above MR, ESH would imply m(1,2,2,0)10  ~  MZ, m(1,3,1, - 2)126  ~  MR and all the other multiplets at the scale MX. One would get at two loops

[formula]

a too small value for τ(2)p  →  e+π0. In considering the contribution of the other scalars, the constraints on the mass spectrum, which follow from the requirement that the absolute minimum falls in the desired direction, implies the following inequalities for the masses

[formula]

In this way it is found:

[formula]

where the equality holds only in the extreme case with m(8,1,1,0)210, m(6,3,1,2 / 3)126 and m(8,2,2,0)126 at the scale MR and m(3,2,2,4 / 3)126 at the scale MX for eq. ([\ref=eq:mrfir]), and m(3,2,2, - 2 / 3)210, m(3,3,1, - 2 / 3)126 at the scale MR and m(1,2,2,2)210, m(8,1,1,0)210 and m(3,1,1, - 2 / 3)126 at the scale MX for eq. ([\ref=eq:mrsec]). The two requirements may not be satisfied at the same time, since they imply a different scale for m(8,1,1,0)210 and disagree with eq. ([\ref=eq:buc]), which implies that the concerned masses are at the same scale.

By eliminating MX in eqs. ([\ref=eq:mrfir]) and ([\ref=eq:mrsec]) one finds the inequality

[formula]

It would be possible, of course, to get a lower bound for MR since the one just written has been obtained by multiplying inequalities which cannot be both equalities. So it is not surprising that, by looking for the highest value for MR consistent with M(2)X  ≥  3.2  ·  1015 ~ GeV and with the constraints on the spectrum following, we find

[formula]

[formula]

In the ESH limit

[formula]

Due to the complexity of the conditions, we have not been able to deduce, as in the previous cases, intriguing inequalities for the one-loop equations, and a lenghty numerical analysis has been needed to get the highest value for MR [\cite=acam]. As a result, we found with the scalars of the [formula] at the scale MR and with the scalars of the 210 at the scale MX

[formula]

Baryogenesis

As shown by Sakharov [\cite=saka], three conditions should be satisfied to produce the baryon asymmetry, which is required in order to explain the result on baryon to photon density ηB in the universe, coming from primordial nucleosynthesis data, ηB  ~  (3  ÷  4) ~ 10- 10

baryon number (B) violating interactions;

C and CP violation;

non equilibrium conditions.

Because of 1), it was soon realised that GUT theories may be the natural framework for baryon asymmetry generation. In the standard scenario this asymmetry is produced by out of equilibrium decays of heavy Higgs scalars or gauge bosons into light fermions [\cite=kolb]. However it was pointed out by several authors [\cite=shap] that anomalous B + L violating processes (L is lepton number) mediated by sphaleronic [formula] gauge and Higgs configurations at low energy scale can almost completely wash out any asymmetry in B or L produced at GUT scales. Nevertheless, it is worth observing that these kind of effects cannot affect an asymmetry produced for B - L, since the corresponding current is anomaly free. A possible scenario for the production of ηB is therefore based on the idea that an asymmetry in this quantum number is produced at GUT scales and then it is eventually transformed into B and L asymmetries at low scales via the shuffling effect of sphaleronic configurations.

This possibility has been studied in the framework of SO(10) models in [\cite=buma], to which we refer for details. Notice that for minimal SU(5) model, B - L represents an accidental global symmetry and, therefore, no corresponding asymmetry can be produced in this case.

An interesting feature of SO(10) models is the possibility to define a charge conjugation operator C whose corresponding symmetry remains unbroken even after MX if G' has rank 5 [\cite=hase]. Notice that all models considered in the previous sections are just of this kind. It follows that any asymmetry in C-odd quantum number, as B - L, can only be produced after C is broken, i.e. when G' is spontaneosuly broken down to the standard model at MR. Interestingly enough, this scale is also the one at which B - L is no more a symmetry of the vacuum, what allows, if CP violating effects are also present, for the production of microscopic asymmetries δB - L in decay or scattering processes. In particular we have considered decays of heavy Higgs bosons Φ in channels containing massive L. Tipically one expects for δB - L values of the order

[formula]

where h denotes the order of magnitude of the Yukawa couplings which are involved in the process, Mν are the Majorana neutrino masses, MΦ is the mass of the decaying particle and finally εCP parametrizes the magnitude of CP violation. However, this microscopic asymmetry traduces into a macroscopic one only if decay processes occur out of equilibrium. If this is not the case, in fact, inverse decay processes and scattering mediated by virtual propagating Φ, would produce an opposite value for δB - L. Actually, from a thermodynamical point of view, no asymmetry corresponding to non exactly conserved quantum numbers can be generated in equilibrium conditions, since maximal entropy is obtained for vanishing corresponding chemical potentials.

We remind that a quite accurate indications of whether a decay process occurs in equilibrium or not is to compare the corresponding width Γ to the current value of the Hubble parameter H when the decaying massive particle becomes non-relativistic (T  ~  MΦ). In particular out of equilibrium conditions corresponds to Γ  ≤  H. In radiation dominated epoch, it holds [formula] with T the temperature, mPl the Planck mass and g the number of effective degrees of freedom (g  ~  100 at GUT scales). A more sophisticated analysis, using Boltzmann equations gives, in general, similar results [\cite=kolb]. The most natural candidates to produce a B - L asymmetry are the multiplets in the 126 IR which takes mass at MR and can decay in a L and a fermion f pairs. However, because of the quite low value of MR compared with Planck mass, these decays occurs in equilibrium since

[formula]

unless h is chosen unnaturally small.

For this reason, it seems that more suitable candidates for the Φ we are looking for, should have larger mass than MR, taken at the first symmetry breaking stage at MX. In addition they also have to be weakly coupled in order to survive down to MR, at which B - L violating processes become possible. A natural candidate satisfying the above conditions are the Higgs bosons in the 210 IR. They cannot be coupled to pair of fermions at tree level because 210 IR is not contained in the product 16 ×   16. Moreover effective terms in the lagrangian at higher order in perturbation theory are also absent if the intermediate group G' has rank 5. Since the fast decay channel in fermions pairs is forbidden, it has been shown in [\cite=buma], for the case [formula], that the most efficient channel is 210  →  126 ~ f ~ f, whose rate is sufficiently small to have an out of equilibrium overabundant population of these bosons at MR. When these decays eventually occur, for temperature below this scale, the particular channels 210  →  126 ~ L  ~  f produce a microscopic B - L asymmetry δB - L of the order of magnitude reported in ([\ref=order]). The macroscopic value for B - L asymmetry, Δ(B - L), in particular the ratio Δ(B - L) / s, where s is the specific entropy, can be evaluated by considering the dilution effect due to entropy release of decaying heavy bosons to radiation degrees of freedom [\cite=kolb].

[formula]

where h10 and h126 are the Yukawa coupling of 10 and 126 IR to fermions, respectively and TRH is the reheating temperature. This value, due to sphaleronic effects, traduces into a corresponding value for baryon asymmetry ΔB  ~  Δ(B - L) / 3, which for MΦ in the range 1012  ÷  1014 ~ GeV gives a result in agreement with the experimental value coming from the results on primordial nucleosynthesis of light nuclei, provided the CP parameter εCP is larger than 10- 2, which sounds quite reasonable.

Conclusions

In TABLE II and III we have reported the result on MX and MR for the models discussed in the previous sections, while in Figure 1 are shown the curves of level, in the plane sin 2θW  -  αs corresponding to several values of MR. The results of the analysis can be summarized as follows:

In case A of Table I the resulting value of MX, both with and without the ESH hypothesis, is too small in order to comply with the experimental limit on proton lifetime, so this possibility is ruled out from the present determinations of sin 2θW and αs;

case B gives a value for MX which is in agreement with τp  →  e+π0 only if ESH is released. Even in this case, the upper limit on MR gives, via the see-saw mechanism, a lower limit on ντ mass, namely mντ  ≥  80  ÷  140 ~ eV, depending on the values chosen for sin 2θW and αs, which is too high if compared with cosmological constraints on the age of the universe,

in case C, in the ESH limit, one has mντ  ~  15  ~  eV, which is in agreement with the idea that ντ gives a relevant contribution to the hot component of dark matter. By releasing ESH one gets instead the lower limit mντ  ≥  0.2  ÷  0.3 ~ eV and mνμ  ≥  (1.8  ÷  2.2)  ·  10- 5 ~ eV;

for case D, the ESH analysis gives too high values for neutrino masses, while the lower limit one gets on mνμ in the general case, namely mνμ  ≥  (2  ÷  6)  ·  10- 3 ~ eV, is just of the right order of magnitude to allow for a solution of solar neutrino problems in the framework of MSW model. The results on τ neutrino, mντ  ≥  25  ÷  75 ~ eV, are quite large, though the smallest one is still marginally compatible with analysis on dark matter composition and perturbation spectra. Moreover, in this case, we have shown how baryon asymmetry can be efficiently produced by combining B - L violating processes at high scales and sphaleronic effects at low scales, with a result for ηB which is in agreement with data from primordial nucleosynthesis.

It is worth stressing, to conclude, the strong uncertainties on these predictions coming from the corresponding ones on the gauge couplings at MZ, as can be seen from Figure 1.

Table II

The values of MX and MR in the case sin 2θW  =  0.2315  ±  0.0002 and αs = 0.123  ±  0.004. When MX is less than the lower limit we omit to write the upper limit on MR.

The same as Table II but with [formula] and [formula]

The figure shows the curves of level at MR = 109,1010,1011,1012,5.4  ·  1013  ~  GeV for the models of Table I. The star indicates the value [formula]. Note that in case A only the upper value appears in the figure because the others are too high.
