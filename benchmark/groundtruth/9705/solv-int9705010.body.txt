Integrability of Riccati equations and the stationary KdV equations

In this paper we will suggest a method for integrating a one-parameter family of the Riccati equations

[formula]

based on their Lie symmetries. Here

[formula]

and λ is an arbitrary real parameter.

We recall the principal idea of application of Lie group methods to integrating the Riccati equation ([\ref=ric]). Suppose it admits a one-parameter transformation group having the infinitesimal operator

[formula]

Then making a change of variables (x,u) →   (,ũ) transforming X to become [formula] (which is always possible) reduces the equation under study to an ordinary differential equation not containing the independent variable [formula] (for more details, see, for example, [\cite=olv] [\cite=ovs]). The latter is evidently integrable by quadratures which provides integrability of the initial differential equation. Lie's invariance criterion for the Riccati equation ([\ref=ric]) to admit a one-parameter group having the infinitesimal operator X yields the following determining equation for ξ,η:

[formula]

However integrating the above equation is by no means easier than integrating the initial equation ([\ref=ric]). This makes an application of the Lie's infinitesimal method in its full generality inefficient. One should make some additional guesses about a structure of the operator X enabling to simplify the determining equation. Our idea is to use a special Ansatz for the coefficients of the inifinitesimal operator

[formula]

where a,b,c are polynomials in λ.

Inserting these expressions into the determining equation and splitting with respect to u yield

[formula]

Hereafter the prime denotes differentiation with respect to x.

From ([\ref=eq1]), ([\ref=eq2]) it follows that

[formula]

Substituting these expressions into ([\ref=eq3]) gives

[formula]

Now we fix the following form of an unknown function a(x,λ) (see, also [\cite=zhd])

[formula]

In what follows we will restrict our considerations to two cases

n is arbitrary and N = 1,

N is arbitrary and n = 1.

First, we consider the case N = 1. Inserting a(x,λ) = λ  +  A(x) into ([\ref=red]) and splitting with respect to the powers of λ yield

[formula]

Solving the above recurrent relations ([\ref=rec]) we get the following expressions for Vj:

[formula]

Here [formula] are arbitrary real constants, [formula] and V = V(x) is a solution of the third-order ODE:

[formula]

The above equation is evidently integrated by quadratures which means that given the conditions ([\ref=gen]), ([\ref=gkdv]) the Riccati equation ([\ref=ric]) is integrable by quadratures. Note that the equation ([\ref=gkdv]) with [formula] and n = 1 is nothing else than the standard stationary KdV equation

[formula]

Choosing [formula] and n = 2 yields the stationary modified KdV equation

[formula]

Now we will turn to the case of an arbitrary N with n = 1. With this choice of N,n equation ([\ref=red]) takes the form

[formula]

with An = 1. Splitting the above equality with respect to the powers of λ yields recurrent relations for Aj

[formula]

with [formula].

The first N relations of ([\ref=rkdv]) are solved by subsequent integrations yielding the expressions for the functions [formula] via the function V0(x) and its derivatives. Substituting these results into the last equation (j = 0) we arrive at nonlinear ordinary differential equation for the function V0(x). To reveal the structure of the equation in question we introduce the new functions U0(x), U1(x),[formula] by the following recurrence relation:

[formula]

where [formula].

Being so determined the functions Uj(x) are easily recognized to be the conserved densities for the KdV equation. Furthermore, the integro-differential operator R is the recursion operator whose repeated action on some initial conserved density yields the whole hierarchy of the conserved densities for the KdV equation (for more details on recursive operators for the KdV equation, see e.g. [\cite=olv] [\cite=ibr] [\cite=abl]).

Now we can solve the first N relations of ([\ref=rkdv]) in terms of the functions Uj(x)

[formula]

where [formula] are integration constants.

As [formula], the last equation from ([\ref=rkdv]) can be rewritten to become

[formula]

or, equivalently,

[formula]

where [formula]. In what follows we will show that this equation is nothing else than the stationary higher KdV equation. To this end we will need the following operator identity:

[formula]

The integro-differential operator

[formula]

is the second recursion operator for the KdV equation. Acting repeatedly with P on some initial symmetry (say [formula]) yields the whole hierarchy of higher symmetries of the KdV equation [formula], where

[formula]

In view of the above facts we can represent equation ([\ref=last]) in the following form:

[formula]

Taking into account the fact that [formula] we get finally

[formula]

which is the standard form of the stationary higher KdV equation. Provided N = 1, it coincides with the stationary KdV equation ([\ref=kdv]).

As the stationary higher KdV equations are integrable [\cite=nov], the initial Riccati equation ([\ref=ric]) with N = 1 is integrable by quadratures provided V(x) is a solution of one of the equations of the stationary KdV hierarchy.
