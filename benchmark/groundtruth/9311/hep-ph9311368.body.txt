ABSTRACT

A new Monte Carlo model is proposed for radiative corrections to Bhabha scattering by extending QEDPS developed for multi-photon emission in muon pair production in e+e- annihilation. This is the QED version of the model known as parton shower in QCD. The main difference between muon pair production and Bhabha scattering is that the latter cross section shows the singularity of 1 / t2. A shower algorithm is constructed on the radiator formalism modified in a suitable form for this singularity. Some results of the model are presented and compared with O(α) corrections.

Section 1 Introduction

It has become a common understanding that detailed theoretical predictions for e+e- experiments should include the radiative corrections with multi-photon contribution. A well known example is the significant modification of the apparent cross section around the Z-boson pole at LEP[\cite=lep]. The study of inclusive processes with multi-photon emission has led some authors to propose several kinds of Monte Carlo generators[\cite=yfs].

In a previous paper[\cite=qedps] we have reported a new method for the Monte Carlo generator of multi-photon and have shown some results obtained by a computer program written for muon pair production in e+e- annihilation. This is the QED version of the parton shower model which has been studied extensively in QCD. In this paper we generalize this method to the Bhabha scattering by employing essentially the same algorithm as that for muon pair production.

It will be convenient to describe again the main features of the algorithm to generate photons. We rely on the technique to sum up all the collinear singularities, which plays an essential role in the parton shower model[\cite=ps]. The present model is limited to the leading logarithmic approximation, though there is no difficulty in principle to include the next-to-leading corrections[\cite=nll]. This approximation is reasonable as the QED coupling α is very small compared with that in QCD. Another remarkable feature is that the transverse momentum distribution of produced photons is derived correctly once one imposes the four-momentum conservation at each of branching vertices[\cite=ps]. This is a consequence of the branching, e±  →  e±γ, being a process of [formula] bodies.

The main difference between muon pair production and Bhabha scattering lies in the fact that the cross section for the latter is dominated by the forward scattering, while for the former it has more or less flat angular dependence over the whole range of the scattering angle.

We will discuss the modification necessary to take into account this difference in the next section. In section 3 some numerical results will be presented, where comparison is made with exact calculation in the order α. Also we will show the cross section for the production of e+e-γγ, which recently attracted some interests in connection with the L3 events[\cite=L3]. Final section is devoted to conclusions and discussions.

Section 2 Bhabha Scattering

The radiator formalism plays the key role in applying the shower algorithm to an exclusive process[\cite=qedps]. In the case of muon pair production in e+e- annihilation, it tells us that the cross section is given by the following form[\cite=suppl] ,

[formula]

The function De-(e+)(x,s) is the electron(positron) structure function and it represents the probability distribution for finding an electron(positron) of momentum fraction x = p / E in the reaction at s. Here the beam energy is denoted as E and the square of the center-of-mass energy is s = 4E2.

To extend the radiator formalism to Bhabha scattering we propose the following equation:

[formula]

Here dσBorn / dp2t is the Born differential cross section with p2t being the transverse momentum squared of a jet, which consists of an electron(positron) and any number of accompanying photons collinear with it, as depicted in Fig.1. At the hard scattering, p2t is defined by the scattered electron with respect to the initial electron. It should be noted that the allowed range for p2t is

[formula]

One may think that one could use instead the cross section dσBorn / dt, where t is the square of momentum transfer. This is, however, not correct choice, because the parton shower model must be formulated in terms of the longitudinal and the transverse momentum component. That is, there is a specified direction and coordinate frame in which the model is constructed. The invariant t looses any preferred direction, and thus an inadequate variable to be used. In Eq.(2) we put the structure functions of initial e+ and e-, but drop those for final e±. This is legitimate by the fact that the final photons are integrated over the whole phase space so that there remains neither collinear nor soft singularity in contrast to the initial e±. In the actual generation of events, photons are emitted from the final e± as well as from the initial ones, because generated events correspond to exclusive process.

Comparing these two equations, one will immediately find two differences; first the former is related with the total cross section, but the latter with the differential cross section. The second is the energy scale entering into the structure function. If we apply Eq.([\ref=eq:st2]) to muon pair production, it simply reduces to Eq.([\ref=eq:st1]) in the leading-logarithmic approximation. This can be seen as follows; for this process the differential cross section is a smooth function of p2t. This allows one to make an approximation D(x,p2t)  ~  D(x,s). Then integrating over p2t, one gets Eq.(1). The Eq.(2) is the basic relation in this work. Thanks to this we can develop an algorithm to generate multi-photons in Bhabha scattering.

For radiation of photons from leptons(e+ and e-) we can apply the same algorithm as that in the previous work[\cite=qedps]. We introduce the probability for non-branching by

[formula]

Here ΠNB(K21,K22) represents such a probability that the lepton does not branch when its virtual mass squared decreases from - K22 to - K21. More rigorously it corresponds to a process of radiating infinite number of soft photons with an energy fraction less than 1 - x+ through which electron changes its transverse momentum. The latter can be further replaced to the electron virtuality K2 in the approximation considered. The contribution form loops are also contained in this function. The running coupling is denoted as α(K2). Having this probability, one can determine whether a lepton branches into a lepton and a photon or not. The P-function in Eq.([\ref=eq:pfun]) is used to fix the momentum fraction. The precise definition of x must be given by introducing the fraction of the light-cone momentum. To make the branching to proceed in an independent way for each lepton, it is convenient to employ the double-cascade scheme studied in Ref.[\cite=double].

Two differences in Eqs.([\ref=eq:st1]) and ([\ref=eq:st2]), the arguments of the structure functions and the basic cross sections, affect the model in the following points: the maximum value of the virtual mass squared for each lepton and the way to accept generated events. In the annihilation process the maximum of the virtual mass squared is s. After the radiation of photons, we know the momenta of electron and positron and are able to calculate the effective total energy squared(s') of the hard scattering. Then we decide to accept the generated event or not by hit-or-miss method comparing a random number and the ratio between σ(s') and the maximum cross section σ0 in the energy region interested. These procedures are justified by Eq.([\ref=eq:st1])[\cite=suppl].

In the case of Bhabha scattering, however, this manner should be somewhat changed. At the beginning we have to determine the transverse momentum squared p2t of the process according to a probability function; it may be given by some reference cross section dσ0 / dp2t, which does not correspond to any realistic process but is fictitious one(see below). Once p2t is fixed it is adopted as the maximum value of the absolute value of the squared virtual mass of electron and positron. Then we allow both of electrons to radiate photons. After the radiations we have a definite total energy of the e+e- system, which initiates the hard scattering. Finally we determine whether the event is accepted or not by making the hit-or-miss for the ratio of cross sections dσ / dp2t(s') and dσBorn / dp2t.

Next we shall elaborate the above arguments. We limit ourselves to QED interaction only for the sake of simplicity; it is an easy task to include the weak interaction. The Born cross section of Bhabha scattering with photon exchange in s- and t-channel is then given by

[formula]

with

[formula]

Here we introduce the running coupling constant α(p2t) in order to include the vacuum polarization, which gives rise to a non-negligible correction as we shall see later. It should be noted that the coupling α is multiplied as an overall factor and its argument is not t but p2t. This choice of argument assures that it behaves like α(t) for the forward scattering while like α(s) when s-channel is dominant(recall the discussion that Eq.(2) reduces to Eq.(1) when integrated over p2t). Thus the overall multiplication can deal with both extreme cases.

The first step of the Monte Carlo generation is to determine p2t according to the probability given by the following reference cross section

[formula]

Note that we choose the form which is dependent only on p2t but not on s.

For a given p2t we make a shower for incoming electron and positron. After the evolution of each lepton, with p2t being the maximum virtuality, four-momenta of the leptons are fixed and the center-of-mass energy squared s' is obtained. As explained in Ref.[\cite=qedps], the transverse momentum of an emitted photon kt is limited by k2t < p2t. Then we decide to accept this event or not according to the ratio of the cross sections given by Eq.([\ref=eq:bha1]) and Eq.([\ref=eq:tent]). Also we have to determine t by the ratio between dσ / dt1 and dσ / dt2.

Once the event is accepted, we proceed to the next step to make a shower for scattered leptons starting with the maximum virtuality p2t. When the showers are completed for all leptons we know the four-momenta of all these particles. Then the hard scattering is assumed to take place among the on-mass-shell leptons neglecting their virtuality, and the scattering angle is calculated by the Born cross section.

We make a comment on the reference cross section Eq.([\ref=eq:tent]). This is not always greater than the true cross section, particularly when the Z-pole is included. If this happens, we cannot use a naive hit-or-miss method, but have to generate events with weights. In this case we equate the ratio of two cross sections to the weight of that event.

Section 3 Results

We will present some results of our Monte Carlo model. We include the contribution from Z-boson exchange into the Born cross section. The center-of-mass energy is fixed at 58 GeV, the central energy of TRISTAN. The cutoff mass Q0 for photon is assumed to be 0.1 MeV. Other parameters used in the numerical calculation are MZ = 91.17 GeV, ΓZ = 2.487 GeV, and MW = 80.20 GeV for heavy bosons.

First we show in Fig.2 the differential cross section over p2t. We compare the generated events with the result obtained from Eq.([\ref=eq:st2]), using the analytic formula for the structure function given by Eq.(11) in Ref.[\cite=qedps]. One can see that a good agreement is achieved, which in turn demonstrates the consistency of the model.

Next we compare the results of the model with O(α) calculation[\cite=tobi]. In making comparison we impose some experimental cuts. The electron and positron are assumed to be scattered in a limited region of θ, the polar angle measured from the beam axis. The following cuts for the acollinearity angle and the threshold energy for final positron and electron are introduced: [formula] and Eth = 1 GeV, respectively. In addition the energy cut to separate hard and soft process is taken to be 0.5 GeV. This is necessary to calculate the cross section in the fixed order of α. Needless to say the vacuum polarization is included in this calculation, which corresponds to the running coupling α(p2t) in the shower model. We also compare them with ALIBABA[\cite=alibaba], which cannot generate events but is able to calculate the large-angle Bhabha scattering. This contains the summation of the leading log terms by using the structure function method for differential cross section together with no-log terms of O(α). Table 1 summarizes the total cross sections obtained from generated events, O(α) calculation and ALIBABA with cuts mentioned. ALIBABA-1/-2 means the results using ALIBABA without/with no-log terms. ALIBABA cannot provide the answer in the case of [formula]. The results of our model agree well with ALIBABA-1 as expected. Even in the case of the large angle scattering, [formula], results of QEDPS model are consistent with ALIBABA-2 in 1%.

The Fig.3 shows the energy distribution of the electron. One can see some discrepancy in the region [formula] between O(α) calculation and the Monte Carlo model. This reflects the fact that the multi-photon radiations cannot be neglected in this region. A similar situation was also found in the case of muon pair production[\cite=qedps].

One remarkable feature of the present model is that the transverse momentum of radiated photons can be dealt with in a reliable way. This fact was discussed in detail in the previous paper[\cite=qedps] by making a comparison with O(α2) corrections. It will be interesting to see the distribution of the transverse momentum carried by photons in Bhabha scattering. It is, more precisely, equivalent to the transverse momentum balanced to the final positron and electron. The result is presented in Fig.4. We find that O(α) calculation and the model give almost the same results except the region where the soft photon contribution is significant. These results demonstrate that multi-photon radiation is very important and cannot be ignored in the detailed study of Bhabha scattering.

Finally we show the cross section of the L3 events[\cite=L3], i.e., e+e-  →  e+e-γγ, by the present model. The same parameters as in Ref.[\cite=grace] are used. The cross section is [formula] pb, and if restricted in the high mass region, Mγγ > 50 GeV, it is [formula] pb. These results are consistent with those of other calculations[\cite=grace].

Section 4 Conclusions and discussions

We formulated a new Mote Carlo model for radiative corrections in Bhabha scattering. This is a natural extension of QEDPS developed in the previous paper for muon pair production in e+e- annihilation. These Monte Carlo models are precisely in parallelism with QCD parton shower. Only the differences are the strengths of coupling and non-existence of the self-couplings for the photon. The raditor formalism should be modified for Bhabha scattering in such a way that the structure functions are combined with the differential cross section with respect to p2t of electron or positron jet. An advantage of our model is that the photons can be radiated from the final state as well as from the initial state, though the interference of these two radiations is not taken into account at the moment.

We made comparison of the model with O(α) calculation and found that the multi-photon radiation is sizeable in the soft photon part. It should be emphasized that the model can be applied to both regions of small scattering angle and of central region. The only restriction imposed by the model is that the generated events must be such that the transverse momentum of any photon with respect to leptons which emit the photons is smaller than that of final electron or positron, k2t < p2t. This implies that these events look like Bhabha scattering. In other words we cannot generate Compton-like events in which either of electron or positron is scattered in the forward region while photons are radiated with large transverse momentum. In principle it is not so difficult task to implement this kind of events into the model, but some technical development is required to complete the unified treatment.
