The study of zeros of partition functions, initiated by Yang and Lee, provides an important qualitative and quantitative tool in the study of critical phenomena. This has frequently been used for periodic as well as hierarchical lattices. Here, we consider magnetic field and temperature zeros of Ising model partition functions on several aperiodic structures. In 1D, we analyze aperiodic chains obtained from substitution rules, the most prominent example being the Fibonacci chain. In 2D, we focus on the tenfold symmetric triangular tiling which allows efficient numerical treatment by means of corner transfer matrices.

Introduction

The study of critical phenomena by means of discrete spin systems, initiated by Lenz and Ising [\cite=Ising], finally came of age by Onsager's spectacular solution of the 2D field-free Ising model [\cite=Onsager]. He could show that the 2D Ising model on the square lattice with ferromagnetic nearest neighbour interaction exhibits an order-disorder phase transition of second order at finite temperature with the magnetization as order parameter.

The investigation of many other spin systems followed, as did the consideration of Ising-type models on other lattices and graphs. Some cases can still be solved exactly, compare [\cite=Baxter], but this is an exception. Consequently, one needs complementary methods to tackle questions like existence and location of critical points and estimation of critical exponents, especially in higher dimensions. One such technique is provided by the work of Lee and Yang [\cite=YangLee] [\cite=LeeYang], who investigated the distribution of partition function zeros in the complex plane, i.e., field variables or fugacity were treated as a complex parameter. Later, also the zeros in the complex temperature variable were studied for various systems [\cite=Fisher] [\cite=Jones] [\cite=ItzykLuck] [\cite=Carmelo]. These not only provide information about the location of phase boundaries but also about critical exponents, see e.g. [\cite=ItzykLuck] where mainly hierarchical lattices are considered. For those, the zero patterns form fractal structures known as Julia sets whereas they are usually expected to lie on simple curves for regular lattices, at least in the isotropic case. It has been shown [\cite=StephConz] [\cite=vSaarKurtz] that for anisotropic Ising models on two-dimensional regular lattices the temperature zeros generically fill areas in the complex plane.

But what does "simple curves" mean? As we will show in a shortwhile, already the Ising model on a modulated structure in 1D can result in magnetic field zeros which do lie on a simple curve, but occupy only a Cantor-like portion of it - even in the thermodynamic limit! Although the corresponding phenomenon in 2D does not typically show up (or at least not that we could conclude so), the investigation of partition function zeros for spin systems on non-periodic graphs with deflation/inflation symmetry might fill the gap between the relatively well studied cases of lattices and hierarchical graphs. This is the major motivation for the present article, where we discuss the Ising model on quasiperiodic graphs in 1D and 2D.

Non-periodic 1D Ising model

Let us consider a one-dimensional chain of N Ising spins σj∈{  ±  1}, [formula], with periodic boundary conditions (i.e., σN + 1   =   σ1). The energy of a configuration [formula] is given by

[formula]

Here, we concentrate on systems where the coupling constants Jj,j + 1 can only take two different values Jj,j + 1∈{Ja,Jb} and where the magnetic field is constant, i.e. [formula]. The actual distribution of the two coupling constants Ja and Jb along the chain is determined by an infinite word in the letters a and b which is obtained as the unique limit of certain two letter substitution rules, see [\cite=BGJ]. In fact, we restrict ourselves to the Fibonacci case which corresponds to the substitution rule

[formula]

The length of the word wn = S(wn - 1) obtained by n iterations from the initial word w0 = a is fn + 1, where the Fibonacci numbers fn are defined by

[formula]

Let us introduce the following notation

[formula]

and

[formula]

The two elementary transfer matrices Ta and Tb now read as follows

[formula]

and, in general, do not commute with each other.

The recursive definition of the sequence gives rise to a recurrence formula for the transfer matrices

[formula]

where Tn denotes the transfer matrix of the chain that corresponds to the n-th iteration step. Hence the partition function Zn(za,zb,w) = (Tn) is essentially (i.e., up to an overall factor) a polynomial in its three variables. It is also possible to write down a recurrence relation for the partition function itself, see [\cite=BGJ] for details. In this way, it is really easy to generate the partition function for very large systems exactly (e.g., by means of algebraic manipulation packages). Our problem at hand has thus been reduced to the task of computing the roots of a polynomial.

Let us have a look at the pattern of zeros of the partition functions Zn(za,zb,w) in the field variable w. If both couplings are ferromagnetic (za  ≥  1, zb  ≥  1), the zeros lie on the unit circle. For purely anti-ferromagnetic coupling, (za  ≤  1, zb  ≤  1), they are on the imaginary axis whereas the "mixed" case turns out to be complicated and will not be discussed here.

For simplicity, we will, from now on, stick to the purely ferromagnetic regime. If the chain were periodic, the zeros would be distributed homogeneously on the unit circle (they can be calculated analytically). In the thermodynamic limit, they fill the circle densely except near the point (1,0) on the real axis, where we are left with a gap since we do not have a phase transition at finite temperature (i.e., for 0  <  T  <    ∞  ). One might perhaps expect the very same situation in the Fibonacci case, but the latter is always good for a surprise.

In Fig. 1, we show the location of the zeros of Zn(za,zb,w) in the complex w-plane for ferromagnetic couplings za = 3 / 2, zb = 100 (which corresponds to Ka  ≈  0.203 and Kb  ≈  2.306) and n = 8,9,10. As expected, the zeros are clearly located on the unit circle, and there is still a large gap near (1,0) as it must be because we still cannot have a phase transition at finite temperature. However, an additional gap structure in the distribution of the zeros on the unit circle is apparent. It turns out that this gap structure does not depend on the actual values of the coupling constants (as long as they are still ferromagnetic), just the gap widths change and the gaps vanish if za and zb become equal which of course corresponds to the periodic case. The large difference between the two couplings used in our pictures was chosen to show the effect clearly - for a small difference one might miss it, though it is still there!

In Fig. 2, we present the integrated density of the zeros on the unit circle (i.e., the integrated density of their angles (in units of 2π) with respect to the real axis) for the same set of parameter values as in Fig. 1. It turns out that this has exactly the structure which one would expect from the general gap labeling theorem of Bellissard and coworkers [\cite=Belli86] [\cite=BelliBovGhez92] [\cite=BGJ] which however applies to the integrated density of states (IDOS) of energy spectra of certain discrete Hamiltonians. There, the limit set of the IDOS values at the gaps has the form (see [\cite=BGJ] and references therein)

[formula]

for the Fibonacci case, where [formula] is the golden ratio. The widest gaps in Fig. 2 have been labeled with the corresponding indices (μ,ν) which for the finite system belong to the rational values

[formula]

of the integrated density. Note that any two successive Fibonacci numbers fn - 1 and fn are coprime, hence every integer can be written as a linear combination of them with integral coefficients. Generically, it appears that at all the "allowed" values one actually observes gaps in the density distribution, i.e., "all gaps are open". The obvious symmetry in the pictures which relates the gaps with labels (μ,ν) and (1 - μ,1 - ν) stems from the reflection symmetry of the zero pattern with respect to the real axis which corresponds to a change of the sign in the magnetic field h.

Admittedly, we did not present a rigorous argument which explains why the gap labeling theorem for the IDOS of one-dimensional Schödinger operators [\cite=Belli86] [\cite=BelliBovGhez92] [\cite=BGJ] describes the distributions of our partition function zeros on the unit circle. However, the agreement is certainly convincing and suggests to think of the zeros (or rather of their arguments) as the eigenvalues of a Schrödinger type operator. This is also one relatively easy way to prove the Lee-Yang circle theorem (or the corresponding "line theorem" in the antiferromagnetic case) for the periodic 1D Ising model. In this context, we also mention an old idea of Hilbert's, namely the possible connection between the imaginary parts of the (non-trivial) zeros of the Riemann ζ-function and the eigenvalues of a - so far unknown - hermitian Hamiltonian. This has recently also been linked to some typical aspects of quantum chaos, see [\cite=Berry] and references therein.

Ising model on the triangle tiling

The 1D case was presented for two main reasons. On the one hand, calculations are either possible analytically or can be made rigorous. On the other hand, a new phenomenon - the appearance of gaps - could be seen.

Nevertheless, investigations of Ising models on graphs of higher dimension are in order. If one is not interested in approximative calculations (which we are not), one encounters true difficulties on the non-periodic ground. Even the existence of local deflation/inflation symmetry does not seem to allow exact renormalization schemes for electronic models, compare [\cite=Sire90] [\cite=You92], and we were not able so far to find one for Ising type models, either.

So, the best thing one can then do is the exact calculation of the partition sum for finite patches, followed by a numerical approach of the thermodynamic limit. Even this is a difficult task which requires a good choice of the graph, i.e., the non-periodic tiling. From our experience with Ising quantum chains in 1D [\cite=GB93] - which can be seen as anisotropic limits of 2D classical systems - we decided to take a quasiperiodic example in order to stay free of effects caused by uncontrollable fluctuations.

The triangle pattern developed in Tübingen [\cite=triangle1] [\cite=triangle2] [\cite=triangle3] has the advantage that we can start from a patch with decagonal boundary that is - in a natural way - partitioned into sectors, each covering an angle of 2π  /  10, compare Fig. 3. This structure suggests the use of corner transfer matrices, compare [\cite=Baxter], to calculate the partition sum and the magnetization at the centre of the patch. However, the patch is not a repetition of ten equal sectors, wherefore we cannot reduce the problem to the CTM of one single sector. On the other hand, the CTM's of sectors of opposite orientation (indicated by the arrow in the inital patch) are the transposed matrices of each other. Giving those spins half weight which lie on the boundaries of the sectors, we can obtain the partition function as

[formula]

This can then be evaluated again by algebraic manipulation packages.

In what follows, we use the same notation as in the Fibonacci case above but with indices s (for short) and [formula] (for long) in place of a and b. In particular, we also assume that the magnetic field is uniform. Here, [formula] now denotes the partition function of the Ising model on the patch which is obtained by n deflation steps (see Fig. 4) from the initial decagonal patch shown in Fig. 3 (which corresponds to n = 0). It is impossible to define periodic boundary conditions on our tiling without destroying the tenfold symmetry and the sector structure, wherefore we either use fixed boundary conditions (i.e., all spins on the decagonal boundary of the patch are frozen to be + 1) or free boundary conditions (i.e., we sum over all values of the boundary spins).

For fixed boundary conditions, the zeros of the partition function [formula] (for finite n) in the field variable w are no longer located on the unit circle, as this case (in contrast to the free boundary case) is not covered by the circle theorem of Lee and Yang [\cite=LeeYang]. This is clearly seen in Fig. 6 which shows the locations of the zeros in the complex w-plane for couplings [formula] and three different patch sizes. It is plausible that the zeros approach the unit circle in the thermodynamic limit. However, the angular distribution of the zeros is remarkably regular, there is no apparent gap structure as in the one-dimensional case. We also computed the zeros for different couplings zs and [formula] for fixed and free boundary conditions which show the same behaviour.

Let us also have a look at the zeros in the other variables. Here, we restrict ourselves to the zero-field partition function [formula] and use fixed boundary conditions. For the "isotropic" case [formula], the zeros of Z3(z,z,1) in the variable z are shown in Fig. 7. Although the distribution of the zeros in the complex z plane is apparently not simple (i.e., the zeros do not appear to lie on simple curves), the zeros close to the real axis contain information about the location of the critical point and, in principle, also about the critical exponents [\cite=ItzykLuck]. In Table 1, we give the numerical values of the zero closest to the real line with a real part greater than one for the following five choices of [formula]: (1,z), (z,z2), (z,z), (z2,z), and (z,1), i.e., in addition to the "isotropic" case we look at those cases where one of the coupling constants vanishes and where one coupling constant is twice as large as the other.

The approximants for the critical couplings are in good agreement with our values obtained from the behaviour of the specific heat and the centre spin magnetization of the model (with the exception of [formula] where the centre spin is isolated), but we omit details here. Let us only remark that the nature of the critical point looks very much like that of the periodic case though further calculations are needed to approve that.

Concluding Remarks

The distribution of partition function zeros on the unit circle shows a gap structure for ferromagnetic Ising models on aperiodic chains. Although we have only demonstrated this phenomenon for the ubiquitious Fibonacci chain, one can translate each step to any of the other chains obtained by substitution rules - no matter whether one restricts oneself to the two-letter case or not.

The 2D case did not show any apparent gap structure for the magnetic field zeros (and thus resembles the situation of the electronic spectra again). The partition function zeros in the temperature variable do not seem to lie on simple curves, even in the "isotropic" case where the couplings for short and long bonds are identical - more work is to be done to clarify this point. On the other hand, one can clearly see the existence of a phase transition because the zeros "pinch" the real axis. For given (finite) coupling constants, the critical point has finite Tc.

Now, looking at the limiting cases zs = 1 or [formula], one gets the impression that Tc heads to 0, quite similarly as in the case of the square lattice [\cite=Baxter]. However, the corresponding graph with one type of bonds "switched off" is by no means one-dimensional (or at least not in an obvious way) - wherefore the question arises what this means. To clear this up, one should treat first a model where the location of the critical point can be found exactly, without numerical estimates. This is indeed possible for another quasiperiodic pattern, the so-called Labyrinth tiling. The same phenomenom occurs there, and we will discuss details elsewhere [\cite=Laby].
