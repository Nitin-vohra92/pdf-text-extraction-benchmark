Multicanonical Potts Model Simulation1

Abstract:

Relying on the recently proposed multicanonical algorithm, we present a numerical simulation of the first order phase transition in the 2d 10-state Potts model on lattices up to sizes 100  ×  100. It is demonstrated that the new algorithm lacks an exponentially fast increase of the tunneling time between metastable states as a function of the linear size L of the system. Instead, the tunneling time diverges approximately proportional to L2.65. Thus the computational effort as counted per degree of freedom for generating an independent configuration in the unstable region of the model rises proportional to V2.3, where V is the volume of the system. On our largest lattice we gain more than two orders of magnitude as compared to a standard heat bath algorithm. As a first physical application we report a high precision computation of the interfacial tension.

Critical slowing down is of crucial importance to computer simulations of phase transitions. For second order phase transitions long autocorrelation times at criticality cause severe restrictions on the maximum lattice size for which one can obtain good statistics of thermodynamic quantities. For a number of spin systems this critical slowing down was overcome by the nonlocal cluster algorithm of Swendsen-Wang [\cite=SweWa], for a recent review see [\cite=SweWa2]. However, for first order transition one encounters an even worse and different problem of critical slowing down. The interfacial free energy between disordered and ordered states has a finite value on the critical point for the infinite volume system. Configurations dominated by the presence of the interface will be exponentially suppressed by the Boltzmann factor in the canonical ensemble. On finite lattices this leads then to an exponentially fast suppression of the tunneling between metastable states of the system with increasing lattice size. To overcome this critical slowing down effect for first order transitions, we recently proposed a multicanonical Monte Carlo algorithm [\cite=our]. The multicanonical MC algorithm is designed to enhance configurations, which are dominated by the presence of the interface and therefore exponentially suppressed. In this way it is possible to avoid the exponentially fast growing slowing down at the first order phase transition. In this paper we demonstrate this in the case of our example: the 2d 10-state Potts model.

The 2d 10-state Potts model [\cite=Potts] is defined by the partition function

[formula]

Recently there has been renewed interest in this model [\cite=Bill] [\cite=Lee] [\cite=Borgs]. It serves as an excellent laboratory for finite size scaling (FSS) studies of temperature driven strong first order phase transitions. We have chosen this model as the first testing ground for our new method by, essentially, two reasons: a) it has a strong first order transition and this is the situation for which our method promises the most dramatic improvements, and b) accurate data, due to recent large scale simulations [\cite=Bill] [\cite=Borgs], exist in the literature. Beyond these reasons, an accurate determination of the interfacial free energy is certainly also of physical interest.

To calculate the interfacial free energy Fs between the disordered and the (ten) ordered states has remained the hardest problem. The reason is the pronounced double peak structure of the sampled action density PL(S) in the canonical ensemble near the critical point, as illustrated in Fig. 1 for lattices of size V = L2 with L = 24 and L = 100. The figure relies on data obtained with the multicanonical MC algorithm to be discussed in this paper, and is arranged to correspond to the action density of the canonical ensemble at β  =  βcL. The pseudocritical point βcL is defined such that both maxima are of equal height:

[formula]

In addition we have imposed the normalization condition 1 = P1, maxL = P2, maxL. Fig. 2 depicts the action densities for lattices with L = 16,24,34,50,70 and L = 100 on a logarithmic scale and we see that 4 orders of magnitude are involved: PminL / PmaxL≃5.1  ×  10- 5 for L = 100. With our conventions for PL(S) the interfacial free energy Fs = Fs∞ can now be defined [\cite=face] as the L  →    ∞   limit of the quantity

[formula]

For a numerical calculation of FsL it is now clear that any algorithm which samples configurations with a probability ~  PL(S) would slow down proportional to 1 / PminL. As for large lattices PminL  ~   exp ( - FsLd - 1), it is expected that an appropriately defined tunneling time τtL will behave as

[formula]

The parameters Aτ and α can in principal be determined by a fit to the measured tunneling times.

The multicanonical MC algorithm samples configurations with the weight

[formula]

instead of sampling with the usual Boltzmann factor PBL(S)  ~   exp (βcLS) corresponding to the canonical ensemble. Here we partitioned the total action interval 0  ≤  S  ≤  2V into k = 0,...,N (N odd) intervals Ik = (SkL,Sk + 1L]. The idea of the multicanonical MC algorithm is to choose intervals Ik and values of βkL and αkL at the pseudocritical point βcL in such a way, that the resulting multicanonical action density PL(S) has a approximately flat behavior for values of the action in the interval

defines the multicanonical ensemble. In accordance with detailed balance, standard Metropolis and heat bath updating algorithms have been generalized to the multicanonical situation [\cite=our] [\cite=Bau]. Finally we obtain the canonical action density distribution PL(S) through a reweighting step similar to [\cite=FS] [\cite=BauBer] from the multicanonical distribution PL(S):

[formula]

As an example we show for our L = 70 system in Fig. 3 the multicanonical action density distribution P70(S) together with the reweighted distribution P70(S). In practice the appropriate choice of the parameters in eq. (7) is obtained by making from the given systems a FSS prediction of the density distribution PL(S) for the next larger system. A second run may then be performed with optimized parameters. It is our experience that the guess works normally so well that the second run is barely an improvement as compared with the first. On the smallest systems standard MC simulation provides initial data. Our statistics for this investigation was 4  ·  106 heat bath sweeps per run and lattice size. One sweep updates each spin of the lattice once.

We define the tunneling time τtL as the average number of sweeps needed to get from a configuration with action S = S1, maxL to a configuration with S = S2, maxL and back. With our statistics of 4  ·  106 sweeps per run the system tunnels then in total 8  ·  106  /  τtL times. Table 1. collects the measured tunneling times. For our smaller systems we have also carried out standard heat bath MC runs at βcL and the associated tunneling times are also reported in Table 1. For the larger systems standard MC runs would not tunnel often enough to allow for a reliable direct calculation of their tunneling times. This is of course due to the exponential slowing down of the standard MC simulation. In Fig. 4 we display on a log to log scale the divergence of the tunneling times τtL for the multicanonical MC algorithm (circles) and the heat bath algorithm (triangles). There is clearly a different behavior of the two algorithms involved. While for the multicanonical MC algorithm the increase of the tunneling time is consistent with a power law, the heat bath algorithm displays an exponentially fast growing tunneling time. Performing a χ2  -  fit we obtain the following fits

[formula]

The quality of the fits as indicated by the χ2 values (nF - 1 denotes the number of degrees of freedom minus one) is reasonable. In case of the heat bath algorithm we could not reliably determine the errors from a 3 parameter fit. The ratio R   =   τtL(heatbath) ~  /  ~ τtL(multicanonical) is a direct measure for the relative efficiency of the two algorithms. Using the fits we extrapolate its value to the L = 100 system and estimate a factor R  ≈  500 for this case. The multicanonical algorithm approximately slows down like ~  V2.325 with respect to the number of updates per degree of freedom. This is only slightly worse than the optimal performance ~  V2 which was estimated in [\cite=our] based on a random walk picture. For the heat bath algorithm the inefficiency of the algorithm prohibits a very accurate estimate of Fs from the behavior of the tunneling time according to eq. (6). The fitted value in eq. (11) is however close to the determination of the next paragraph (eq. (15)).

Our multicanonical data allow the so far most precise determination of the interfacial free energy for the 2d 10-state Potts model. For this purpose we determine maxima and minima of the PL(S) distributions by self-consistent straight line fits over suitable S-ranges. Together with the central values of their associated ranges, our FsL values are collected in Table 2. Performing the FSS fit according to [\cite=face]

[formula]

we obtain consistent results for lattices of size L = 16,24,34,50,70 and L = 100, as displayed in Fig. 5 (we have χ2 / (nF - 1) = 0.27). We estimate the infinite volume value of the interfacial free energy to be

[formula]

This value may however depend weakly on the analytical form of the FSS fit [\cite=face] and even with our large lattices we may still face additional systematic errors of a similar order than the quoted statistical error. Future simulations on even larger lattice sizes might therefore be of interest.

In summary, we have introduced a multicanonical ensemble for the numerical simulation of first order phase transitions, which eliminates an exponentially fast increase of the tunneling time between the ordered and disordered states in the critical region of the system. This finding is achieved by replacing the usual equilibrium dynamics of the canonical ensemble, through a new equilibrium dynamics, where the ordered and disordered states of the system get heated and cooled in a well controlled way. Thus configurations dominated by the presence of the interface are enhanced during the simulation.

The multicanonical MC algorithm gives a general framework for the numerical studies of first order phase transitions in statistical mechanics as well as for field theoretic models. From the numerical point of view the interesting question will be what improvement factors can be achieved as compared to standard algorithms for certain models on certain lattice sizes. We expect the answer to this question to be determined by the value of the quantity Q = FsL  ×  Ld - 1, where the strength of the first order phase transition is indicated by the magnitude of FsL and the d is the dimensionality of the system. In the case of the 2d 10-state potts model we find at values of Q  ~  10 approximately an improvement of two to three orders of magnitude, while at values of Q  ~  1 the improvement is marginal.

An implementation of the multicanonical MC algorithm for non-Abelian gauge theories is straightforward and we think that future investigations of the QCD deconfining phase transition will benefit from this. Beyond first order phase transition, it may well be that multicanonical algorithms could be of use for other numerical calculations in statistical mechanics, like estimates of the free energy or spin glass simulations.
