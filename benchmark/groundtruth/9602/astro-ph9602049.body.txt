Introduction

Ratnatunga et al. (1995; hereafter ROGI) have recently proposed that two objects found in archival Hubble Space Telescope images are new examples of "Einstein cross" gravitational lenses produced by distant elliptical galaxies. In each case four very faint blue compact images are symmetrically placed around a brighter red galaxy. One of these objects, HST 14176+5226, is in the "Groth-Westphal" GTO survey strip (Groth et al. 1994). By chance, this object has been previously observed during the Canada-France Redshift Survey (CFRS) as CFRS14.1311. This fact is not as improbable as it may seem, since the 1415+52 CFRS field and the "Groth-Westphal" survey strip were both (and independently) co-located with the ultradeep radio field of Fomalont et al. (1991) to allow identifications of these radio sources (see Hammer et al. 1995; CFRS VII).

As well as pointing out the previously-published redshift for the candidate lens (z = 0.81, Lilly et al. 1995b; CFRS III), we show in this Letter that our spectrum of CFRS14.1311 also displays a spatially extended emission line at 5342 Å that almost certainly originates from two of the four faint blue images. This line is likely to be Ly α at z = 3.4. A less prominent emission feature at 6822Å may be C IV at this redshift. Our data thus strongly support the identification of this system as a new quadruply-imaged gravitational lens. The secure redshift of the lens and the proposed redshift of the lensed object will allow more detailed modelling of this system.

Observations

Accurate astrometric positions for all objects in the CFRS 1415+52 field were determined to enable identification and investigation of the optical counterparts of the μJy radio sources catalogued by Fomalont et al. (1991). The resulting optical positions agree with those of their radio counterparts to within 0 (CFRS VII). The (2000) coordinates of CFRS14.1311 are 14h 17m 35 +52 26 46, which differs from the position given by ROGI by several arcseconds. However, it is clearly the same object and Ratnatunga (private communication) agrees that the published ROGI position is in error. No radio source is present at the location of CFRS14.1311 on the VLA map (with S5GHz >   8μJy) published by Fomalont et al. (1991).

Details of the CFRS photometric observations are given in Lilly et al. (1995a; CFRS I), and the spectroscopic observations are described in Le Fèvre et al. (1995; CFRS II). The full 1415+52 field catalogue, including CFRS14.1311, is presented in CFRS III.

The lensing galaxy

The candidate lens, CFRS14.1311, is an elliptical galaxy at z = 0.809. Our published redshift of this galaxy in CFRS III is z = 0.807, but the displacement of the galaxy in the slit (see below) suggests that the redshift was underestimated by 0.002. Koo et al. (1996) have also observed this galaxy and find a very similar redshift, z = 0.811.

The spectrum of CFRS14.1311 is shown in Figure 1. The strong "4000Å break", the Ca H and K lines, and the G band unmistakeably indicate the redshift for this galaxy. Our isophotal I magnitude, I  =  IAB  -  0.48  =  19.5 is comparable to the total F814W magnitude, 19.7, reported by ROGI. The (B - V)AB colour, measured in a 3arcsec aperture is 1.4 mag. With H0  =  50km s- 1Mpc- 1, the absolute magnitude of this galaxy is MAB(B)  =   - 22.9 with q0  =  0.5 and MAB(B)  =   - 23.4 with q0  =  0.0.

The lensed object

As illustrated in Figure 1, the spectrum of CFRS14.1311 also shows emission features at 5342Å and 6822Å. The line at 5342Å is clearly seen on all seven spectra taken of this object between 1993 Feb 23-25 and does not correspond to any known line at the redshift of the elliptical galaxy (λrest  ~  2956Å). The line at 6822Å is less compelling as it is located in a region of the elliptical galaxy spectrum (λrest  ~  3775Å) that has strong features produced by multiple stellar absorption lines below the 4000 Å break.

The identification of the 5342Å emission feature with a background source is strongly supported by the extent and orientation of the emission line on our 2-dimensional spectrogram shown in Figure 2. The left panel of Figure 2 shows the slit position for our spectroscopic observations superimposed on a montage of our ground-based image of CFRS14.1311 and the HST image (Figure 1 of ROGI shows a nice HST image of the lens: the orientation of their figure is such that North is diagonally up to the right, at [formula] to the vertical). Post facto examination of our spectroscopic data shows unambiguously that our 1 East-West slit was displaced 0 northwards from the center of the elliptical galaxy. This was undoubtedly due to the fact that this particular slit was located near the corner of the spectrograph slit mask where the astrometric distortion corrections used in cutting the mask were less certain. This displacement accounts for 0.002 of the redshift difference between our previously published value and that of Koo et al. (1996).

As shown in Figure 2, both of the two northern images of the lens would have been included in the slit. That the 5342 Å emission feature comes from these two images is indicated by the morphology of the line on our two-dimensional spectrogram shown in the right panel. The line is noticeably more extended than the elliptical galaxy and the extent, 2arcsec, agrees well with the projected separation of the two northern images. Even more compelling, there is precise agreement between the apparent velocity gradient across this emission line and the spatial orientation of the two images if it is assumed that the apparent velocity gradient arises purely from the relative displacement of the images across the slit, i.e., the west side is shifted to higher wavelengths, or North, by 0. Since both the spatial extent and orientation of the 5342Å emission line agree so precisely with that expected from the image geometry, we believe the association of this emission feature with the two northern images is secure.

The other emission feature is less convincing. It doesn't appear to be extended and its wavelength differs by 15Å from the expected position of C IV at the same redshift. However, it is much weaker and is undoubtedly affected by the underlying elliptical galaxy spectrum. We note that it is located almost precisely at an apparent emission feature (actually due to surrounding absorption lines) in elliptical galaxy spectra, but it is considerably stronger than usual.

The observed equivalent width of the 5342Å emission feature is 55Å. Assuming a F606W magnitude difference of roughly 4.1 magnitudes (ROGI) between the elliptical galaxy and each of the four quad images, this implies an observed equivalent width of roughly 1200Å in each of the background objects. This very high equivalent width immediately suggests that the line is at high redshift, and, in particular, that it is Ly α at z = 3.394, which would still imply a rest-frame equivalent width of ~  270Å. The proposed Ly α emission feature is not resolved at our resolution (projected slit = 35Å) and hence is "narrow", raising the possibility that it might be the result of a strong starburst rather than an AGN.

Some support for this redshift identification comes from the less secure line at 6822Å which is very close to the wavelength of C IV 1549 at this redshift, though it should be noted that this feature does not appear to show the morphological signatures that made the association of the 5342Å line with the background objects so compelling. If real, this would indicate that the background object is a quasar, although the implied rest-frame equivalent width, 115Å (but very uncertain) is uncomfortably high. Less than 1% of QSOs have such strong lines (e.g. Hartwick & Schade 1990, Crampton et al. 1990). However, the absolute magnitude of the (lensed) object is Mb = -  23 for H0 = 50 km s- 1 Mpc- 1, q0 = 0, precisely at the classical dividing line between quasars and Seyfert galaxies. Large Ly α equivalent widths are more common among less luminous quasars, an effect first noticed by Baldwin(1977). Since nearly all quasars are variable, it is also possible that the lensed images were brighter during our observations which were taken 13 months earlier than the HST observations (1994 Mar 11). Assuming an isothermal potential for the lens, simple models indicate that the magnification of the faintest image in a quadrupole system with the source nearly exactly aligned with the lens would be ~  2. This would reduce the absolute magnitude of the background source to about Mb = -  22 for H0 = 50 km s- 1 Mpc- 1, q0 = 0, or ~    -  21 for q0 = 0.5. Thus the nature of the background object remains more uncertain than the redshift, but the quality of our data does not warrant further speculation on this point.

To summarize, we believe that the association of the emission feature at 5342Å with the northern pair of the quad pattern of images is secure. Identification of this line with Ly α at z = 3.394 is then highly probable, based on the high equivalent width that is implied. If the C IV line is real, it would confirm the redshift and would further imply that the background object is likely to be a low luminosity quasar. If the C IV is not real, however, then the background object could be a less active AGN or a star-forming galaxy. In all cases, a redshift of z = 3.4 remains by far the most plausible redshift, although lower redshifts can not be categorically ruled out.

Conclusion

Our spectra thus indicate that the lensing elliptical galaxy CFRS 14.1311 has a redshift z = 0.809, and that the lensed object is a quasar or a strong emission-line galaxy at z = 3.4. At these redshifts a simple singular isothermal lens model using the parameters derived by ROGI implies a lens dispersion of σ  =  230 km s- 1 and a mass-to-light ratio M/L =   14h- 1 M[formula]/L[formula]. This indicates that CFRS14.1311 is probably a straightforward case of a simple, isolated lens.

Although Refsdal and Surdej(1994) list eight four-image lenses in their recent review, several of these have complex geometry of either the lensed images and/or the lensing object(s). CFRS14.1311 appears to be one of simpler cases involving an isolated normal elliptical galaxy acting as a lens for a background AGN, and thus could, in principle, provide cosmological constraints through further monitoring (e.g., Refsdal and Surdej 1994, Schneider 1995). We emphasize that confirmation of our source redshift should be undertaken.

ROGI point out that their discovery rate of candidate lenses, two per 50 WFPC2 fields, is consistent with the surface density of bright foreground elliptical galaxies and the surface density of I  <  26 objects in the survey fields. Thus we might expect that the lensed object should be broadly "typical" of the compact objects seen at I  ~  26 in deep HST images. If we assume that the lensed object discussed here is indeed typical, then a large fraction of all of the faint background objects (8000 per WFPC2 field) should have strong Ly α emission. However, neither the extensive searches that have been undertaken for Ly α from primeval galaxies (e.g., Pritchet 1994), nor a simple extrapolation of the observed quasar number counts (e.g., Schade et al. 1996) to I  =  26, only ~  3000 deg- 2, would support such a conclusion.

Finally, this example of gravitationally lensed objects also demonstrates that lensing effects must be taken into account when deep HST images of field galaxies are being used to derive conclusions about numbers of companions, merger rates, and evolution in the high redshift universe.
