ABSTRACT

The articles [\cite=U] [\cite=M] [\cite=S] have strongly claimed to have found a Yukawa coupling in the Skyrme model. Although this claim is what people want to hear, their results have been obtained in a way which is inconsistent with systems with collective coordinates. In [\cite=M] [\cite=S], the authors have failed to take into account all the constraints. In [\cite=U] [\cite=M] [\cite=S], the authors have failed to use asymptotic states which are physical.

It is very well known that the Skyrme model has six constraints: three of them arise because the Skyrme solution does not have the translational invariance of the model; the other three are due to the rupture of isospin invariance of the solution. These constraints may be written after linearization as [\cite=U]

[formula]

where p̂a is the conjugate of a. a and p̂a are the fluctuations of the fields Φa and its conjugate Pa respectively, which depend on the collective coordinates of the system (three translational, Xi(t), and three isospin coordinates, θa(t)). φaS is the ath component of the Skyrme solution.

States which are physical must be annihilated by the constraints [\cite=bk]:

[formula]

where n denotes any of the six constraints. This has been the point which is missing in [\cite=M] [\cite=S] [\cite=U] and which have lead them to conclusions which are wrong. Consider a state with quantum number k and isospin a which is expressed as [\cite=U1] [\cite=O]

[formula]

and consider the case in which k denotes momentum, and then ψk are plane waves solutions. For |a k >  to be a physical state it must satisfy condition ([\ref=con0]). The vacuum must be physical which means

[formula]

for all n. Then we find that

[formula]

where

[formula]

for rotational constraints and

[formula]

for translational constraints. The reason for the inequality follows from the fact that the Yna's, unlike the plane waves, are not solutions of the Klein-Gordon equations of motion. Thus no orthogonality relation between ψk and Yna can be established. This means that the states |k,a >  are not physical states and cannot be used to construct asymptotic states.

The natural question is which states will be orthogonal to the Yna. The answer is simple: the use of Dirac brackets, D, which are defined in terms of the Poisson brackets, P, the constraints and gauges, must be used to obtain the equations of motion from the Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian in systems with collective coordinates [\cite=T]. The solutions to these equations of motion, fr, will then satisfy the twelve conditions

[formula]

Thus, states

[formula]

will be physical since they will satisfy condition ([\ref=con0]). Because the Yna vanish at large distances from the soliton, the Dirac brackets tend to the Poisson brackets far away from the soliton, and thus the fr's will behave like plane waves for |x| >  > 0.

We must now construct the Born terms for the asymptotic states |r a > . The Born terms can be obtained from the term in the reduction formula [\cite=U]

[formula]

when the asymptotic states are taken to be plane waves. See [\cite=U] for notation. When the solutions are not plane waves, we must replace it by [\cite=BD]

[formula]

since the step needed to arrive to ([\ref=B1]) from ([\ref=B2]) requires the use of the Klein-Gordon equation of motion which is not the case at hand.

It is a simple exercise following [\cite=gjs] [\cite=U] to arrive from ([\ref=B2]) to

[formula]

in the limit that the meson mass is smaller than the soliton mass. Here ΔJ / MS is the change in mass due to isospin rotations between the state |N(p) >  and the intermediate baryonic state |B(p') > . It is reassuringly that if the asymptotic states were plane waves, this expression is equivalent to eq. 3.25 of [\cite=U] in the limit of large soliton mass. In order to arrive to ([\ref=B4]), the reader must avoid performing the integral over space in ([\ref=B2]) and make use of the fact that

[formula]

A close inspection of ([\ref=B4]) shows that the asymptotic states must satisfy the conditions

[formula]

in order not to vanish. But this is equivalent to saying that the asymptotic states do not satisfy the constraints ([\ref=cont]) and ([\ref=e12]) and therefore are unphysical states. Thus the leading order contribution to ([\ref=B4]) vanishes, and the next to leading order terms cannot be use to claim the existence of a Yukawa coupling.

We have therefore learned that there is no contribution to the Born terms to leading order when the asymptotic states satisfy the constraints of the system. Thus means that there is no Yukawa coupling for the Skyrmion as claimed by other authors who have incorrectly used asymptotic states which do not satisfy the constraint.

A possible objection is that it is not possible to replace the fluctuations by their classical fields in the reduction formula. However, as shown in [\cite=O], the Born terms, can also be obtained by considering the process

[formula]

where H(2) = H(2)o + V(2), H(2) is the total quadratic Hamiltonian, H(2)o is the Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian, and V(2) is the remaining quadratic interactions. Also, ωr are the eigefrequencies of the states |r a >  which diagonalize H(2)oand ωm are the eigenfrequencies of the states |m a >  which diagonalize H(2). Both type of states |r a >  and |m a >  diagonalize their respective Hamiltonians by using the Dirac brackets and not the Poisson brackets. A simple manipulation of ([\ref=t1]) along the lines of [\cite=O] yields

[formula]

where the [formula] is over positive energy states only. The Born terms, is the first term in ([\ref=t2]). Again we see that because the states fr are physical, the first term in ([\ref=t2]) vanishes which means that there are no Born terms.

This absence of Yukawa coupling for a classical Skyrmion should not be taken as a drawback. Rather, we should try to extend the work of [\cite=YO2] to show that the Wilsonian action obtained for a quantum Skyrmion after integrating out the very energetic mesons has a Yukawa coupling.
