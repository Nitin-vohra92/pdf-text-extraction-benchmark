What future does the universe have?

Let us try to understand the future of the universe in the light of recent observations. Consider this beautiful equation:

[formula]

It describes the evolution of a homogeneous and isotropic universe according to General Relativity if the density of non-relativistic matter dominates radiation (and other sources of pressure). The first three terms can be obtained from Newtonian physics and are proportional to the kinetic energy, potential energy and total energy respectively. The last term is due to the cosmological constant Λ of General Relativity. The expansion parameter a(t) is normalized to a(t0)  =  1 today. The Hubble constant is

[formula]

with [formula][\cite=pdg]. Note that ([\ref=a]) at the present time is

[formula]

so the evolution of the universe on large scales is determined by just two independent parameters, e.g. Ωm and ΩΛ. Ωm is the present density of non-relativistic matter (barionic and dark) in units of the critical density [formula].

[formula]

where k  =   + 1, - 1 or 0. If k  =   + 1, space has the geometry of the 3-dimensional surface of a sphere of radius a0  ×  a(t) in 4 dimensions. If k  =   - 1, space has negative curvature. If k  =  0 then space is flat. Finally

[formula]

We consider the four universes listed in Table [\ref=comparison]: (Ωm,ΩΛ)  =  (1,0) is the Einstein-de Sitter critical universe with flat space that expands for ever with a velocity approaching zero; (1.5,0) is overdense and has a space of finite volume that expands to a maximum and then collapses into a Big Crunch; (0.3,0) is underdense so matter can not halt the expansion; and (0.3,0.7) has flat space and in the future will expand exponentially for ever due to the cosmological constant.

The purpose of this note is to estimate the likelihood that each of these universes corresponds to ours, and to understand in a simple way the issues involved. To obtain this estimate we compare observations with predictions using the " function:

[formula]

This function is written for the case when the observations are independent so that a judicious choice of observations is needed. In the end we shall see that the main source of uncertainty of this analysis is the estimate of the systematic errors. The contributions to the χ2 are listed in Table [\ref=comparison].

Let us begin with observations on galaxies. We have developed a simple model of the hierarchical formation of galaxies[\cite=Hoeneisen]. The simulations were done with h0  =  0.6. After adjusting three parameters (the amplitude A and slope n of the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations, and Ωm) this model is in quantitative agreement with the following observations: the Tully-Fisher, Faber-Jackson and Samurai relations, the Schechter distribution (two parameters), the galaxy-galaxy correlation (two parameters), the fluctuation in galaxy counts, the fluctuation in the cosmic background radiation, and the peculiar velocities of galaxies. To compare the model with observations we have obtained a χ2 with 7 terms. For each Ωm we have minimized the χ2 by varying 2 parameters: A and n[\cite=Hoeneisen]. Therefore for each Ωm we are left with 5 degrees of freedom. The corresponding χ2's for the four universes are 3.2, 3.7, 7.6 and 9.2, and the spectral indices n are 1.0, 0.9, 1.2 and 1.2, respectively. We note that observations on galaxies favor a universe with Ωm  ≈  1, ΩΛ  ≈  0 (the Einstein-de Sitter universe) and n  ≈  1 (scale invariant spectrum)[\cite=Hoeneisen] which is quite remarkable! In fact, for ΩΛ  =  0, we obtain agreement with observations provided Ωm  >  0.25 and 1.1  -  0.3Ωm  <  n  <  1.4  -  0.2Ωm with 95% confidence (assuming the model is correct and the simulation volume [formula] is sufficiently large)[\cite=Hoeneisen]. So all four universes considered in Table [\ref=comparison] are compatible with these observations on galaxies. However, if we restrict the slope n to 1 as suggested by the Boomerang and Maxima observations discussed below, then the χ2's for 6 degrees of freedom are as shown in Table [\ref=comparison] column G. Note that the two low density universes are disfavored by observations on galaxies if we set n  =  1: the velocities of circular orbits of L* galaxies are too low, the fluctuations in galaxy counts are too low (unless n is tilted to 1.25), and the peculiar velocities of galaxies are too low (unless n is tilted to 1.3)[\cite=Hoeneisen].

Let us turn to the Boomerang and Maxima balloon-borne experiments. By observing the first acoustic peak of the fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation, the Boomerang collaboration obtains Ωm  +  ΩΛ with 95% confidence in the range from (0.88  -  1.12) to (0.97  -  1.35) depending on the assumed priors and parametrizations[\cite=Boomerang]. We translate this into Ωm  +  ΩΛ  =  1.08  ±  0.16 (all errors in this article are one standard deviation or 68% confidence level unless otherwise stated). The Boomerang collaboration also mentions that " Ωm  +  ΩΛ  =  1.07  ±  0.06. These errors are statistical. We would like to add systematic errors, but these are hard to come by in cosmology. A full analysis is given in [\cite=Lange]. The Maxima experiment obtains Ωm  +  ΩΛ  =  1.00.15- 0.30 at 95% confidence[\cite=Maxima]. To be somewhat conservative we finally take Ωm  +  ΩΛ  =  1.0  ±  0.1  ±  0.1 where the first error is statistical and the last term is a rather arbitrary estimate of the systematic errors. The corresponding contributions to χ2 are listed in Table [\ref=comparison] column B. Note that the remarkable Boomerang and Maxima observations already rule out the two non-flat universes listed in Table [\ref=comparison]. Let us mention that the Boomerang experiment obtains a slope of the power spectrum of primordial density perturbations n  =  1.0  ±  0.1[\cite=Lange] which is consistent with scale invariance. Maxima obtains n  =  1.08  ±  0.1[\cite=Maxima].

Let us consider the age of the universe as inferred from the evolution of globular clusters. The estimates[\cite=pdg] range from 18Gyr to 11Gyr with additional ±  10% errors of various origins. Thus current estimates are 14  ±  2Gyr, "[\cite=pdg]. A recent study obtains 11.5  ±  1.3Gyr[\cite=Chaboyer]. We take 14  ±  2  ±  2 where the first error is statistical and the second is a rather arbitrary estimate of the systematic error. In Table [\ref=comparison] we show the calculated ages (for the central value of H0) and their contributions to the χ2.

Now we consider measurements of the density of the universe. A compilation of methods and results can be found in [\cite=pdg]. The " methods yield Ωm in the range 0.1 to 0.4. These measurement do not include extended dark matter halos between galaxy clusters. In our model of galaxy formation[\cite=Hoeneisen] [\cite=Hoeneisen-2] the galaxies and clusters of galaxies have halos with density run [formula] that extend, a grosso modo, out to the halo of the " galaxy or cluster of galaxies (once the peculiar motion is removed). This is possible at all times, in spite of the expansion of the universe, because of the ongoing hierarchical formation and merging of galaxies. For example, if clusters of galaxies have radius R, and the halos of dark matter with density run [formula] extend out to r  ≈  3R, then Ωm measured by the " method is low by a factor ≈  3. Such extended halos are expected[\cite=Hoeneisen] [\cite=Hoeneisen-2]. Is there any evidence to rule them out? For these reasons I believe that the quoted measurements of Ωm are really lower bounds. The " method obtains Ωm in the range from 0.15 to 0.35 but also does not include the halos of dark matter between clusters. The " methods yield results in the range 0.1 to 1[\cite=pdg]. In particular the study by Idit Zehavi and A. Dekel[\cite=Zehavi] obtains 0.4  <  Ωm  <  1.1 for ΩΛ  =  0 or 0.2  <  Ωm  <  0.9 for ΩΛ  =  0.7 at 99% confidence. The lower bound assumes h0  =  0.75 and n  =  1.1, while the upper bound assumes h0  =  0.55 and n  =  0.9. From the evolution of the number density of x-ray clusters it is inferred that Ωm  ≈  0.74 while Ωm  <  0.3 is rejected with 95% confidence[\cite=Blanchard]. For these reasons, and because the χ2 corresponding to galaxies already includes peculiar velocities, galaxy clustering, and velocities of circular orbits which are used to measure Ωm, we take a conservative Ωm  =  0.3+ 0.3- 0.2. The corresponding contributions to the χ2 are presented in Table [\ref=comparison].

Last, but not least, we consider the Hubble diagram of relative luminosity (magnitude) vs red-shift of supernovae of type 1a. This is a very interesting measurement. The results obtained by the "[\cite=Perlmutter_1] [\cite=Perlmutter] [\cite=Goobar] [\cite=Perlmutter_2] have been confirmed by the "[\cite=Leibundgut] [\cite=Garnavich] [\cite=Schmidt]. At high redshift the supernovae are fainter than expected (from the extrapolation of low redshift supernovae) yielding [formula][\cite=Perlmutter_1] [\cite=Perlmutter_2] in the range of interest. The corresponding contributions to the χ2 are listed in Table [\ref=comparison] column S. For a flat universe this measurement translates to [formula][\cite=Perlmutter_1] [\cite=Perlmutter_2]. The systematic error is dominated by evolution. The errors labeled " above correspond to an error in magnitude of ±  0.2 for high redshift supernovae. The preliminary estimate of this error in [\cite=Perlmutter_2] is ±  0.2 mag. The corresponding estimate in [\cite=Schmidt] is ±  0.17 mag. In comparison note that the correction for extinction is of order 1 mag with and error ≈    ±  0.15 mag. The challenge is to reduce the error due to evolution, and the jury is still out. Are the high-redshift supernovae 10% fainter than expected because of " dust, or evolution of supernovae, or evolution of the host galaxy, or gravitational lensing, or selection effects, or increased extinction in the host galaxy at high redshift, or is it really due to a cosmological constant? Or more mundane challenges that seem to be under control (but who knows?): how does the luminosity calibration or zero change with redshift?; how does noise subtraction or the subtraction of the luminosity of the host galaxy depend on luminosity or redshift? Radio and optical gravitational lensing observations set the limit - 1.78  <  ΩΛ  -  Ωm  <  0.27 at 95% confidence[\cite=Helbig]. This limit corresponds to - 0.39  <  ΩΛ  <  0.64 assuming a flat universe[\cite=Helbig] which is already cutting well into the allowed region of the supernovae observations. Note that the size of the estimated systematic error due to supernovae evolution can completely change the conclusions of this study! If the error is half the estimate given above, then the Einstein-de Sitter universe is ruled out.

The probabilities that observations are consistent with the model universes is shown in column CL of Table [\ref=comparison]. These probabilities are proportional to the likelihood that the models are correct given the observations (if in advance we have no good reason to prefer one model over the other). We note that the two non-flat universes are excluded by several observations. The preferred universe has (Ωm,ΩΛ)  =  (0.3,0.7). Note that only one of the observations (almost) rules out the Einstein-de Sitter universe, and in cosmology it is best to keep an open mind.

To understand the accelerating universe (Ωm,ΩΛ)  =  (0.3,0.7) let us compare it with the Einstein-de Sitter universe (1,0). This latter universe has a present age t0  =  2 / 3H0  =  9.2Gyr; the expansion factor is [formula]; the present distance to the horizon is dH(t0)  =  2c / H0  =  3ct0; and the co-moving distance to the horizon dH(t) / a(t) will continue increasing as [formula] so that new galaxies will always be entering the horizon. The universe with a cosmological constant, (0.3,0.7), has a present age t0  =  0.97 / H0  =  13.3Gyr; the expansion factor will grow exponentially in the future as [formula]; the present distance to the horizon is dH(t0)  =  3.4c / H0  =  3.3ct0; and the co-moving distance to the horizon dH(t) / a(t) will approach 4.5c / H0 so that after a few 1 / H0 no new galaxies will enter the horizon. In addition, the galaxies that are within the horizon will become exponentially redshifted and dimmer: their relative luminosity will decrease as [formula] so that after a few 1 / H0 only the galaxies of the local group, which are gravitationally bound, will remain visible.

Finally let us calculate the time it will take to exhaust the fuel of the universe, i.e. mainly hydrogen (and also the elements from helium to manganese). We assume that hydrogen is burned at the rate we see today. The luminosity density of the universe is LB  =  (2.0  ±  0.4)  ×  108h0LsunMpc- 3[\cite=pdg] with Lsun  ≈  3.85  ×  1026W. The energy released per proton is ≈  8.8MeV. The density of hydrogen in the universe is ρH  =  0.76ρB  ≈  0.76  ×  0.019ρc0  /  h20. From this data we obtain a time to exhaustion of hydrogen at the present rate of consumption of ≈  4000Gyr, or about 300 times the present age of the universe.

In summary, we have considered four universes. From Table [\ref=comparison] we note that one of them is preferred by observations: the low density universe with a cosmological constant. The conclusion is tentative pending a full study of possible evolutionary effects of supernovae and a positive detection of the cosmological constant by an independent method. The Einstein-de Sitter universe can not be ruled out yet. If the cosmological constant is not zero the question is: why are terms with Ωm and ΩΛ in Equation [\ref=a] of comparable magnitude today, when one dominated by many orders of magnitude in the past, and the other will dominate in the future? This is the " problem. Another question: why is the cosmological constant so small compared to predictions, yet (apparently) not zero?

Let us assume that the universe is indeed (Ωm,ΩΛ)  =  (0.3,0.7). In this case we live in a universe that is spatially flat and so has infinite volume; distances between far away galaxies will expand exponentially for ever; galaxies will cease to enter the horizon; the ones within the horizon will dim exponentially fast until only the local group remains visible; the galaxies of the local group, which are gravitationally bound, will merge into a single one; small perturbations [formula] of the density of the universe will cease to grow and the hierarchical formation of galaxies will come to a halt; hydrogen fuel will become exhausted, stars will die leaving cinders (white dwarfs which will cool and stop shining, neutron stars and black holes), and darkness and cold will prevail for ever. No conscience will be there to know.
