Introduction

The Einstein-Hilbert action includes only scalar curvature

[formula]

Here Smatter is the action of matter fields. On the other hand the action of R2-gravity includes the square of the curvatures

[formula]

One of the reasons why we consider the R2-gravity is because the limit of α'  →  0 limit in string theory corresponds the Einstein gravity but if we include the first order correction with respect to α', we obtain R2-gravity. From the viewpoint of the AdS/CFT correspondence [\cite=AdS] (or recent dS/CFT correspondence[\cite=strominger] [\cite=ds1] [\cite=noplb]), α' correction corresponds to 1 / N corrections in the field theory side. The equations of motion of the R2-gravity, which correspond to the Einstein equation has the following form:

[formula]

Here Tμν is energy-momentum tensor of matter: [formula]. The above equation ([\ref=III]) is very complicated but there are several solvable cases. One is c = 0 case, where the Riemann tensor Rνρμσ does not appear in the equation of motion, then the solutions can be constructed from the solutions of the Einstein equation. The other is the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant combination (a = c, b =  - 4c) case. Of course, the GB term is trivial (topological) in 4 dimensions but non-trivial when the dimensions of the spacetime are more than 4.

We find the black hole (BH) solutions for the c = 0 case in Section [\ref=Sec2] and for the Gauss-Bonnet combination case in Section [\ref=Sec3]. By using the obtained solution, we investigate the thermodynamics of the R2-gravity in Section [\ref=Sec4] and we find the Hawking-Page like phase transition, which is the phase transition between the black hole spacetime and the pure AdS spacetime. From the viewpoint of the AdS/CFT correspondence, such a phase transition may be that of the field theory when we include 1 / N corrections. An interesting feature of higher derivative gravity is the possibility of the negative (or zero) dS (or AdS) BH entropy which depends on the parameters of higher derivative terms. In Section [\ref=Sec5], we investigate the problem of the negative entropy and we speculate that the appearence of negative entropy may indicate a new type instability where a transition between dS (AdS) BH with negative entropy and AdS (dS) BH with positive entropy occurs. In Section [\ref=Sec5], we apply the GB gravity to the brane cosmology, where the brane moves in the bulk AdS black hole spacetime. By investigating the FRW-like equation, which describes the motion of the brane, we find the behavior of the matter fields on the brane. When the radius of the brane is large, the matter fields behave as CFT but when the radius is small, the brane universe behaves as the universe with dust or curvature dominant universe, depending on the parameters. The last section is devoted to the summary.

This report is mainly based on [\cite=NOO1] [\cite=NOO2] [\cite=CNO] [\cite=NO1] [\cite=NO2] [\cite=LNO] [\cite=NOO3].

Solutions of c = 0 case

We first consider the solutions of c = 0 case. The D = d + 1 dimensional Einstein equation without matter is, of course, given by

[formula]

Then by multiplying gμν, we find the scalar curvature is constant [formula] and the Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric [formula] and therefore covariantly constant [formula] due to the condition of the metricity [formula]. We now apply this results to the R2-gravity with c = 0.

By assuming

[formula]

and substituting these expressions of the curvatures to Eq.([\ref=III]) with c = 0, we obtain

[formula]

from which l2 can be determined. Then if we choose [formula] in the Einstein equation ([\ref=VI]), we can construct a solution of R2-gravity (with c = 0) from the solution of the vacuum Einstein equation.

Solutions in the Gauss-Bonnet combination case

In this section, we consider the solutions in the Gauss-Bonnet combination.

By using Bianchi identity

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

By using the above equations ([\ref=X]), we can rewrite the equations of motion ([\ref=III]) as follows:

[formula]

When the coefficients a, b, c are Gauss-Bonnet combination: a = c and b =  - 4c, one finds

[formula]

Since the above equation does not contain the derivative of the curvarutre, the equation contains only second order derivative of the metric tensor. As a classical theory, if we impose the initial conditions for metric tesor and its first derivative with respect to time, the metric tensor can be determined uniquely.

We now find a solution. We now assume the metric in the following form:

[formula]

Here ij : the metric tensor of the Einstein manifold defined by ij = kgij. Here ij is the Ricci tensor given by ij and k is a constant. For example, k = d - 2 corresponds to the d - 1-dimensional unit sphere, k =  - (d - 2) to d - 1-dimensional unit hyperboloid and k = 0 to a flat surface.

We consider the electromagnetic fields as a matter:

[formula]

Here Aμ is a vector potential (gauge field) and g is the gauge coupling. If Ftr =  - Frt only depend on r and the other components of Fμν vanish, one finds

[formula]

Here Q is a constant corresponding to the electric charge. Then the solution, which was first found in [\cite=Wil], appears

[formula]

The radius r = rH of the event horizon, where e2ν = 0 or e- 2λ = 0, is given by

[formula]

The Haking temperature TH is also given by

[formula]

Especially for d = 4, we have

[formula]

When r is large, the obtained solution behaves as

[formula]

We compare the above behavior with the Reissner-Nordstrø m-AdS solution in the Einstein gravity:

[formula]

and we find

[formula]

that is

[formula]

Hawking-Page phase transition in R2-gravity

Since the black hole has temperature, one can consider the thermodynamics of the spacetime. The theory with finite temperature for an action S(φ) is given by Wick-rotating the time coordinate (t  →  it) and imposing the periodic boundary condition for t with the period β: [formula]. The period β can be regarded as the inverse of the temperature T: [formula]. Here kB is the Boltzmann constant and we put kB = 1 in the following. Then Z(β) can be regarded as the thermodynamical partition function. In the WKB approximation, by substituting the classical solution φ  =  φclass into the action, we obtain the free energy F by [formula]. In the following, we concentrate on the D = d + 1 = 5 dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetime.

Before going to the R2-gravity, we consider the case of Einstein gravity without matter. When the spacetime metric is given by

[formula]

we find

[formula]

Then SEinstein diverges. The regularization of the divergence is given by cutting off the integral at a large radius r = r max and subtracting the solution of pure but finite temperature AdS:

[formula]

The factor eν(r = r max) - ν(r = r max;μ  =  0) is chosen so that the proper length of the circle which corresponds to the period [formula] in the Euclidean time at r = r max coincides with each other in the two solutions. Especially for k = 2, we find in the limit of r max  →    ∞

[formula]

When [formula], the free energy becomes negative: F < 0, which tells that black hole spacetime is more stable than the pure AdS spacetime. That is, large black holes are stable but small ones are instable and there is a critical point at [formula], which is the famous Hawking-Page phase transition [\cite=HP].

In c = 0 R2-gravity case, we find

[formula]

which is similar to that in the Einstein gravity case ([\ref=XXVIII]) but there is a critical point (surface) at

[formula]

Therefore when [formula], small black hole is stable.

In case of the Gauss-Bonnet-Maxwell black hole case, we find

[formula]

Since we have two independent parameters μ and Q2, rH can be independent of TH. Then the critical line, where F = 0, is given by

[formula]

If TH > Tc and r2H > 12cκ (or, TH < Tc and r2H < 12cκ), pure anti-de Sitter spacetime is more stable than the black hole spacetime. On the other hand, if TH < Tc and r2H > 12cκ (or, TH > Tc and r2H < 12cκ), vice versa. In order to simplify the expressions, we (re)define the following parameters and the variables:

[formula]

Then the critical temperature Tc is expressed as

[formula]

>From the above expression ([\ref=XXXIV]), one gets:

When ε < 0 [formula], Tc is always positive. Then if TH > Tc [formula], the pure AdS (black hole) spacetime is more stable than black hole (pure AdS) spacetime.

When [formula], the critical temperature Tc is positive when r2H > 12ε and there is a critical line, where if TH > Tc [formula], the pure AdS (black hole) spacetime is more stable than the black hole (pure AdS) spacetime. When r2H < 12ε, Tc is negative, then the black hole spacetime is always stable.

When [formula], if r2H > 12ε, Tc is negative and the pure AdS spacetime is more stable than the black hole spacetime. If r2H < 12ε, Tc is positive and if TH > Tc [formula], the black hole (pure AdS) spacetime is more stable than the pure AdS (black hole) spacetime.

The conceptual (not-exact) Hawking-Page phase diagrams are given by Figures [\ref=Fig1a], [\ref=Fig1b] and [\ref=Fig1c].

Negative Entropy?

In this section, based on the entropy, we investigate the relation between Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole and Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter black hole.

In the spacetime with black hole, we put a boundary, which is a surface with constant r. On the boundary, one takes an action, which makes the variational principle well-defined (like Gibbons-Hawking term) and further makes the total action finite. Then we can define an energy-momentum tensor on the boundary and we can determine the mass M (d = 4):

[formula]

M is thermodynamical energy E [\cite=BK].

By using the thermodynamical relation [formula], in c = 0 case, one arrives at

[formula]

Here S0 is a constant of the integration. Then there might appear a natural question, that is, when

[formula]

is entropy negative? Even if S0  ≠  0, the entropy becomes negative for the large (large rH) black hole. We should note that l2 (d = 4) is given by solving Eq.([\ref=VIII]) with d = 4, which can be rewritten as

[formula]

Then if

[formula]

there are real solution of l2:

[formula]

Then from Figure [\ref=Fig2], we find

When 80a + 16b > 0 and Λ > 0, or 80a + 16b < 0 and Λ < 0, one of the solutions of l2 is positive but another is negative. Then there are two kind of solution, one is asymptotically anti-de Sitter and another is asymptotically de Sitter.

When 80a + 16b > 0 and Λ < 0, l2 is always positive. Both of two solutions express the asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime.

When 80a + 16b < 0 and Λ > 0, l2 < 0. Both of two solutions correspond to asymptotically de Sitter spacetime.

=0.3mm

The expression of the entropy ([\ref=XXXVI]) can be applied even for asymptotically de Sitter spacetime by putting l2 =  - l2dS < 0. By the explicit expression of l2 via Λ, a, b, and κ2, we obtain

[formula]

If we assume the entropy should be positive, we need to choose the lower sign +   in ±   since the entropy always becomes negative if we choose the upper sign -  . Even if one chooses the lower sign +  , the entropy is not always positive but it becomes positive when

[formula]

Then we obtain the diagram in Figure [\ref=Fig3].

=0.28mm

In the Gauss-Bonnet case, we obtain

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

Here [formula] and the length parameter l2 is given by

[formula]

Then in order that l2 is a real number, we have

[formula]

Then we find

When cΛ > 0, there exist two kind of solutions, one expresses asymptotically AdS spacetime and another expresses the asymptotically dS spacetime.

When c > 0 and Λ < 0, both of two solutions expresses asymptotically AdS spacetime.

When c < 0 and Λ > 0, both of solutions correspond to asymptotically dS spacetime.

Substituting the expression of l2, we obtain

[formula]

Therefore when

[formula]

the entropy is always positive for both of solutions corresponding to the ±   sign. Especially when cΛ > 0, both of solutions expressing asymptotically AdS and dS spacetime. Then we cannot exclude one of the solution from the viewpoint of the entropy.

Application to the brane cosmology

We now consider application of the Gauss-Bonnet gravity to the brane cosmology. Here we consider Q = 0 case for the simplicity. In the bulk black hole spacetime in the Gauss-Bonnet gravity, the motion of the brane can be described by the Friedmann-like equation. One may employ the method developed in Ref.[\cite=NOO1] [\cite=NOO2] [\cite=LNO] to derive the Friedmann equation. Then we obtain

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here we have defined the rescaled parameters: [formula] and [formula]. The standard FRW equations for 4-dimensions can be written as

[formula]

Here, [formula] is the derivative with respect to cosmological time. Then ρ and p are

[formula]

where ' denotes the derivative with respect to a. Similarly, FRW equations from the bulk dS BH can be constructed (see [\cite=LNO]).

In case of a  →    ∞  , we obtain

[formula]

When we choose the upper sign of ±   and ∓  , the expressions in ([\ref=FRW2]) and ([\ref=r3]) are simplified as

[formula]

Then the energy-momentum tensor is traceless (Tμ μ  =  ρ - 3p = 0.) and there should be CFT on the brane. On the other hand, if we choose the lower signs, we find the FRW equations with the cosmological term:

[formula]

We can divide ρ and p into the sums of the contributions from the matter and those from the cosmological term:

[formula]

Then we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand, the energy-momentum tensor Tm μν of the matter is again traceless,

[formula]

Then the matter field should be CFT again.

We now consider the limit of a  →  0 when [formula].

[formula]

Then the energy-momentum tensor is not traceless. Since ρ, p ~  a- 2, this limit corresponds to the curvature dominant case. We now rewrite the FRW equation in the following form:

[formula]

Here [formula] and [formula] can be regarded as the effective energy density and effective k:

[formula]

When k is large, [formula] behaves as a- 2.

When [formula], X in ([\ref=XY]), H in ([\ref=H1]) and G in ([\ref=G1]) become complex at a = 0, which may tell that there is a minimum of a given by Y = 0:

[formula]

When a = a min, we have

[formula]

Then by dividing them into the contributions from the cosmological term and the matter, we find

[formula]

As a special case, we can consider the case of ε = 1 / 4. Since

[formula]

and f(a) = H2  ≥  0, we find k  ≤  0. In this case, the energy density and the pressure vanish: rho = 0, p = 0. If one put ε = 1 / 4 - δ2 and δ is small, the energy density and the pressure are given by

[formula]

Then in the limit of a  →  0, we have |ρ|  ≫  |p| and ρ  ~  a- 3, which corresponds to "dust". On the other hand, when a  →    ∞  , we find (if k  ≥  0) ρ, p  ~  a- 2, which tells curvature dominant. When k =  - 2 < 0, a has a minimum a = l.

More applications to the cosmology are given in [\cite=LNO] [\cite=NOO3]. Especially the solution describing the bounce universe has been found.

Summary

We have obtained exact solutions in R2-gravity when the action does not contain the term of the square of the Riemann tensor (c = 0) and when the R2-terms are the Gauss-Bonnet combination with the electromagnetic fields. We have also investigated the thermodynamics of the R2-gravity and we have found that the entropy often becomes negative. The application to the brane cosmology is interesting and given in [\cite=LNO] [\cite=NOO3].
