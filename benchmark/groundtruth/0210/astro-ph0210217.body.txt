Probing dark energy with SNAP

Dark Energy Today

The discovery in 1998 [\cite=perl] [\cite=hiz] that the expansion of the universe is accelerating energized both the cosmology and particle physics communities. Whatever the physical mechanism - a cosmological constant, dynamical scalar field, higher dimensions, or altered gravitation - it lies beyond the current standard model of physics. Moreover, such an acceleration requires an unknown component to contribute the majority of the energy density of the universe - twice as much as the matter density. Researchers are intently designing theories to explain these observations as well as experiments to test the theories and probe the nature of this "dark energy".

Type Ia supernovae observations have a clear, simple connection to the expansion of the universe that makes them excellent at probing the dynamics out to redshifts [formula]. The apparent magnitude, or intensity, of the supernova is a measure of the distance and its redshift directly translates into the expansion factor, mapping out the recent expansion history of the universe.

Other cosmological probes exist as well, and early data from them have confirmed the original supernova results. From the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the locations of the acoustic peaks in the temperature power spectrum coincidentally lie along contours of the age of the universe [\cite=knox], with their measurement implying a total age [formula] billion years. Such a high number requires a substantial negative equation of state component in addition to matter, at least for conventional values of the Hubble constant. Note though that this argument does rely on the universe being flat and the matter density perturbations adiabatic. The detailed structure of the CMB power spectrum gives further information: currently it is best fit with a cosmological constant contribution to the dimensionless energy density of ΩΛ = 0.53 - 0.70 [\cite=bond]. This as well depends on subsidiary knowledge, e.g. neglecting the gravitational wave contribution to the power.

From large scale galaxy redshift surveys such as 2dF, the power spectrum of matter density fluctuations also points to an accelerating universe through its shape [\cite=teghamxu]. The "look" of large scale structure in computer simulations agrees as well with the presence of a large cosmological constant like component. In the next few years measurements of the growth rate of evolving structure may become precise enough to give further evidence. Combining CMB and large scale structure provides strong evidence for a universe consisting 1/3 of matter and 2/3 of some dark energy [\cite=bond] [\cite=efst]; this is independent of and fully consistent with the supernova measurements. So today we have a concordance that the universe is accelerating, its energy dominated by dark energy with a strongly negative equation of state.

The Next Generation

But we know almost nothing of the nature of the dark energy - its equation of state ratio of pressure to density, w = p / ρ, or whether this evolves, e.g. w'. These two quantities hold crucial clues to the underlying fundamental physics. By mapping the expansion history of the universe we can investigate the properties of the new physics. Illustratively, distance-redshift observations d(z) teach us the cosmological dynamics, which in turn guides us to the high energy field theory:

[formula]

where V(φ) is the potential of the dark energy field.

A next generation experiment needs to be carefully designed to probe the dark energy. But systematic uncertainties rather than merely paucity or imprecision of observations will be the key obstacle. The CMB is insensitive to time variation and can only provide a rough estimate of an averaged value of w, except for a small impact on the late time Sachs-Wolfe effect buried in cosmic variance. Gravitaional lensing and the growth rate of large scale structure is promising, but needs to be separated from complicated nonlinear astrophysics. Supernovae studies directly measure the expansion dynamics and have a longer history than the various structure related methods. From this history a comprehensive list of possible systematics, and methods for accounting for them, have been developed and a new experiment is under design dedicated to exploring dark energy: the Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) satellite [\cite=snap].

To investigate the dark energy and distinguish between classes of physics models we need to probe the expansion back into the matter dominated deceleration epoch, indeed over a redshift baseline reaching z > 1.5 [\cite=lh02]. The SNAP mission concept is a 2.0 meter space telescope with a nearly one square degree field of view. A half billion pixel, wide field imaging system comprises 36 large format new technology CCD's and 36 HgCdTe infrared detectors. Both the imager and a low resolution (R  ~  100) spectrograph cover the wavelength range 3500 - 17000 Å, allowing detailed characterization of Type Ia supernovae out to z = 1.7.

As a space experiment SNAP will be able to study supernovae over a much larger range of redshifts than has been possible with the current ground-based measurements - over a wide wavelength range unhindered by the Earth's atmosphere and with much higher precision and accuracy.

An array of data (e.g. supernova risetime, early detection to eliminate Malmquist bias, lightcurve peak-to-tail ratio, spectrum, separation of supernova light from host galaxy light, identification of host galaxy morphology, etc.) makes it possible to study each individual supernova and measure enough of its physical properties to recognize deviations from standard brightness subtypes. For example, an approach to the problem of possible supernova evolution [\cite=coping] uses the rich stream of information that an expanding supernova atmosphere sends us in the form of its spectrum. A series of measurements will be constructed for each supernova that define systematics-bounding subsets of the Type Ia category. Only the change in brightness as a function of the parameters classifying a subtype is needed, not any intrinsic brightness. By matching like to like among the supernova subtypes over redshift, we can construct independent distance-redshift, or Hubble, diagrams for each, which when compared bound systematic uncertainties at the targeted level of 0.02 magnitudes.

Revealing the Nature of Dark Energy

Generically the equation of state of dark energy is not constant in time and indeed its evolution provides critical information on the class of physics responsible for the accelerating expansion. Only SNAP, with its systematics bounded measurements and broad redshift reach, looks promising for uncovering this clue. Until recently this variation was parametrized through a linear expansion in redshift

[formula]

and SNAP measurements together with a prior on Ωm of 0.03 could determine w1 to [formula].

However as we probe the expansion history to redshifts z > 1 we would like a more accurate representation of the field evolution than Eq. [\ref=wz]. Indeed if we wish to combine complementary cosmological probes, such as CMB data with supernovae, then clearly such a simple parametrization is insufficient. Linder [\cite=li02] has developed a new parametrization in terms of expansion factor a that removes these difficulties and greatly improves the accuracy of reconstruction of the field behavior and the cosmological parameter estimation,

[formula]

while retaining simplicity and a two parameter phase space.

Figure [\ref=wareal] illustrates the success in modeling various dark energy models. While the w1 parametrization blows up for high redshifts, and indeed by z = 1.7 is already off by 27% for the supergravity inspired SUGRA model, the new parametrization stays well behaved and is within 3% of the true SUGRA equation of state. More important observationally is the distance-redshift relation, and this parametrization recreates it for SUGRA to within 0.2% out to the CMB last scattering surface at z = 1100 .

The well behaved nature of this parametrization allows CMB data to be conjoined naturally with the supernovae measurements. This has great advantages due to their complementarity [\cite=fhlt]. For example, SUGRA predicts wa = 0.58 and one might consider [formula] a natural measure of time variation. It is directly related to the scalar field potential slow roll factor V' / V, and z  ~  1 is the region where the scalar field is most likely to be evolving as the epoch of matter domination begins to change over to dark energy domination. SNAP plus data from the Planck CMB mission could estimate this important quantity to [formula], i.e. this could demonstrate time variation of the dark energy equation of state at the ~  99% confidence level (cf. Figure [\ref=lamsug]).

Summary

Dark energy is a crucial puzzle for fundamental physics, cosmology, and gravitation. But upcoming experiments, especially the proposed SNAP satellite, can probe its nature by constructing datasets both precise and bounded in systematic effects. Adding Planck CMB data, we have a real hope for exploring the time variation of the equation of state, a critical guide to the underlying physics. Furthermore, mapping the recent expansion history of the universe can test the cosmological framework [\cite=li02], including higher dimensions, leading to new discoveries.
