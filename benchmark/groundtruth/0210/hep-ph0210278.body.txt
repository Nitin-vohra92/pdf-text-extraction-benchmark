Electromagnetic Properties of the Δ in the Large Nc and Chiral Limits

It has been known for some time that contracted (2Nf) spin-flavor symmetry of baryons [\cite=GerSak83] [\cite=GerSak84] [\cite=DasMan93a] [\cite=DasMan93b] [\cite=DasJenMan93] [\cite=DasJenMan94] [\cite=Jen93] which follows from large Nc QCD[\cite=Hoo74] [\cite=Wit79] relates various Δ and Δ-nucleon transition matrix elements to nucleon properties. These relations are model independent in the large Nc limit; they are fixed entirely from the symmetry. Subleading effects in 1 / Nc are not generally fixed. However for certain properties the leading 1 / Nc correction vanishes. For example, the nucleon-Δ transition magnetic moment [\cite=DasJenMan94] is fixed relative to the nucleon isovector moment up to relative order 1 / N2c.

Recently the contracted SU(2Nf) symmetry was used in an elegant way to relate other electromagnetic properties of the Δ and the N-Δ transition[\cite=BucLeb00] [\cite=BucHesLeb02] [\cite=BucLeb02], including the electric charge radius of the Δ[\cite=BucLeb00] [\cite=BucLeb02], the quadrupole moment of the Δ[\cite=BucHesLeb02] and the nucleon-Δ quadrupole transition moment[\cite=BucHesLeb02] [\cite=BucLeb02]. In a related work, the small value in E2/M1 electromagnetic decays of the Δ quadrupole transition moment to the magnetic transition moment) is explained qualitatively due to large Nc scaling behavior (which is shown to go as 1 / N2c) [\cite=JenJiMan02]. The scaling rules in ref. [\cite=JenJiMan02] and the relations in refs. [\cite=BucLeb00] [\cite=BucHesLeb02] [\cite=BucLeb02] are all model independent in the large Nc limit of QCD. To the extent that the physical world is close to the large Nc limit, one might expect the relations in refs. [\cite=BucLeb00] [\cite=BucHesLeb02] [\cite=BucLeb02] to hold to reasonable approximation in the real world and the qualitative explanation in ref. [\cite=JenJiMan02] to be valid.

However, while the 1 / Nc expansion may work well for generic nucleon or Δ properties, it is certainly possible that for certain observables, the model-dependent correction terms may be so large as to render the 1 / Nc expansion invalid. The present work argues on the basis of chiral considerations that one expects the electromagnetic quantities discussed in refs. [\cite=BucLeb00] [\cite=BucHesLeb02] [\cite=BucLeb02] [\cite=JenJiMan02] to have large corrections (excepting those relations which depend solely on isospin). These corrections are large enough in the real world to overwhelm the large Nc suppression factors for the Delta charge radius and quadrupole moment. The issue of the quadrupole transition moment is more subtle: the ratio E2/M1 is of order 1 / N2c; however, the coefficient multiplying the 1 / N2c is chirally enhanced and, hence, is parametrically large. Thus, the empirical smallness of this ratio depends in large part on fortuitous numerical factors.

One expects correction terms to the leading large Nc relations to be anomalously large if the quantity in question is dominated by large distances. The longest distance contributions to baryon structure comes from virtual pions which are anomalously light because the pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons. Chiral perturbation theory [\cite=BerKiaMei95] explains why such quantities are singular in the chiral limit. The singular behavior occurs due to infrared enhancements in pion loops which dominate the infrared because the pion is the only small excitation scale in the problem. As noted in refs. [\cite=CohBro92] [\cite=Coh95a] [\cite=Coh95b], however, this no longer true in the large Nc limit since the nucleon-Δ mass splitting scales as 1 / Nc [\cite=DasMan93a] [\cite=DasJenMan93].

The results of refs. [\cite=CohBro92] [\cite=Coh95a] [\cite=Coh95b] may be summarized as follows: i) Static nucleon properties which are singular in the chiral limit do not have a uniform combined chiral and large Nc limit, i.e. the chiral limit and large Nc limits do not commute. ii) There exists a well-defined limiting procedure for these quantities in which mπ  →  0  Nc  →    ∞   with Ncmπ fixed. iii) The leading singular behavior for these properties in this combined limit can be calculated from a one pion loop calculation in a generalization of chiral perturbation theory in which the Δ is kept as an explicit light degree of freedom and in which the pion-baryon coupling respect the contracted SU(4) symmetry of refs. [\cite=GerSak83] [\cite=GerSak84] [\cite=DasMan93a] [\cite=DasMan93b] [\cite=DasJenMan93] [\cite=DasJenMan94] [\cite=Jen93]. iv) The Skyrme model[\cite=BroZah86] and other hedgehog soliton models [\cite=Bir90] when treated using semiclassical quantization reproduce all of the results for these chirally singular quantities provided that these quantities are computed with the large Nc limit taken prior to the chiral limit.

These results imply that a typical static nucleon quantity in this category (which will be denoted here as Θ) can be written as

[formula]

where a is a numerical constant and [formula]; the functional form of fΘ depends on the quantum numbers of Θ and the number of pion propagators which contribute [\cite=explain]; the subleading terms are less singular than the first term in the limit mπ  →  0  Nc  →    ∞   with Ncmπ fixed. The function fΘ has the property,

[formula]

The various parameters scale with Nc as g2A  /  f2π  ~  Nc and Δ  ~  1 / Nc. The large Nc limit taken prior to the chiral limit yields fΘ(0) = 1 while the opposite ordering of limits give fΘ(  ∞  ) < 1, clearly demonstrating the noncommutation of the limits. The coefficient a can be found directly from the Skyrme model by matching the Skyrme model prediction for Θ with eq. ([\ref=typical]) while setting fθ to unity.

It is useful to establish a power counting scheme around the combined limit. This can be done in a manner analogous to that in the "small scale" expansion scheme which generalizes chiral perturbation theory to include explicit Δ degrees of freedom [\cite=HemHolKam98] [\cite=JenMan91]. In the present context if one denotes the small counting parameter as ε then

[formula]

where Λ is a typical hadronic scale. This power counting was constructed so that the leading power of a divergence in ε- 1 does not depend on how one approaches the combined large Nc and chiral limits. For example Θ in eq. ([\ref=typical]) will scale as ε- 2 regardless of the value of the ratio of Δ to mπ. This property allows one to extract the leading divergence with ε directly from the Skyrme model (which gives the correct behavior in the pure large Nc limit).

The analysis of refs. [\cite=CohBro92] [\cite=Coh95a] [\cite=Coh95b] can be extended to the study of Δ properties and properties of the nucleon-Δ transition in a rather straightforward manner as the arguments apply to all baryons in the I = J tower. The function fΘ which controls the interpolation between the two limits now can depend on the quantum numbers of the baryons (i.e. nucleon vs. Δ) and is not restricted to be less than unity. Again, the scaling behavior of an observable in the combined limit can be extracted from the Skyrme model. Here we foucus on the electric charge radii of the nucleon and Δ, the nucleon-Δ electric quadrupole transition moment and the electric quadrupole moment of the Δ. These are easily computed in any Skyrme type model with semiclassical quantization at leading order in the 1 / Nc expansion [\cite=CohBro92]:

[formula]

where the results hold to leading order in the 1 / Nc expansion. The values of Q, 〈r2〉I = 1 and 〈r2〉I = 0 all depend on the details of the model but all scale as N0c. Equation ([\ref=WE]) simply reflects the structure of the Wigner-Eckert theorem along with the large Nc result that the quadrupole operator at leading order is purely isovector. Note that eq. ([\ref=qme]) relates the nucleon-Δ electric quadrupole transition to the static quadrupole moment of the Δ.

The relations in eqs. ([\ref=qme]) and ([\ref=Qdef]) are equivalent to the leading order model independent results of refs. [\cite=BucHesLeb02] while eqs. ([\ref=rsqD]) and([\ref=rsqn]) encode the leading order relations of ref. [\cite=BucLeb00]. Note also, that the conclusion of ref. [\cite=JenJiMan02] that the E2/M1 ratio scales as N- 2c depends on the fact that the the nucleon-Δ electric quadruole matrix element scales as N0c; a result seen in Skyrme type models as seen above.

As mπ  →  0, the classical pion tail in the Skyrme profile becomes increasingly long-ranged and dominates the contributions to both the isovector charge radius and the electric quadrupole properties. As has long been known[\cite=CohBro86], the leading chiral behavior for both sets of quantities in these models can be directly related to the strength of the pion tail and thus to gA leading to additional relations:

[formula]

Note that both quantities diverge as 1 / mπ in the chiral limit and the arguments of refs. [\cite=CohBro92] [\cite=Coh95a] [\cite=Coh95b] apply. In terms of the power counting of eq. ([\ref=count]) they scale as,

[formula]

Since the scaling with ε does not depend on the ordering of limits, the scaling in eq. ([\ref=epsscal]) holds even away from the pure large Nc limit.

Equation ([\ref=epsscal]) is significant in the context of E2/M1 in Δ decays. This ratio was shown to go as N- 2c in ref. [\cite=JenJiMan02] with one factor of 1 / Nc coming from kinematics while the other came from the fact that Q  ~  N0c and the magnetic transition moment, μ, scaled as N- 1c. However, in the combined chiral and large Nc counting scheme, Q  ~  ε- 1 and μ  ~  ε- 1. Thus, in the combined counting E2/M1 ~  ε. There is one less power of suppression in the combined counting than in the pure 1 / Nc counting due to a chiral enhancement. Thus it is hard to argue that one understands the very small empirical E2/M1 ratio purely from scaling arguments. It is plausible that smallness is associated with the large numerical coefficients in the proportionality constant relating the electric quadrupole transition to the isovector charge radius in eq. ([\ref=prop]). These coefficients come from the detailed structure of the group theory and not from scaling behavior with mπ or Nc.

The quantities of interest diverge in the chiral limit and so the relations in eqs. ([\ref=rsqD]),([\ref=rsqn]) and ([\ref=qme]). are modified as one approaches the combined large Nc and chiral limits along the lines noted in refs. [\cite=CohBro92] [\cite=Coh95a] [\cite=Coh95b]. They can be expressed as:

[formula]

〈r2〉LNI = 1 and QLN are the expressions for 〈r2〉I = 1 and Q when the large Nc limit is taken prior to the chiral limit. As such they are calculable in the Skyrme model and are given in eq. ([\ref=prop]). The functions are fB,B',Θ(Δ / mπ) where B and B' are the initial and final baryon states and Θ denotes the quantity in question. These functions are calculable from one loop pion graphs. The detailed form of these will be given in a subsequent publication.

Equations ([\ref=rsqDm]), ([\ref=rsqnm]), ([\ref=qmem]) and ([\ref=q2mem]) imply large corrections to the model-independent large Nc predictions of refs. [\cite=BucLeb00] [\cite=BucHesLeb02] due to chiral enhancements. In the large Nc limit, the f functions are unity while for generic values of Δ / mπ they differ from one another by amounts of order unity . This spoils the large Nc proportionality rules of refs. [\cite=BucLeb00] [\cite=BucHesLeb02] relating Δ charge radii to nucleon charge radii and the Δ quadrupole moments to the nucleon-Δ transition moment. The relations depending solely on isospin are, of course, still valid.

In fact, the situation may be worse than this for the real world value of Δ / mπ  ~  2. The analytic structure of the functions fB,B',Θ(Δ / mπ)(Δ / mπ) is nontrivial. When B and B' are nucleons, the functions are analytic for all values Δ / mπ as can been from their explicit forms as given in refs. [\cite=CohBro92] [\cite=Coh95a] [\cite=Coh95b]. This reflects the lack of open channels. Similarly, when B and B' are either both Δ states or one nucleon and one Δ, they will be analytic for values of Δ / mπ < 1 as there are no open channels. However, for Δ / mπ  ≤  1 the pion-nucleon channel is open. This raises a conceptual problem in the analysis since the analysis in refs. [\cite=CohBro92] [\cite=Coh95a] [\cite=Coh95b] is strictly valid for only static quantities and it is unclear how to define static quantities of the Δ when it is coupled to an open channel. Mathematically, this will be reflected by nonanalytic behavior in fB,B',Θ(Δ / mπ)(Δ / mπ). If one continues the forms of the fB,B',Θ to the regime where Δ / mπ  <  1, one will encounter imaginary parts. These represent the ambiguity in defining the values of the quantity for the Δ resonance given the need to separate the resonance contribution from a continuum background. Such a separation is always model dependent. Provided the imaginary part is small, however, this ambiguity will be small and meaningful extraction of Δ properties are possible. For the case of the electric quadrupole transition from nucleon to Δ there will be an imaginary part, but there is no reason to expect it to dominate. Calculations of E2/M1 for the Δ nucleon transition have significan imaginary parts but they do not dominate [\cite=ButSavSpring93].

The case of the Δ charge radius and Δ quadrupole moment are different; one expects very large imaginary parts in the open-channel regime and thus it may be difficult to relate these quantities to experimental observables. To see this, consider the regime very close to threshold, i.e. where |1  -  Δ2 / m2π| <  < 1. One can develop an effective theory valid for this regime. The central physical idea is that below threshold in this regime, the pion is effectively nonrelativistic at long distances. Thus, the long distance part of the Δ can be visualized as a nonrelativistic p-wave between a pion and a nucleon and as such it is described by a wave function which goes as [formula] at asymptotic distances. From this it is easy to deduce that in the vicinity of Δ / mπ  =  1 the functions scale as

[formula]

where a and b are constants.

As one approaches the threshold from the bound region, the charge radius and the quadrupole moment both diverge. As one moves into the unbound region the functions are totally dominated by their imaginary parts and as such the quantity becomes ambiguous. One way to understand this ambiguity is in terms of contributions from the background. The background is a p-wave nucleon-pion continuum state which extends out to spatial infinity. Thus, changes in the model-dependent separation between resonance and background can move arbitrarily large contributions to these quantites from the continuum into the resonance. In this circumstance it is not clear how to extract the Δ resonance contribution for these quantities. As one continues well above threshold and outside the region of this effective theory it is remains unclear exactly how one should interpret the Δ charge radius and quadrupole moment. Reference [\cite=BucHesLeb02] notes the practical difficulties in extracting the static quadrupole moment of the Δ from experiment. It remains an open question as to whether there exists continuations of the expressions for these quantities which is both valid above threshold and is meaningful in the sense that they can be related to experimentally measurable quantities. Thus the interplay between the chiral and large Nc limits not only alters the relations of refs. [\cite=BucLeb00] [\cite=BucHesLeb02], it also makes the interpretation of the charge radius and quadrupole moment of the Δ problematic in the real world where Δ / mπ > 1.

In summary, the interplay between the chiral and large Nc limits implies that taking a combined limit greatly alters relations between chirally sensitive nucleon, Δ and nucleon-Δ electromagnetic properties such as charge radii and quadrupole matrix elements from those which have been derived previously in a pure large-Nc limit. The pure large Nc relations become accurate when Δ / mπ <  < 1 while in the real world Δ / mπ  ~  2. Moreover, the Δ charge radius and electric quadrupole moment become ambiguous for Δ / mπ > 1. The E2/M1 ratio for the nucleon-Δ transition is shown to scale as ε in the combined large Nc and chiral expansions as opposed to N- 2c in the pure large Nc expansion. It is less suppressed in the combined limit making it more difficult to understand why the ratio is so small.
