Forward-Backward Multiplicity Correlations in Symmetric and Asymmetric High Energy Collisions

The analysis of multiplicity correlations between two different regions of phase-space provides important information on the dynamics of multiparticle production processes.

Due to space limitations, the reader is referred for all details and references to papers [\cite=RU:FB] and [\cite=RU:FBasymm].

I will at first consider symmetric reactions (like  annihilation, pp and p collisions) with a symmetric choice of the forward (F) and backward (B) regions: in  annihilations the F regions is chosen randomly between those defined by a plane through the collision point and perpendicular to the thrust axis; in hh collisions the collision axis is chosen as reference. B is always the symmetric region. The forward-backward (FB) correlation strength, bFB, is defined as usual:

[formula]

where nF if the number of particles in F and nB the number of particles in B. A more precise study of the correlations investigates the dependence of the average number of particles in one hemisphere on the number of particles in the opposite one, say n̄F(nB).

In hh collisions the correlation strength grows logarithmically with the c.m. energy [formula] and is rather large (from 0.16 at 63 GeV to 0.7 at 1800 GeV); in  annihilation the correlation strength is rather small (0.1 at 91 GeV). Furthermore, bFB was measured in 2-jet and 3-jet events separately at LEP1 and was found to be compatible with zero in both cases.

The mechanism of the weighted superposition of different classes of events, which was found to describe the shoulder structure of multiplicity distributions and the oscillations of their Hq moments, can be tested on FB correlations. The classes of events are defined according to the reaction considered: in hh collisions we define soft events (events without mini-jets) as class 1, and semi-hard events (events with mini-jets) as class 2; in  annihilation, class 1 are two-jet events, class 2 are three-jet events.

The starting point is the weighted superposition equation for the joint distribution of nF and nB particles:

[formula]

where α is the fraction of events of class 1. Based on the above equation and symmetry properties, it is possible to obtain explicitly a general formula for bFB, which depends of course on the first two moments of the general multiplicity distribution (MD) in each class i = 1,2 (namely the average multiplicity [formula] and the dispersion Dn,i) and on the correlation strength in each class, bi:

[formula]

We apply first our result to OPAL data, setting b1  =  b2  =  0 as the data suggest. We take the values of the moments of the MD in each class from previous fits and obtain bFB  =  0.101 to be compared with the OPAL result 0.103  ±  0.007. Thus we conclude that the weighted superposition mechanism describes well FB correlations in  annihilation.

We now turn to p collisions at 546 GeV (UA5); the experimental result is 0.58  ±  0.01. Taking the shoulder description from a fit to the overall MD, one finds that Eq. ([\ref=eq:general]) with b1  =  b2  =  0 gives a too small result, indicating that FB correlations are needed in each substructure. On the other hand, if particles in each substructure were totally uncorrelated, one would get a result which is much larger than experimentally found. We conclude that particles are emitted with partial correlation, as already suggested by UA5.

Since we have succesfully used a two-step production process to describe multiparticle dynamics, leading to the negative binomial (NB) shape of the MD, and which naturally accommodates partial correlation, we apply it to the study of FB correlations in a generalised way:

In the first step, N independent objects (generalised clans) are produced according to a given MD, P(N).

In the second step, particles are produced within each clan according to a MD Q(nc).

This two-step process is used to describe each component (with possibly different parameters in each step): from now on, all our formulae refer to each component separately, but we drop the component index in the formulae. We further assume that clans are produced independently in rapidity thus the distribution in the number of forward clans, NF, at fixed total number of clan, N, is binomial. The successful NB parametrisation of the data is obtained when P(N) is the Poisson distribution and Q(nc) is the logarithmic distribution.

Consider now the situation in which particles produced by an F (B) clan all remain in the F (B) region: if clans follow a Poisson MD, as is implied by the very good fit to the data obtained with the NB distribution (NBD), one obtains b  =  0, independently of the details of the MD inside clans. It is therefore necessary to allow clans to leak particles from one hemisphere to the other. In order to do this, a new parameter is introduced, p, which is defined as the average fraction of particles in a clan which remain in the same region and do not leak away to the opposite one. As clans are classified F or B according to where the majority of the particles fall, one has 0.5  ≤  p  ≤  1. We also define q  =  1 - p.

The general result is now

[formula]

where γ is the covariance between F and B multiplicities within a clan. The above formula simplifies considerably in the case of the NBD, and even further if we assume that particles within a clan fall in F or B independently, since then [formula]:

[formula]

where β is related to the average number of particles per clan: [formula].

We can now use experimental data to extract the values of the leakage parameter p which we do not know, then we use the NBD structure to reproduce the almost linear relation between [formula] and nB. Since at 63 GeV the mini-jet sample can be considered negligible, we use only one component and obtain [formula]. Because the number of particles per clans in the soft component varies very little from 63 to 900 GeV, we assume now that also the leakage parameter is essentially constant in the GeV region. Using this value for [formula] and the measured value of the correlation strength at 900 GeV, we can now calculate [formula]. The just mentioned values can then be used to predict the behaviour of the correlation strength with energy: e.g., it can be shown that it will not continue to grow linearly with [formula] in the multi-TeV region if the leakage parameter [formula] remains constant [\cite=RU:FB].

Within the same two-step process framework, we can extend our formulae to the case in which either the reaction is asymmetric (e.g. consider proton-nucleus or nucleus A-nucleus B with A ≠   B) or the F and B regions are asymmetrically defined, or both cases are realised [\cite=RU:FBasymm]. In order to proceed, we must allow for the possibility that the average leakage from F to B may be different from the average leakage from B to F, and thus introduce different parameters: pF  ≠  pB; we must also allow for the possibility that, on average, more clans are produced in one region than in the other; we call r the average fraction of clans produced in the F region: in general r  ≠  1 / 2. The symmetric case is recovered for pF  =  pB and r  =  1 / 2.

Using the formalism of generating functions, we arrive at formulae for the joint MD in the general case. The joint generating function (GF) for each component in Eq. ([\ref=eq:combo]) is

[formula]

Since clans are Poisson distributed and independent of each other, the joint GF for NF forward clans and NB backward clans is

[formula]

where [formula] is the overall average number of clans. Calling gc,I(zF,zB) the GF for the joint MD of particles from one forward (I = F) or one backward (I = B) clan, we make use again of the independence among clans and obtain the general formula:

[formula]

The special case in which the MD is of NB type is of particular interest. In that case in fact one has simply (we assume that particles within a clan fall in F or B independently)

[formula]

where [formula] is the GF for the logarithmic distribution of parameter β:

[formula]

The generating function for the joint probability of nF and nB particles is then given by

[formula]

This formalism can be used to describe FB multiplicity correlations in very general terms. It is interesting to point out a few properties:

The marginal distribution is the convolution of two NBD's, thus it can be shown that it is an infinitely divisible distribution.

When r = 1 / 2, one obtain for the GF of the marginal distribution a simple correction to the NBD generating function; e.g., for the forward marginal GF:

[formula]

[formula] is not a linear function of nB, and vice-versa, except for the particular cases pi = 1 / 2 and pi = 1, (i=F,B); examples are shown in [\cite=RU:FBasymm].

In conclusion, general formulae for the FB multiplicity correlation strength and F and B joint distributions generating functions have been given in the framework of the superposition mechanism of two weighted MD's for different classes of events. Assuming NB regularity behaviour for 2- and 3-jet samples of events in  annihilation at LEP energy, results obtained by OPAL collaborations are correctly reproduced within experimental errors. In pp collisions the FB multiplicity correlation strengths in the two substructures (soft and semi-hard events) turn out to be quite important: in particular an interesting connection is found between the particle populations within clans, particle leakage from clans in one hemisphere to the opposite hemisphere and superposition effect between different substructure of the collision. This finding favours structures with larger particle populations per clans and the decrease of the average number of clans.

It has been shown that assuming different particle leakage percentages (pB  ≠  pF) for binomially generated particles from clans in one hemisphere to the opposite one and asymmetric (r  ≠  1 / 2) distribution in the two hemispheres of binomially generated clans, a general formula for the generating function of the joint (nF,nB)-charged particle multiplicity distribution for each class of events (or substructure) in asymmetric reactions can be obtained when the total multiplicity distribution is of negative binomial type, and can be easily generalised to any discrete infinitely divisible multiplicity distribution. This search is relevant for the study of forward-backward multiplicity correlations in non-identical heavy ion collisions and in proton-nucleus collisions. Accordingly, the newly introduced particle leakage and asymmetry parameters can be used for classifying different classes of collisions.
