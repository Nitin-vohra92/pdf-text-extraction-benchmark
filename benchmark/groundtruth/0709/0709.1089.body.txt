Universality of the diffusion wake in the gauge-string duality

Introduction

Consider a quark moving at constant velocity through an infinite, static, thermal medium. Assume that the temperature is above the confinement transition, so the medium is a plasma of gluons and whatever dynamical matter there may be. The quark loses energy to the plasma, but where does this energy go? Sufficiently far from the quark, a complete account of energy dissipation should be possible within the framework of linearized hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamics is usually applicable at length scales much larger than the mean free path of thermal quasi-particles within the plasma, which is to say some multiple of 1 / T. (We set c  =  kB  =  1 throughout.) The applicability of linearized hydrodynamics depends on being far enough from the quark for the perturbations to be very small. It is well understood (see for example [\cite=Casalderrey-Solana:2004qm]) that if one assumes axial symmetry of the fluid flow around the direction of motion of the quark, then the equations of linearized hydrodynamics partially decouple into a pair of equations describing compressive waves (sound) and a third equation describing shearing modes (the diffusion wake). Figure [\ref=WakeAndBoom] shows a typical geometry for these two modes.

We denote the total energy of the moving quark as E. The total energy gained by the plasma is given by Pt  =    -  dE / dt, where in our conventions dE / dt  <  0 means that energy is flowing from the quark into the plasma. Assuming that sound and diffusion are the only modes of energy loss from the quark, the total power delivered to the plasma is where Ps and Pd correspond respectively to the energy lost to sound and the energy lost to diffusion.

We claim that in a fairly broad range of string theory constructions and using a sensible but non-unique way of separating diffusion modes from other modes, The relative minus sign means that the diffusion wake supplies energy to the quark. We prove this in section [\ref=DIFFUSION] for any theory admitting a holographic dual asymptotic to AdS[formula] that can be described in terms of Einstein gravity coupled to scalars with no more than two derivatives in the action. In our demonstration, the quark has to be infinitely massive, and it is represented as a string trailing into the five-dimensional dual geometry. The tension of the string is an arbitrary function of the scalars.

Putting and together, we learn that This means that energy flows into sound waves at a rate which is 1 + 1 / v2 times as fast as the total outflow of energy from the quark. The diffusion wake supplies energy to the quark in just the right amount to balance equation . In section [\ref=SOUND] we show that we do not need to assume in order to demonstrate , at least in the case of a single scalar. The result holds for all v between 0 and 1, but the most interesting case is when v is greater than the speed of sound cs, in which case there is a sonic boom.

The result was demonstrated for N = 4 super-Yang-Mills with a large number of colors and a large 't Hooft coupling in [\cite=Gubser:2007ga], which followed upon a number of works by ourselves and other authors [\cite=Herzog:2006gh] [\cite=Gubser:2006bz] [\cite=Friess:2006aw] [\cite=Yarom:2007ap] [\cite=Gubser:2007nd] [\cite=Gubser:2007xz] [\cite=Chesler:2007an]; parallel lines of development have included [\cite=Sin:2004yx] [\cite=Liu:2006ug] [\cite=Casalderrey-Solana:2006rq] [\cite=Sin:2006yz] [\cite=Liu:2006he] [\cite=Gubser:2006nz] [\cite=Casalderrey-Solana:2007qw] [\cite=Lin:2007pv]. We note in particular the close relation of [\cite=Casalderrey-Solana:2006rq] to the drag force results of [\cite=Herzog:2006gh] [\cite=Gubser:2006bz].

The backgrounds we consider can accommodate arbitrary speed of sound (limited, perhaps, by [formula]), including a speed of sound that varies as a function of temperature. Thus our result has a degree of universality which encourages us to think that it might be compared with data from heavy ion collisions. As we explain in section [\ref=DISCUSSION], a diffusion wake as strong as we find poses a challenge to our understanding of the experimental situation.

The diffusion wake

The action we start with is where Lφ is the scalar Lagrangian

[formula]

Gμν is the metric on the bulk spacetime M, and gαβ is the metric induced from it on the string worldsheet W. We will consider backgrounds which are asymptotically anti-de Sitter, with [formula] near the conformal boundary of AdS. The functions V(φ), [formula] and [formula] are arbitrary, except for the requirement that V(φ) should have a local (negative) maximum for a finite value of the scalars, [formula], in order for the desired anti-de Sitter asymptotics to arise near the conformal boundary.

When the string is not present, the backgrounds of interest take the form This ansatz is the result of assuming translation invariance in the [formula] directions and rotational invariance in the [formula] directions. It is assumed that h  →  1 at the conformal boundary where also r  →  0 and α  →  L / r. There is an event horizon at r  =  rH  >  0 where h(rH) = 0. The tt and ii components of the Einstein equations (where i runs over the three components of [formula]) provide us with In addition, the rr component of the Einstein equation imposes a zero-energy constraint:

The system of equations and has been extensively studied, and we briefly summarize aspects of the relevant literature. It was shown in [\cite=Gubser:2000nd] that a solution of the form can exist in the case of a single scalar only if V(φH)  <  V(φB) with [formula]. Numerical construction of such black holes was first reported on in [\cite=Gubser:2000nd] for a specific potential. Further numerical solutions were exhibited more explicitly in [\cite=Friess:2005zp] and later in [\cite=PufuUnpublished] [\cite=Buchel:2007vy] [\cite=PandoZayas:2006sa] [\cite=Aharony:2007vg] [\cite=Mahato:2007zm], where analyses of thermodynamic quantities were also given. Following [\cite=Buchel:2000ch], some approximate, analytical results for high temperature black holes were obtained in [\cite=Gubser:2001ri] [\cite=Buchel:2001gw] [\cite=Buchel:2003ah].

The trailing string

In [\cite=Herzog:2006gh] [\cite=Gubser:2006bz] the drag force acting on a moving quark at constant velocity v through a plasma has been calculated using AdS/CFT. It is straightforward to generalize the drag force calculation of [\cite=Herzog:2006gh] [\cite=Gubser:2006bz] to the backgrounds described above. Various generalizations exist in the literature, for example [\cite=Herzog:2006se] [\cite=Talavera:2006tj] [\cite=MichalogiorgakisPhD]. The one we will describe here is quite a modest extension of previously published results, which allows for an arbitrary dependence on the scalar field φI coming from a Kaluza-Klein reduction of the ten dimensional Dilaton and metric. The ansatz for the trailing string is and the string action takes the form The conserved momentum conjugate to ξ is The drag force exerted by the plasma on the quark is Note that πξ  >  0, so F1 is negative, meaning in a direction opposite the quark's velocity. The total rate of energy loss from the quark to the plasma is which is a positive quantity.

Perturbations in axial gauge

The trailing string sources the metric and the scalar fields coupled to it. Treating κ25 as a small parameter, we may evaluate the response of the various fields to the string to linear order in κ25.

We consider linearized fluctuations around a background of the form [\eqref=BHansatz]. These fluctuations will be expressed as In axial gauge one sets δGrν  =  0 for all ν. We further define where the pre-factor κ25α2 is for convenience.

As in [\cite=Friess:2006fk], we study the linearized fluctuations in Fourier space with a co-moving ansatz: Because of axial symmetry, the Fourier coefficients Hmn can only depend on wave-number [formula] through k1 and [formula]. Let's fix this symmetry by setting k3 = 0 and [formula]. The three components (H03, H13, and H23) are odd under reflection through the plane perpendicular to [formula]. The trailing string is symmetric under this reflection, so it doesn't source the odd metric components. We may therefore set them to zero. The other components (H00, H01, H02, H11, H12, H22, and H33) are even, and they are all sourced non-trivially by the trailing string. A substantial simplification of the equations of motion arises from forming the following linear combinations, which are essentially the same as the ones in [\cite=Friess:2006fk]:

[formula]

[formula]

The equation of motion for A decouples from all other metric components as well as from the scalars. The equations of motion for [formula] mix with one another but decouple from A and [formula] as well as the scalars. The equations of motion for [formula] couple to the scalars. The defining relations - are equivalent to It will prove useful to have these inverse relations ready to hand when we want to extract components of the gauge theory's stress energy tensor.

We shall restrict our attention to the vector modes since these are the only ones which will contribute to the diffusion wake. To see this consider the contribution of the moving quark to the Poynting vector Recall that we employ mostly plus signature and that 〈T0i〉  =  0 in the static background. We use [formula] in preference to [formula] for simplicity, keeping in mind that the non-zero Poynting vector owes wholly to the presence of the moving quark. Using holographic renormalization (see appendix [\ref=HOLORG]) we can show that It is useful to decompose the Fourier components of the Poynting vector into a longitudinal part and a transverse part

[formula]

where [formula]. The [formula] component is orthogonal to [formula] and lies in the same plane as [formula] and [formula] due to the azimuthal symmetry around the direction of motion of the quark. It is well understood (see for example [\cite=Casalderrey-Solana:2004qm]) that the diffusion wake is described in terms of [formula]. Referring to , we see that the contribution of E2 to [formula] is in a direction parallel to the wave-number [formula], whereas the contribution to D1 is orthogonal to [formula]. In short, E2 controls SL while D1 controls [formula]. Using [\eqref=Hrules] and one finds

[formula]

The linearized Einstein equations in axial gauge imply the following second order equations for the D modes, In [\eqref=Deqns], the real-valued function ξ(r) is determined by solving [\eqref=pixiDef]. Additionally there is a first order constraint, Note that the source for the constraint equations [\eqref=Dconstraint] is of order O(k- 1) while that of the second order equations [\eqref=Deqns] is of order O(1).

Large distance asymptotics

We are interested in the large distance asymptotics of the energy momentum tensor. In this regime one would expect that linearized hydrodynamics will be a good approximation. The equations for vector perturbations simplify drastically when only the leading order terms in small k are retained: the equations of motion become and the first order constraint becomes The most general solution of the equations of motion consistent with the boundary condition Di  →  0 at the conformal boundary of the asymptotically AdS background is Because h  →  0 at the horizon, D2 has a logarithmic divergence there. Requiring that the metric fluctuations are finite at the horizon implies d2 = 0. This is equivalent to taking the k  →  0 limit of the usual horizon boundary condition where outgoing modes are forbidden. A more detailed discussion of the horizon boundary condition can be found in section [\ref=SOUND]. Plugging into with d2 = 0 leads immediately to

The diffusion wake is a long, narrow, forward-directed stream of fluid along the negative x1 axis (see figure [\ref=WakeAndBoom]). Its narrowness in the x2 and x3 directions means that, in Fourier space, we can take k2 and k3 large compared to k1, effectively setting [formula]. In this limit, we find a simple limiting form for [formula]: To Fourier transform [formula] to real space, we need a prescription for passing the k1 = 0 pole. Passing it in the upper half plane results in a stream of energy along the negative x1 axis, while passing it in the lower half plane results in a stream of energy along the positive x1 axis--ahead of the quark. This latter possibility is unphysical in a steady-state solution. We find where the integration is along real values, ε  >  0, and In [\cite=Gubser:2007ga] [\cite=Gubser:2007xz], it was observed that for the case of N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory, effects of order O(1) lead to extra terms which correspond to replacing ε in by [formula]. This replacement broadens the wake from a singular structure along the negative x1 axis to a stream inside a parabolic surface of revolution, as shown in figure [\ref=WakeAndBoom].

The energy carried by the narrow stream described in per unit time is given by The first surface integral in [\eqref=DiffusionPower] is over the boundary of a large volume enclosing the moving quark, and [formula] is an outward pointing area element. This integral can be evaluated immediately, using , to give the result -  πξ / v. In writing the second integral, we aim to reproduce the same result by integrating the full Poynting vector [formula] over a carefully chosen surface Δ. From we might expect that Δ can be any sufficiently small surface intersecting the negative real axis. But in the full Poynting vector, there is viscosity broadening, and there are also non-hydrodynamical effects close to the quark [\cite=Yarom:2007ap] [\cite=Gubser:2007nd] [\cite=Yarom:2007ni]. A good choice of Δ is shown in figure [\ref=disk], where one takes [formula] with [formula]. The large [formula] limit insures that linearized hydrodynamics is valid, and the specified range of [formula] insures that the integration over Δ picks up the entire contribution from the diffusion wake and nothing else. The area element [formula] points toward negative x1 to agree with directionality of [formula] in the first integral in . Combining [\eqref=TotalEnergyLoss], , and , we have This is the result we advertised in . In section [\ref=NONCONSERVATION] we will describe another way of evaluating Pd starting from the divergence of the stress tensor.

Sound modes

To describe the sound modes, we need to know the first column of the stress energy tensor in the small momentum limit. For purposes of simplicity, we restrict attention to a single scalar, so that Referring to , we see that to determine the Poynting vector, it is enough to understand the asymptotics of E2. This field couples non-trivially both to the scalar and to E1, E3, and E4. However, in the small momentum approximation a simplification occurs: two of the equations of motion decouple, giving

[formula]

The other equations of motion, also at order O(1 / k), are The first order constraints couple together all the Ei's and the scalar: where we have again written only the leading terms in a 1 / k expansion. Solving [\eqref=E:E2] and [\eqref=E:E4] together with the requirement that the metric fluctuations vanish at the asymptotic AdS boundary, we get where we have used the equation of motion for h [\eqref=E:BHeomsa] in the equalities on the right hand side, and defined [formula]. To avoid a logarithmic singularity at the event horizon, one must set e4 = 0.

The alert reader will have noted that is in precise analogy to . The horizon boundary condition e4 = 0 is likewise in analogy to d2 = 0. The justification of these boundary conditions is actually somewhat subtle. At finite k, the possible leading near-horizon behaviors of E4 and D2 are h±  ivk1 / h1. The minus sign corresponds to an outgoing wave and the plus sign corresponds to an infalling wave. Usually, the appropriate boundary condition is to suppress the outgoing wave. But in a small k expansion, [formula]. The relative factor of k1 means that the logarithmic term cannot be visible in a leading small k treatment. Another way to understand why one must forbid both the infalling and outgoing waves is that the leading order small k analysis does not know about viscosity, so it also doesn't know about the arrow of time; thus the boundary conditions, at this order, should be symmetric between infalling and outgoing waves.

Although it is unimportant for our subsequent analysis, we note for completeness that the A equation of motion completely decouples from the other modes and the scalar fields for all values of k. At order 1 / k, it takes the simple form As with D2 and E4, the horizon boundary condition forces A = O(1).

Static peturbations of the horizon

The equations - are too complicated to solve in general as we did for the D set. Furthermore, equations [\eqref=EEStatic] describe not only the response of the metric to the string, but also static deformations of the black hole background. Although such deformations are not directly related to the response to the moving quark, it is helpful to describe them explicitly on the dual gravity side as a warm-up to the treatment of sound modes. More precisely, we want to consider perturbations that are invariant under translations in the [formula] directions and rotations in the [formula] dimensions. This allows us to set H11  =  H22  =  H33 and to set all off-diagonal components of the metric to zero. So E2  =  E4  =  0, while E1 and E3 may be defined as in . It is straightforward to show that the equations of motion take the form and that the zero-energy constraint (coming from the rr Einstein equation) takes the form . The expectation is that there is only one allowed deformation, and it corresponds to uniformly changing the temperature in the gauge theory.

These equations are still impossible to integrate explicitly for general V(φ). However, one may perform a near horizon analysis by switching the independent variable from r to h and expanding We find six linearly independent solutions: Solutions A and B are exact, while the others, as expressed in , are accurate only to the first two non-trivial orders in small h. Applying the constraint equation [\eqref=E:ConstraintH] to the solutions , one finds that the D solution is disallowed, and a relation is enforced between the E and F solutions. The upshot is that for small h, where e1, ẽ1, e3, and δφH are integration constants. In principle, three of these constants can be fixed in terms of the fourth by integrating E1, E3, and δφ out to the conformal boundary of AdS5 and imposing boundary conditions there corresponding to the absence of any deformations of the lagrangian. This means that the boundary conditions on the asymptotic AdS boundary are such that E1 and E3 are O(r4) near the conformal boundary, while δφ is O(rΔ), where Δ is the dimension of the operator dual to φ. Once these conditions from the conformal boundary are imposed, what remains is just one static deformation of the black hole, as expected on general grounds.

For the AdS5-Schwarzschild background, the differential equations can be integrated out to the conformal boundary of anti-de Sitter space, and the boundary conditions there can be imposed explicitly. They are e1  =    -  ẽ1  =   - 2e3, with no constraint on δφH because the scalar and graviton perturbations decouple. To show all this, simply note that the terms shown explicitly in provide an exact solution for AdS[formula]-Schwarzschild. For other backgrounds, one usually cannot explicitly perform the integration from the horizon to the conformal boundary. Generically, the scalar and graviton mix, and the three constraints at the conformal boundary involve all of e1, ẽ1, e3, and δφH.

Since we can not integrate the equations, we proceed by expressing the various integration constants in terms of the entropy and temperature. The solutions [\eqref=ConstrainedStatic] imply that the metric fluctuations are given by (recall that H11  =  H22  =  H33.) Note that despite the [formula] singular terms in [\eqref=ConstrainedStatic], the fluctuations are finite at the horizon. In we have suppressed all terms beyond the ones that affect the variation in the entropy and temperature. The entropy is straightforward to compute: the perturbed metric to order κ25 takes the form So the entropy per coordinate volume of [formula] is evaluated at the horizon. Thus Determining the variation of the temperature is a bit more subtle because Gtt and Grr depend non-analytically on h after the perturbation. One way to proceed is to change variables from r to [formula] in such a way that the perturbed metric becomes One easily finds all up to O(κ45) corrections which we ignore. The Hawking temperature of the unperturbed background is easily seen to be 1 / 4πr1. Suppose we expand [formula] in a power series in h̃: Then the Hawking temperature of the perturbed background is Therefore According to simple thermodynamic arguments summarized in [\cite=Buchel:2005nt], as long as there are no chemical potentials present, the speed of sound should be As a check, one may subsitute ẽ1 = 2e3 for AdS-Schwarzschild and recover c2s  =  1 / 3. It will also prove interesting to note that the first law of thermodynamics predicts where E is the energy density and we again assume that no chemical potential is present.

Small momentum asymptotics

A striking feature of the full O(1 / k) equations - is that the equations of motion for E1, E3, and δφ, together with the zero energy constraint , are the same as for static deformations. The two extra non homogeneous constraints [\eqref=E:Constraint1] and [\eqref=E:Constraint2] will determine e2 and one other integration constant. Heuristically, this means that we can describe sound waves as a modulation of the static deformation, plus some profile for E2 that incorporates non-zero Poynting vector. Technically, it means we can set This is not really a constraint on ẽ1, instead we are simply trading ẽ1 / e3 for [formula] as a parameter for describing temperature-deformations. Only by fully integrating the differential equations and  and imposing appropriate constraints at the conformal boundary could we determine c2s. Plugging and  into , and imposing e4 = 0 as well as , one obtains a pair of linear equations in e2 and e3. Solving these equations leads to

Using and  in [\eqref=HolographicPoynting] we obtain the Poynting vector to leading order in small k: When [formula], reduces to the leading order results found in [\cite=Gubser:2007ga]. It is natural to identify the contribution of sound modes as where Defining [formula] as in , we see that [formula].

In order to completely characterize the energy dissipation, we need also to compute the fluctuations in the energy density. This is difficult to work out in a general setting because the Brown-York tensor probably does not correctly capture 〈T00〉 owing to effects from holographic renormalization. Also one apparently has to solve for E1 and E3 out to the boundary, which seems impossible. But there is a simple shortcut--though admittedly heuristic: it is simply to use the thermodynamic relation δE  =  Tδs in the [formula]-th Fourier mode. This should work at leading order in small k. The result, carried over directly from , is When [formula], reduces to the leading order results found in [\cite=Gubser:2007ga].

Non-conservation of the stress tensor

The results and  are enough information to determine the first row of the stress tensor completely at small k. More precisely, consider the subtracted stress energy tensor expectation value at time t = 0 (still in the rest frame of the plasma): where 〈Tmn〉bath is from the infinite, static, thermal medium. What we have computed, in Fourier space, with k3 = 0 and [formula], is (Recall that we use [formula] for the response of the Poynting vector to the string instead of [formula].) Rotational invariance around the [formula] axis determines δT0m for other values of [formula]. As discussed in [\cite=Gubser:2007ga] [\cite=Friess:2006fk], the failure of the conservation law ∂mδTmn  =  0 is a good measure of energy dissipation from the quark. The non-conservation law can be expressed in Fourier space as where (setting k0 =  - vk1 comes from the co-moving ansatz.) The right hand side of was computed in [\eqref=TotalEnergyLoss]. It is the total rate at which the quark deposits energy into the plasma: a positive quantity. A check on our computations so far is to plug , , and into and check that the right hand side agrees with . It does.

As in [\cite=Gubser:2007ga], we associate δE entirely with dissipation into sound waves. This makes sense because, in a linearized hydrodynamical analysis, the diffusion wake shows up only in the Poynting vector. Thus we have a splitting where There is an associated splitting of the non-conservation effect: We regard as a definition of Ps and Pd. It is immediate from the preceding discussion that which is the result that we advertised from the start.

It is clear that in splitting up δT0m as in we are making choices rather than doing something inevitable. To justify this splitting we note that in linearized hydrodynamics, neglecting viscosity, the Fourier space form describing sound waves involves ω2  -  c2sk2, while the analogous form for the diffusion wake is just ω (see for example [\cite=Casalderrey-Solana:2004qm]). This precisely coincides with our choice of sound and diffusion modes in equations [\eqref=SimpleWake], [\eqref=SoundModes] and [\eqref=ThermoDeltaE]. The diffusion part of the stress tensor is exactly the long, narrow stream of plasma behind the quark, which we justified in a different way in the discussion leading up to .

Furthermore, when v  >  cs, the split we use leads to exponential suppression of all components of δT0msound and δT0mdiffuse for x1  >  0, which is sensible because this region is causally inaccessible to sound waves emanating from the quark. Another natural split is to associate contributions to the stress tensor from the D set purely with the diffusion wake, and contributions from the E set purely with sound modes. This is the same transverse/longitudinal split discussed in [\cite=Casalderrey-Solana:2004qm] and it leads to power law tails of components of the stress tensor cancelling delicately between diffusion and sound modes.

It is interesting to note that when cs  →  0, the total perturbation in the stress tensor becomes with our usual convention that k3 = 0 and [formula]. In position space, which describes energy deposition and flow only in the path of the quark. There is of course some viscosity broadening, presumably visible at higher orders in k, but no pressure broadening--because there is no pressure. Sound waves don't really exist in this limit. But the diffusion wake, as defined in , is completely insensitive to the speed of sound. Its form and its strength appear to be a universal feature of string theory constructions starting from Einstein gravity coupled to strings and scalars.

Relation to linearized hydrodynamics

The stress energy tensor of the thermal plasma is conserved except at the location of the quark: In Fourier space,

[formula]

where as in . The n = 0 component of is precisely . From [\eqref=DragForce] and [\eqref=TotalEnergyLoss] we read off We emphasize that our derivation of , for n = 0, did not directly use a hydrodynamic approximation: it came from the small k limit of an AdS/CFT computation. The purpose of this section is to understand how the AdS/CFT computation matches with linearized hydro, including (for N = 4) a sub-leading effect in small k.

The constitutive relations for linearized hydro amount to

[formula]

where (Recall that we use mostly plus signature.) The equations of motion for linearized hydrodynamics are

[formula]

But now there is no reason why the source term Jnhydro should be pointlike. Instead, in position space, Jnhydro probably has width comparable to Γs (the attenuation length) and must be parametrized in some fashion. The authors of [\cite=Casalderrey-Solana:2004qm] [\cite=CasalderreySolana:2006sq] used an equivalent of In [\cite=Casalderrey-Solana:2004qm] [\cite=CasalderreySolana:2006sq] two scenarios where considered. In scenario 1, e0  =  vg0 is a Gaussian in real space with width Γs, while g1 = 0. Scenario 2 corresponds to the opposite extreme, e0 = g0 = 0 and g1 a Gaussian with width Γs.

A natural though non-unique prescription in matching our results to linearized hydro is to set for m = 0,1,2,3 and then to use and  to determine the other components of δTmnhydro. If we follow this procedure to order O(k- 1), see and , we find

[formula]

If we plug into , we obtain an expression for Jnhydro coinciding with with Fourier transforming the leading terms shown in leads to position results which are delta-functions, as in . Because of the explicit factors of k in , non-vanishing e0 and g0 tend to dominate over non-vanishing g1 at sufficiently long distances. More specifically, given e0, g0 and g1 in Fourier space, one may define a dimensionless figure of merit, such that γ1  ≪  1 favors scenario 1 and γ1  ≫  1 favors scenario 2. R is a typical distance at which one is interested in the strength of the flow induced by e0 and g0 as compared to the flow induced by g1. (We assume that e0 and g0 have similar magnitudes.) If Jnhydro is localized at a scale Γs, then for a source such as the one we have described, where e0 and g0 are non-vanishing at leading order, one expects Because one only trusts linearized hydro for R  ≫  Γs, our results correspond to scenario 1. To get scenario 2, one needs γ1  ≫  1.

The conclusion was based on dimensional reasoning and so should be treated with some caution. We can calculate a precise value for γ1, as well as more information about the structure of the source terms e0 and g0, by calculating the stress tensor at the first subleading order in k. That is, we expand and impose and at order O(1) to get δT(1)  mnhydro. These subleading contributions to the energy momentum tensor are currently available only for the N = 4 theory [\cite=Friess:2006fk]. Adapting the notation in [\cite=Friess:2006fk] to the current conventions, we find that This corresponds to

[formula]

where we have used Γs  =  1 / 3πT. From we read off These results agree with the expectation that Jnhydro has structure on the scale Γs, and it implies that Taking Γs  =  0.07  fm and R  =  7  fm to make a rough comparison with heavy ion collisions, one finds γ1  =  0.01.

It seems likely that γ1 will be be small for phenomenologically interesting values of R even for AdS/CFT constructions including scalars, unless perhaps the scalar lagrangian has some very special or extreme form. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see what form these subleading expressions take in, for example, the [formula] theory [\cite=Pilch:2000ue] [\cite=Buchel:2003ah] [\cite=Buchel:2007vy], or the casacading gauge theory [\cite=Klebanov:2000hb] [\cite=Gubser:2001ri] [\cite=Mahato:2007zm] [\cite=Aharony:2007vg]. It seems to us more likely that γ1 could be altered significantly by considering a different source from the heavy quark we have employed throughout.

Jet-splitting and the challenge of diffusion wakes

In this section we attempt to bridge between our results from AdS/CFT and the phenomenological literature on heavy ion collisions. In doing so we should bear in mind all the usual caveats to such comparisons. In particular: the AdS/CFT results apply in the limit of large N and large 't Hooft coupling g2YMN; the quark in our treatment is infinitely heavy and has constant velocity; and the holographic dual to QCD is not known.

In heavy ion collisions, a well studied experimental probe of the interaction of a hard parton with the medium is the relative azimuthal angle Δφ between two energetic hadrons emitted from the interaction region. Histograms of hadron pairs always show a peak at Δφ = 0, most likely meaning that the two hadrons were part of the same jet. In proton-proton collisions and sufficiently peripheral heavy ion collisions where the extent of the medium is small, another peak at Δφ  =  π arises, owing presumably to events where two hard partons are created with back-to-back momenta--at least, back-to-back in the azimuthal direction. See figure [\ref=azimuth].

Jet-broadening or jet-splitting refers to the change in shape of the peak at Δφ  =  π. Di-hadron histograms published by the PHENIX collaboration in [\cite=Adler:2005ee] show a definite double-peaked structure: a minimum at Δφ  =  π and peaks at Δφ  ≈  π  ±  1.2. On the other hand, the di-hadron histograms published by the STAR collaboration in [\cite=Adams:2005ph] do not exhibit a pronounced double-peaked structure and are discussed in that paper in terms of softening in pT, broadening in Δφ and rapidity, and thermalization. Momentum cuts were significantly different in these two studies: STAR's pseudo-rapidity acceptance, |η| < 1, is also significantly greater than PHENIX's, |η|  <  0.35. Subsequent experimental analyses, including [\cite=Ulery:2005cc] [\cite=Adare:2006nr] [\cite=Horner:2007gt] [\cite=Ulery:2007zb] [\cite=Jia:2007sf], support the conclusion that at least for intermediate momentum hadrons, similar to the PHENIX cuts shown in , splitting of the away side peak does occur.

A candidate explanation for jet-splitting is that a hard parton traveling through a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) loses energy in large part by producing a sonic boom [\cite=Casalderrey-Solana:2004qm] [\cite=Stoecker:2004qu]. The sonic boom would then propagate through the plasma until freeze-out converts it into an excess of hadrons emitted in roughly the direction of the Mach angle, relative to the direction of the original parton. There are theoretical alternatives (see for example [\cite=Ruppert:2005uz] [\cite=Koch:2005sx] [\cite=Polosa:2006hb] [\cite=Vitev:2005yg]), but our string theory results bear less directly upon them. In [\cite=Casalderrey-Solana:2004qm], two scenarios were presented for the distribution of energy into sound modes and diffusion modes. In section [\ref=HYDRO] we have shown that in scenario 1 the relative strength of the sonic boom and the diffusion wake is the same as in our string theory analysis. After Cooper-Frye hadronization on a surface of fixed time, it shows no jet-splitting due to the relatively strong diffusion wake. In scenario 2, only longitudinal modes are sourced by the energy momentum tensor so the diffusion wake is entirely suppressed and a jet-splitting effect is recovered after Cooper-Frye hadronization. Further work [\cite=CasalderreySolana:2006sq] showed that for scenario 2 to match to data, the energy loss per distance needs to be chosen quite large--perhaps unrealistically so. Another study [\cite=Chaudhuri:2005vc] included expansion of the plasma and used source terms similar to scenario 1. It also concluded that a minimum at δφ  =  π is hard to achieve. In [\cite=Renk:2005si] [\cite=Renk:2006mv], a model including Mach cone propagation through the QGP has been argued to fit experimental data provided the fraction of energy going into the sonic boom is 0.75 or more. But it is not yet clear to us how this fraction is related to the relative strength of the sonic boom and the diffusion wake as we compute it.

The robustness of the diffusion wake in the string theory construction we have explored favors scenario 1. It is therefore a concern that this scenario seems less likely to agree with data. It is natural for us to hope that a diffusion wake really is generated when a hard parton traverses a quark-gluon plasma, but that it is erased or disguised in the data. More realistic theoretical treatments should include expansion of the plasma, as in [\cite=Chaudhuri:2005vc] [\cite=Renk:2005si] [\cite=Renk:2006mv] and perhaps also a more sophisticated treatment of hadronization; as compared to the sonic boom, the diffusion wake is deeper inside the expanding medium, so it has more chance to broaden, soften, and thermalize before freeze-out. Some hints of this were observed in [\cite=Chaudhuri:2005vc]. There also issues of detector acceptance which may be relevant, see for example the discussion in [\cite=Renk:2006mv]. Finally, we should keep firmly in mind our starting assumption that the quark is very massive. If the trigger particle could be tagged as originating from a heavy quark, then the distribution of associated hadrons would be more directly related to our analysis. Studies cited thus far do not include flavor tagging; see however [\cite=Lin:2007rn].

In summary: We have argued that the strength of the diffusion wake relative to the drag force is universal in AdS/CFT constructions based on a trailing string in a background supported by arbitrary scalar matter. This universality is in some ways comparable to the universality of the η / s ratio [\cite=Buchel:2003tz] [\cite=Kovtun:2004de] [\cite=Buchel:2004di] (see also [\cite=Buchel:2007mf]): it arises because of a decoupling of certain metric perturbations from the scalar dynamics, and it may suffer corrections in inverse powers of N and g2YMN. Also, it is worth remembering that our slightly weaker result on the universality of dissipation through sound modes does not specify how well this dissipation is focused at the Mach angle. Phenomenologically, it may be challenging to accommodate as strong a diffusion wake as we predict.

Holographic renormalization

The prescription for calculating the expectation value of a gauge theory operator 〈OΦ〉 dual to a field Φ in the supergravity limit of string theory is to identify the generating function of 〈OΦ〉 with the supergravity partition function [\cite=Gubser:1998bc] [\cite=Witten:1998qj]. Sources for the operator 〈OΦ〉 in the gauge theory are identified with boundary values of Φ (modulo some issues with low dimension operators [\cite=Klebanov:1999tb].) In the saddle point approximation, calculating one point functions reduces to varying the supergravity action with respect to the boundary values of the fields Φ near the AdS boundary.

[formula]

Here g is defined through [formula], and g(0) is the leading O(r0) term in a series expansion of g. Similarly, φ(0) is the leading O(r4 - Δ) term (with Δ the dimension of OΦ) in a series expansion of Φ.

At this point the prescription [\eqref=E:OPhiVEV] is not well defined since generically [\eqref=E:OPhiVEV] will give divergent results. Simply ignoring these divergences may lead to wrong Ward identities. One prescription for systematically dealing with these singularities is holographic renormalization [\cite=deHaro:2000xn] [\cite=Bianchi:2001kw] (see [\cite=Skenderis:2002wp] for a review). This prescription seems to work well even for non asymptotically AdS backgrounds [\cite=Aharony:2005zr]. It comprises of adding a boundary action Sct to SSUGRA. Sct may be composed only of the boundary values of the field Φ, and is constructed so as to precisely cancel the r  →  0 divergences which appear in [formula].

In the current setup, we are interested in the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor [\cite=Balasubramanian:1999re],

[formula]

where TBYmn is the Brown York stress tensor, which is what we would obtain by varying the on-shell Gibbons Hawking term in the action and simply discarding the singularities. More precisely, we are interested in the contribution of the trailing string, or moving quark, to the energy momentum tensor to linear order in κ25, i.e.

[formula]

The purpose of this section is to show that δXmn is diagonal and to evaluate the off diagonal parts of 〈δTmn〉 in terms of the near boundary value of the metric fluctuations.

Expanding the various scalar fields in a power series in r, we find

[formula]

where ΔI is the dimension of the operator dual to φI. If ΔI is an integer then additional logarithmic terms will appear in the series expansion for φI. Fields dual to irrelevant operators have ΔI  >  4. In that case the power series expansion in r is divergent at the boundary and the sources φI  (0) should be taken to be infinitesimal, so that they vanish on-shell [\cite=Witten:1998qj] [\cite=deHaro:2000xn]. For clarity, we shall omit the index I, and reinsert it only when required. The coefficients φ(n) in [\eqref=E:expansionF] can be related to φ(0) by solving the equation of motion for φ order by order in r. The coefficients (n) are related to (0) in a similar manner. (0) and φ(0) are determined through the boundary conditions. For the case at hand the response of the field to the string is such that the leading near boundary contributions vanish. Using the same notation as in [\eqref=LinearizedFluctuations]

[formula]

we have δφ(0)  =  0. Also, in our construction the background value of the fields φ depend only on the radial coordinate, meaning that in the notation of [\eqref=E:LF2] φ(0) is a constant. A similar analysis follows for a near boundary expansion of the metric

[formula]

Consider now the boundary counterterm action Sct. As discussed earlier it must be composed of the near boundary metric [formula] and fields φ(ε), where ε is the radial coordinate which will be taken to zero at the end of the calculation. Writing the metric dependence explicitly, we find

[formula]

where the integrals are over a surface which is a distance r = ε from the asymptotically AdS boundary. In [\eqref=E:Sctexpansion] we have used

[formula]

and we've also rewritten any [formula] expressions as γmn∂nφI∂mLI.

We wish to evaluate the finite terms in

[formula]

where [formula] is the on-shell boundary action which gets contributions from the various scalar fields.

We start from the last expression in the parenthesis in [\eqref=E:dSctdG0]. Using [\eqref=E:Sctexpansion], the leading contributions to [formula] which come from the trailing string will look like

[formula]

The second term in [\eqref=E:dLctdG0] vanishes since it must involve two derivatives in a direction tangent to the radial AdS direction. One of these will always act on a background field φ(0) which depends only on the radial direction, giving ∂iφ(0)  =  0.

Consider the first term in [\eqref=E:dLctdG0]. LR and δLR are polynomials of the scalar fields with LR,δLR  ~  εn with n  ≥  0. (The inequality for n follows by considering [\eqref=E:expansionF]. If n < 0 then LR,δLR  ~  εn would imply a non vanishing source term for a non-normalizable operator.) So we can expand [formula] and [formula]. Similarly Rij  =  0 for i  ≠  j because the background metric g is independent of the xi directions and [formula] since the boundary conditions on the response of the metric to the string are that the metric vanishes close to the boundary. This brings us to the conclusion that δ(RijLR)  ~  ε4 so the first term in [\eqref=E:dLctdG0] will not contribute to the stress energy tensor through [\eqref=E:Sctexpansion] and [\eqref=E:dSctdG0].

Finally we consider contributions coming from [formula]. Expanding

[formula]

and Lct  +  Lb  =  L(0)Λ + L(0)b  +  O(ε2), we see that any finite non diagonal contributions of [formula] to 〈Tmn〉 can only come from [formula]. But such expressions will also contribute to a divergent O(ε- 4) term in [formula] which will not be compensated by the Gibbons Hawking term since it involves the scalar fields. Therefore such a contribution will not exist.

We are left with evaluating the Brown York stress tensor. In a general setting, this tensor is defined on a hypersurface Σ whose outward pointing normal is Nμ. (Outward pointing means pointing toward the conformal boundary.) The definition is where gΣmn is the induced metric on Σ and Kmn is its extrinsic curvature. This expression comes from varying the Gibbons Hawking term in terms of the boundary metric γΣmn. The indices m and n run from 0 to 3 (along Σ) while μ runs over all five dimensions of the asymptotically AdS spacetime, whose radius of curvature near the boundary is L. In general, but in axial gauge, when Σ is a surface at fixed r, one has the simpler expressions The metric of the boundary theory and the holographic stress tensor must be computed in a coordinated way, because both are affected by conformal transformations. A consistent prescription is For the ansatz , one finds [formula] and where we have used .
