Abstract

We prove that any (real or complex) analytic horizontally conformal submersion from a three-dimensional conformal manifold M3 to a two-dimensional conformal manifold N2 can be, locally, 'extended' to a unique harmonic morphism from the H(eaven)-space of M3 to N2.

Introduction

Harmonic morphisms are maps between Riemannian manifolds (or, more generally, Weyl spaces) which pull-back (local) harmonic functions to harmonic functions. By a basic result, harmonic morphisms are characterised as harmonic maps which are horizontally weakly conformal (see [\cite=BaiWoo2] , [\cite=LouPan] ). In [\cite=Woo-4d] (see [\cite=LouPan] ) it is proved that any (submersive) harmonic morphism φ with two-dimensional fibres from a four-dimensional Einstein manifold (M4,g) is twistorial, possibly with respect to the opposite orientation on M4. That is, after reversing, if necessary, the orientation on M4, the unique positive almost Hermitian structure J on (M4,g) with respect to which φ is holomorphic is integrable; we then say that φ is positive. Moreover, J is parallel along the fibres of φ . Thus if, further, (M4,g) is anti-self-dual then J determines a complex surface S in the twistor space of (M4,g) which, if J is nowhere Kähler, is foliated by the holomorphic distribution determined by the Levi-Civita connection of g . It follows that, then, φ is completely determined by S . This gives the twistorial construction of all positive harmonic morphisms with two-dimensional fibres from a four-dimensional Einstein anti-self-dual manifold with nonzero scalar curvature [\cite=Woo-4d] . In [\cite=LeB-Hspace] , it is proved that any analytic three-dimensional conformal manifold (N3,c) is the conformal infinity of a unique (up to homotheties) four-dimensional Einstein anti-self-dual manifold (M4,g) with nonzero scalar curvature; the fact that (N3,c) is the conformal infinity of (M4,g) means that [formula] is a manifold with boundary (equal to N3) on which c and g determine a conformal structure with respect to which g has a pole along N3. The constructed Einstein anti-self-dual manifold (M4,g) is called the H(eaven)-space of (M3,c) [\cite=LeB-Hspace] . The above mentioned two constructions raise the following questions. Given a positive harmonic morphism with two-dimensional fibres on the H-space of a three-dimensional analytic conformal manifold (N3,c) , can it be extended over N3 ? If so, is the resulting map horizontally conformal? Conversely, can any analytic horizontally conformal submersion, with one-dimensional fibres on (N3,c) be, locally, 'extended' to a harmonic morphism on its H-space? In this paper we answer in the affirmative to all of these questions, thus generalizing results of [\cite=BaiWoo-shearfree] in which the same conclusions are obtained for four-dimensional constant curvature Riemannian manifolds. In Section 1 we review a few facts on harmonic morphisms between Weyl spaces. In Section 2 we present the basic properties of the space of isotropic geodesics of a (three-dimensional) conformal manifold. Here, the emphasis is on the induced contact structure [\cite=LeB-Hspace] , [\cite=LeB-nullgeod] ; also, our presentation seems to be new and more natural. We end Section 2 by illustrating how this theory can be used to construct horizontally conformal submersions with one-dimensional fibres from the Euclidean space. This (Example [\ref=exm:PB] ; cf. [\cite=BaiWoo-shearfree] ) also provides examples for the main result of the paper (Theorem [\ref=thm:PB] ), proved in Section 3 . There, we also explain how other examples can be obtained by using a construction of [\cite=Cal-sds] .

Harmonic morphisms between Weyl spaces

This paper deals mainly with (real or complex) analytic manifolds and maps. Nevertheless, the results presented in this section also hold in the category of smooth manifolds. A conformal structure on a manifold M is a line subbundle c of [formula] which, on open sets of M, is generated by Riemannian metrics [\cite=LeB-nullgeod] ; then any such metric is a local representative of c . If c is a conformal structure on M then (M,c) is a conformal manifold. A conformal connection on (M,c) is a linear connection which preserves the sheaf of sections of c . A Weyl connection is a torsion free conformal connection. If D is a Weyl connection on (M,c) then (M,c,D) is a Weyl space. For more information on Weyl spaces see [\cite=Cal-sds] , where although the discussion is placed in the setting of smooth manifolds it can be easily extended to complex manifolds (see [\cite=LouPan] ). Whilst in the category of complex manifolds, we shall assume that all maps between conformal manifolds have nowhere degenerate fibres (see [\cite=LouPan] for a few facts on harmonic morphisms with degenerate fibres).

Let φ:(M,cM)  →  (N,cN) be a map between conformal manifolds. Then φ is horizontally weakly conformal if, outside the set where its differential is zero, φ is a Riemannian submersion with respect to suitable local representatives of cM and cN.

Next, we recall the definitions of harmonic maps and morphisms (see [\cite=LouPan] , cf. [\cite=BaiWoo2] ).

A map φ:(M,cM,DM)  →  (N,cN,DN) between Weyl spaces is harmonic if the trace, with respect to cM, of the covariant derivative of [formula] is zero. A harmonic morphism between Weyl spaces is a map which pulls-back (local) harmonic functions to harmonic functions.

The following result is basic for harmonic morphisms (see [\cite=LouPan] and its references, cf. [\cite=BaiWoo2] ).

A map between Weyl spaces is a harmonic morphism if and only if it is a harmonic map which is horizontally weakly conformal.

See [\cite=LouPan] , [\cite=LouPan-II] for more information on harmonic morphisms between Weyl spaces and [\cite=BaiWoo2] for harmonic morphisms in the setting of Riemannian manifolds; also, see [\cite=Gudbib] for an up to date list of papers on harmonic morphisms.

Spaces of isotropic geodesics

In this section, with the exception of Example [\ref=exm:PB] , all the manifolds and maps are assumed to be complex analytic. Let (M3,cM) be a three-dimensional (complex-)conformal manifold and let π:P  →  M be the bundle of isotropic directions tangent to (M3,cM) . Then P is a locally trivial bundle with typical fibre the conic [formula] . Let D be a Weyl connection, locally defined, on (M3,cM) . For any p∈P let [formula] be the horizontal lift, with respect to D , of p  ⊆  Tπ(p)M. Then [formula] is (the tangent bundle of) a foliation on P; moreover, [formula] does not depend of D . The quadruple [formula] is a twistorial structure on M [\cite=PanWoo-sd] (see [\cite=LouPan-II] for the definition of twistorial structures in the smooth category), its twistor space Z (that is, the leaf space of [formula]) is the space of isotropic geodesics [\cite=LeB-Hspace] , [\cite=LeB-nullgeod] of (M3,cM) . Furthermore, locally, τ is simple (that is, by passing, if necessary, to an open set of M there exists a, necessarily unique, complex structure on Z with respect to which the projection πZ:P  →  Z is a submersion with connected fibres and each of its fibres intersects the fibres of π at most once); then the fibres of π are mapped by πZ diffeomorphically onto the skies (see [\cite=LeB-Hspace] , [\cite=LeB-nullgeod] ) of (M3,cM) . From now on, in this section, we shall assume that τ is simple. Let [formula] be the distribution on P such that [formula] is the sum of [formula] and the horizontal lift, with respect to D , of [formula], for each p∈P. Then [formula] does not depend of D . Moreover, [formula] is projectable with respect to [formula]. To prove this, we place the discussion on the bundle E of conformal frames on (M3,cM) . Let p0 be a fixed isotropic direction on [formula], endowed with its canonical conformal structure, and let G be the subgroup of [formula] which preserves p0. Then P = E / G and let [formula] and [formula] be the preimages of [formula] and [formula], respectively, through the differential of the projection E  →  P. It is clear that [formula] is projectable with respect to [formula] if and only if [formula] is projectable with respect to [formula]. Furthermore, we can define [formula] and [formula], alternatively, as follows. Let ξ0 be a nonzero element of p0 and let B(ξ0) be the standard horizontal vector field corresponding to ξ0 ; that is, B(ξ0) is the vector field on E which, at each u∈E , is the horizontal lift of u(ξ0)∈TM, with respect to D . Then, by using the same notation for elements of [formula] and the corresponding fundamental vector fields on E , the distribution [formula] is generated by B(ξ0) and all [formula] , where [formula] is the Lie algebra of G . Similarly, [formula] is generated by all B(ξ) with [formula] and all [formula] . From Cartan's structural equations and [\cite=KoNo] it follows quickly that [formula] is projectable with respect to [formula] and, therefore, [formula] is projectable with respect to [formula]. Moreover, [\cite=KoNo] also implies that [formula] is nonintegrable; that is, nowhere integrable. Hence, also, the induced distribution [formula] on Z is nonintegrable. As dim Z = 3 , this is equivalent to the fact that [formula] is a contact distribution on Z .

1) The skies are tangent to the contact distribution [formula]. Moreover, at each point, [formula] is generated by the tangent spaces to the skies. 2) Any surface embedded in Z corresponds to a foliation by isotropic geodesics on some open set of M3.

All of the above can be quickly generalised to conformal manifolds of any dimension thus obtaining results of [\cite=LeB-nullgeod] . Next, we concentrate on features specific to dimension three.

Let [formula] be a foliation by isotropic geodesics on (M3,cM) . Then [formula] is integrable. Furthermore, if we denote by [formula] the embedded surface in Z corresponding to [formula] then the foliations induced by [formula], on the leaves of [formula], correspond to the curves determined by [formula] on [formula] .

The fact that [formula] is integrable follows quickly from the fact that D is torsion-free. Let p be the section of P corresponding to [formula]. Then [formula] induces a foliation on p(M) (whose leaves are mapped by π on the leaves of [formula]). As p(M) is an embedded submanifold of P foliated by the fibres of πZ , we have that [formula] is an embedded surface in Z . The last assertion follows from the fact that [formula] .

In Proposition [\ref=prop:nullgeodfolns] , the fact that [formula] is integrable follows also from the fact that [formula] is one-dimensional and, hence, integrable.

Recall [\cite=LeB-Hspace] that, under the identification of any sky with [formula], its normal bundle in Z is [formula] . Thus, by applying [\cite=Kod] we obtain that, locally, the skies are contained by a, locally complete, family of projective lines, parametrised by a four-dimensional manifold N4 which contains M3 as a hypersurface. Let [formula]. Furthermore, if we denote by cN the anti-self-dual conformal structure on N4 with respect to which Z is the twistor space (see [\cite=PanWoo-sd] ) of (N4,cN) then:  [formula] (M3,cM) is a totally umbilical hypersurface of (N4,cN) ; furthermore, under the identification of the twistor space of (N4,cN) with the space of isotropic geodesics on (M3,cM) any self-dual surface S on (N4,cN) corresponds to the isotropic geodesic [formula] on (M3,cM) [\cite=LeB-Hspace] .  [formula] [formula] determines an Einstein representative g of cN|H, unique up to homotheties, with nonzero scalar curvature [\cite=War-graviton].

The Einstein anti-self-dual manifold (H4,g) is called the H-space of (M3,cM) .

In [\cite=LeB-Hspace] it is, also, proved that g has a pole of order two along M3.

We end this section by illustrating how Remark [\ref=rem:contact_skies](2) and Example [\ref=exm:Hspace_hyperbolic] can be used to construct horizontally conformal submersions with one-dimensional fibres on the real Euclidean space.

Harmonic morphisms on H-spaces

In this section all the manifolds and maps are assumed to be complex analytic; by a real manifold/map we mean a manifold/map which is the (germ-unique) complexification of a real analytic manifold/map. We shall further assume that all the even dimensional conformal manifolds are oriented; that is, the bundle of conformal frames admits a reduction to the identity component of the group of conformal transformations. Next, we recall ( [\cite=PanWoo-sd] , see [\cite=LouPan] ) two examples of twistorial maps. See [\cite=LouPan-II] and [\cite=Pan-tm] for more information on twistorial maps.

Any real harmonic morphism with two-dimensional fibres from an oriented four-dimensional Einstein manifold (more generally, Einstein-Weyl space) is twistorial, possibly with respect to the opposite orientation on its domain [\cite=Woo-4d] (see [\cite=LouPan] ); we say that the harmonic morphism is positive if it is twistorial with respect to the given orientation on its domain and negative otherwise. Let (M3,cM) be a three-dimensional conformal manifold and let (H4,g) be its H-space. We shall use the same notations as in the previous section.

Any horizontally conformal submersion φ:(M3,cM)  →  (Q2,cQ) can be, locally, extended to a unique twistorial map [formula]. Moreover, [formula] is a harmonic morphism and any positive harmonic morphism with two-dimensional fibres on (H4,g) is obtained this way.

Let Z be the space of isotropic geodesics of (M3,cM) and let [formula] be the corresponding contact distribution. As φ is horizontally conformal it determines two foliations by horizontal isotropic geodesics on (M3,cM) . From Proposition [\ref=prop:nullgeodfolns] , it follows that φ corresponds to a pair of disjoint surfaces [formula] endowed with the one-dimensional foliations [formula], (j = 1,2). But Z is also the twistor space of (N4,cN) . Then [formula] and the endowed foliations determine a twistorial map [formula] (see [\cite=PanWoo-sd] ). Obviously, [formula] and so its uniqueness is a consequence of analyticity. Conversely, from [\cite=Woo-4d] (see [\cite=PanWoo-sd] ), it follows that any positive harmonic morphism η:(H4,g)  →  (Q2,cQ) determines a pair of foliations by self-dual surfaces on (N4,cN) . Then the leaves of these two foliations intersect M3 to determine a pair of foliations [formula] by isotropic geodesics on (M3,cM) . Let φ:(M3,cM)  →  (Q2,cQ) be such that [formula]. Then φ is horizontally conformal and [formula].

1) If we apply Theorem [\ref=thm:PB] to the particular case when (H4,g) has constant curvature then we obtain results of [\cite=BaiWoo-shearfree] . 2) With the same notations as above, if DM is an Einstein-Weyl connection on (M3,cM) with respect to which φ:(M3,DM)  →  (Q2,cQ) is a harmonic morphism then [formula] where ψ:N4  →  M3 is the retract [\cite=Hit-complexmfds] of [formula] corresponding to DM. It follows that ψ|H:(H4,g)  →  (M3,cM,DM) is a harmonic morphism [\cite=LouPan] .

Note that, φ and [formula] of Example [\ref=exm:PB] satisfy the assertions of Theorem [\ref=thm:PB] . Other examples can be built on the following construction.

By Remark [\ref=rem:PB](2) and with the same notations as in Example [\ref=exm:Cal-sds] , for any harmonic morphism φ:(M3,cM,DM)  →  (Q2,cQ) we have that [formula] is as in Theorem [\ref=thm:PB] . Such φ's can be obtained, for example, by using for (M3,cM,DM) the R. S. Ward and C. R. LeBrun construction (see [\cite=Cal-sds] and the references therein).
