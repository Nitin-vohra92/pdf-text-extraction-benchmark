Spectrum and polarization of coherent and incoherent radiation and the LPM effect in oriented single crystal

Introduction

The study of processes with participation of polarized electrons and photons permits to obtain the important physical information. Because of this reason the experiments with use of polarized particles are performed and are planning in many laboratories (CERN, Jefferson Nat Accl Fac, SLAC, BINP, etc). In this paper the polarization effects are considered in the frame of general theory developed by authors [\cite=BK1], which includes both the coherent and the incoherent mechanisms of radiation from high-energy electrons in an oriented single crystal. The influence of multiple scattering on the radiation process including polarization effects is analyzed. The study of radiation in oriented crystals is continuing and new experiments are performed recently see [\cite=KMU], [\cite=BKi].

The general expression for the energy loss of the longitudinally polarized electron in oriented crystal was found in [\cite=BK] (see Eq.(2.7))

[formula]

where dEξ  =  ωdwξ, dwξ is the probability of radiation, see e.g. Eq.(4.2) in [\cite=BKS], ω and ε are the photon and electron energy, α = e2 = 1 / 137, the vector [formula] is the photon momentum, [formula], ξ  =  λζ, ~ λ  =    ±  1 is the helicity of emitted photon, ζ  =    ±  1 is the helicity of the initial electron, F(,ϑ0) is the distribution function of electron in the transverse phase space depending on the angle of incidence ϑ0 of the electron on crystal, 1  =  (t1) is the electron velocity (see [\cite=BKS], Sec.16.2).

The degree of the circular polarization of radiation is defined by Stoke's parameter ξ2:

[formula]

where the quantity [formula] defines the longitudinal polarization of the initial electrons, dE+ and dE- is the energy loss for ξ=+1 and ξ=-1 correspondingly.

It should be noted that a few different spin correlations are known in an external field. But after averaging over directions of crystal field only the considered here longitudinal polarization survives.

In [\cite=BK] the polarization effects in the coherent radiation which dominates at high electron energies (ε  ≫  1 GeV for main axes of heavy elements, e.g. tungsten crystal) was studied. At intermediate energies the incoherent radiation contributes essentially and the contributions of both mechanisms should be taken into account. Recently authors developed the method which permits indivisible consideration of both the coherent and the incoherent mechanisms of photon emission in oriented crystals [\cite=BK1].

Basing on Eqs.(18) and (19) of [\cite=BK1] (see also Eqs. (7.89) and (7.90) in [\cite=BKS]) and using Eq.([\ref=1]) one can obtain the general expression for the intensity of radiation from longitudinally polarized electrons which includes the coherent and incoherent contributions and the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect:

[formula]

where

[formula]

The intensity for unpolarized electrons dI0(ε,y) was obtained in [\cite=BK1], the polarization term dI1(ε,y) is found here.

The situation is considered when the electron angle of incidence ϑ0 (the angle between electron momentum p and the axis (or plane)) is small ϑ0  ≪  V0 / m. The axis potential (see Eq.(9.13) in [\cite=BKS]) is taken in the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here ϱ is the distance from axis, u1 is the amplitude of thermal vibration, d is the mean distance between atoms forming the axis, as is the effective screening radius of the potential. The parameters in Eq.([\ref=4]) were determined by means of fitting procedure.

The local value of parameter χ(x) which determines the radiation probability in the field Eq.([\ref=4]) is

[formula]

For an axial orientation of crystal the ratio of the atom density n(ϱ) in the vicinity of an axis to the mean atom density na is (see [\cite=BK1])

[formula]

The functions and values in Eqs.([\ref=2]) and ([\ref=3]) are

[formula]

where the function g(x) determines the effective logarithm using the interpolation procedure:L = L0g(x), see Eq.(14) in [\cite=BK1], Dsc = 2,3008 is the constant entering in the radiation spectrum at χ / u  ≫  1, see Eq.(7.107) in [\cite=BKS],  Ei(z) is the integral exponential function, f(ξ) is the Coulomb correction.

It follows from Eqs.([\ref=1a]) and ([\ref=2]) that the circular polarization of radiation is

[formula]

The spectral distribution of radiation

The expression for dIξ Eq.([\ref=2]) includes both the coherent and incoherent contributions as well as the influence of the multiple scattering (the LPM effect) on the photon emission process.

The probability of the coherent radiation dIcoh0(ε,y) is the first term (ν20 = 0) of the decomposition of Eq.([\ref=2]) over ν20. This probability is contained in Eq.(17.7) of [\cite=BKS]. The polarization term in the probability of the coherent radiation dIcoh1(ε,y) is the first term of the decomposition of dI1 in Eq.([\ref=2]) over ν20. The expression dIcoh0  +  ξdIcoh1 coincides with the term containing R0(λ) in Eq.(3.5) of [\cite=BK].

The intensity of the incoherent radiation dIinc0(ε,y) is the second term ([formula]) of the mentioned decomposition of dI(ε,y) [\cite=BK1]. The expression for dIinc0(ε,y) follows also from Eq.(21.21) in [\cite=BKS]). The polarization term dIinc1(ε,y) is correspondingly the second term ([formula]) of decomposition of dI1(ε,y):

[formula]

here χ  =  χ(x), the notations is given in Eqs.([\ref=5]), ([\ref=6]) and ([\ref=7]), dJinc0,1(χ) can be written as

[formula]

the functions f1(z) and f2(z) are defined in the just mentioned equation in [\cite=BKS]:

[formula]

here Υ(z) is the Hardy function:

[formula]

For intermediate energies, where both the coherent and the incoherent contributions to the total intensity of radiation are essential, the spectral distribution of intensity dI0(ε,y) is shown in Fig.1. The calculation was done for axis < 111 >  of tungsten at low temperature T=100 K (parameters of crystal are given Table 1). These spectra describe radiation in thin targets when one can neglect the energy loss of projectile. It is seen that the phenomena under consideration become apparent at relatively low energy. For ε = 0.3 GeV, dIcoh0≃dIinc0 at y≃0.1 ~ (ω≃60 ~ MeV) while for lower photon energy the coherent contribution dominates and for higher photon energy the incoherent contribution dominates. For ε = 1 GeV, dIcoh0≃dIinc0 at y≃0.28 ~ (ω≃280 ~ MeV) and for ε = 3 GeV, dIcoh0≃dIinc0 at y≃0.54 ~ (ω≃1.6 ~ GeV). All spectrum curves have very steep (exponential) right slope the location of which is defined by the electron energy.

The next terms of decomposition of the intensity dI0(ε,y) over ν20 describe the influence of multiple scattering on the radiation process, the LPM effect. The different contributions to that part of the spectrum, where the coherent and the incoherent contributions are comparable, are shown in Fig.2. The difference shown by curve 5 arises due to the LPM effect. We define the contribution of the LPM effect into spectral distribution, by analogy with [\cite=BK1], as

[formula]

The function Δs(y) is shown in Fig.3. The curve 1 for ε = 0.3 ~  GeV reaches the maximum 6.64 % at y=0.18, the curve 2 for ε = 1 ~  GeV reaches the maximum 6.87 % at y=0.44 and the curve 3 for ε = 3 ~  GeV reaches the maximum 7.32 % at y=0.7.

At room temperature (T=293 K) for axis < 111 >  in tungsten for the electron energy ε = 10 ~  GeV the different contributions to that part of the spectrum where the coherent and the incoherent contributions are comparable are shown in Fig.4. In this case the maximum of the function Δs(y)≃6.03 % is reached at y=0.82.

All the curves in Fig.2 have nearly the same height of the maximum and the position of the maximum is defined roughly by the expression [formula]. Such scaling in terms of u is the consequence of the following representation of the spectral inverse radiation length (the intensity spectrum Eq.([\ref=2]))

[formula]

In the high energy limit ε  ≫  ε0 the maximum of the LPM effect is situated at the very end of the spectrum. In this limit r2≃1 - O(ε0  /  ε) and r3≃O(ε0  /  ε) and the scaling (dependence on the combination ε / u only) of each of the two R2,3 terms gets over into scaling of the whole expression for the spectral inverse radiation length.

In the maximum of the LPM effect the coherent contribution into spectral radiation intensity is relatively small: less than 10%. Therefore the right slope of curves in Fig.3 is described by formulas of the LPM effect in a medium (incoherent radiation) with corrections due to action of the crystal field. Far of the maximum at u  ≫  ε  /  ε0 one has Rcoh2,3 = 0 and the terms [formula] in the decomposition of the functions R2,3 (which includes the crystal field corrections) have the form

[formula]

Here the terms independent on field coincide with corresponding terms in Eq.(3.6) in [\cite=BK3], the corrections depending on crystal field are calculated in this paper. At the left slope of the curves in Fig.3 the coherent contribution dominates (see Fig.1), the relative contribution of incoherent radiation diminishes and the LPM effect is only its small part.

Degree of the circular polarization of radiation Eq.([\ref=8]) is shown in Fig.5. The curves for energies ε = 0.3,1,3 ~ GeV coincide with each other inside thickness of line. For any mechanism of radiation [formula] for y  ≪  1 (see Eq.(2.9)) in [\cite=BK] and ξ2  →  1 for y  →  1 as a consequence of the helicity transfer from an electron to photon.

The next terms of decomposition of the intensity dI1(ε,y) over ν20 describe the influence of multiple scattering on the polarization part of the spectral intensity of radiation. We define the contribution of this effect into the polarization part as

[formula]

The function Δs1(y) for ε = 0.3 ~  GeV reaches the maximum 6.78 % at y=0.18, for ε = 1 ~  GeV reaches the maximum 7.09 % at y=0.44 and for ε = 3 ~  GeV reaches the maximum 7.43 % at y=0.7. It is seen that the maximum positions are situated at the same photon energy as in Δs(y) (see Fig.3) and their values are very close to these values in the unpolarized part. All this means that the multiple scattering is affecting similarly on the unpolarized spectrum described by dI0(ε,y) and the polarization term described by dI1(ε,y).

The influence of the multiple scattering on the photon polarization degree may be also characterized by

[formula]

Since value Δs1 is very close to Δs the value of Δsξ is much smaller than both Δs and Δs1.

Effect for the total intensity of radiation

Now we turn to analysis of the polarization effects for the total intensities of radiation

[formula]

The integral degree of the circular polarization of the radiation intensity in a crystal is given by the ratio ξT2 = I1(ε) / I0(ε).

In [\cite=BK1] it was shown that the total intensity I(ε) contains both the coherent and incoherent contributions as well as the influence of the multiple scattering (the LPM effect) on the process under consideration. The same is true for the polarization term I1(ε). The intensity of coherent radiation [formula] is the first term (ν20 = 0) of the decomposition of I(ε) over ν20. Its explicit representation is given by Eqs.(25) and (26) in [\cite=BK1]. The coherent polarization term Icoh1(ε) is the first term (ν20 = 0) of the decomposition of I1(ε) over ν20. Both can be written in the form

[formula]

where Jcoh0(χ) is the radiation intensity and Jcoh1(χ) is the contribution of the circular polarization of radiation in external field (see Eqs.(4.50), (4.51) and (4.84) in [\cite=BKS]). The representation ([\ref=10]) is convenient both for the analytical and numerical calculation. The degree of circular polarization of the coherent radiation in a crystal we define by the ratio ξcoh2 = Icoh1 / Icoh0.

In [\cite=BK1] the new representation of the function Jinc0(χ) was obtained, which is suitable for both analytical and numerical calculation. The same procedure can be applied to Jinc1(χ). As a result we get

[formula]

where

[formula]

The integral degree of circular polarization of the incoherent radiation in a crystal we define by the ratio ξinc2 = Iinc1 / Iinc0.

The integral degree of circular polarization in the tungsten crystal (axis < 111 > , the temperatures T=100 K) ξT2 = I1(ε) / I(ε) Eq.([\ref=9]) is shown in Fig.6 (the curve T), as well as the coherent degree ξcoh2 = Icoh1 / Icoh0 Eq.([\ref=10]) (the curve 1) and the incoherent degree ξinc2 = Iinc1 / Iinc0 Eq.([\ref=16]) (the curve 2) as a function of incident electron energy ε. In low energy region (ε  ≤  1 GeV the contribution of incoherent mechanism dominates (let us remind that the intensities of the incoherent and coherent radiation become equal at ε≃0.7 GeV). At higher energies the intensity Icoh0(ε) dominates while the intensity Iinc0(ε) decreases monotonically [\cite=BK1]. Correspondingly the curve ξcoh2 tends to the curve ξT2. At extremely high energy ε  >  106 GeV ξcoh2 tends to the external field limit: ξcoh2=11/16 (see Eq.(4.88) in [\cite=BKS]).

The next terms of decomposition of the total intensity I(ε) over ν20 describe the LPM effect in the radiation process. The contribution of the LPM effect in the total intensity of radiation I Eq.([\ref=9]) is defined in [\cite=BK1] as ILPM = I0  -  Icoh0 - Iinc0. The relative contribution (negative since the LPM effect suppresses the radiation process) Δ =  - ILPM / I0 in the maximum is of the order of percent (see Fig.3 in [\cite=BK1]). Similarly we define the relative influence of multiple scattering on the photon integral circular polarization as

[formula]

The function of Δ1(ε) (per cent) is shown in Fig.7, it attains the maximum Δ1≃2.0% at ε≃1.4 GeV, while Δξ(ε) attains the maximum Δξ≃1.4% at ε≃1.8 GeV and Δ(ε)≃0.9% at ε≃0.3 GeV [\cite=BK1]. One can see that maxima of corresponding functions are slightly shifted with respect each other and the highest maximum has Δ1. From the other side, the behavior of all functions Δ, Δ1 and Δξ are quite similar: just as in the total intensity of radiation the suppression of integral polarization due to the multiple scattering is concentrated in the interval of moderate energies ε  <  10 ~  GeV and scale of effect is of the order of percent.

Conclusion

In this paper the spectrum of radiation from an electron of intermediate energy (a few GeV for heavy elements) moving in oriented crystal is calculated for the first time. The interplay of the coherent and the incoherent parts is essential for formation of the spectrum. Just in this situation the effects of multiple scattering of projectile appear. The same is true also for depending on polarization part of the spectral intensity.

In an oriented crystal at motion of an electron near the chain of atoms (the axis) the atom density on the trajectory is much higher than in an amorphous medium. As a result, the parameter characterizing the influence of multiple scattering on the radiation process in a medium in absence of an external field (ν20  ~  ε  /  ε0) becomes of the order of unity at enough low energy (values of ε0 for tungsten and germanium are given in Table 1). From the other side, due to high density of atoms at the trajectory near axis, the strong electric field of axis acts on the electron. This action diminishes the radiation formation length and expands the characteristic angles of photon emission and hence weakens the influence of multiple scattering on the radiation process. So, one has to use the general expression for the radiation intensity which takes into account both the crystal effective field (the coherent mechanism) and the multiple scattering (the incoherent mechanism) for study of the characteristics of radiation. Such expression for the unpolarized case dI0(ε,y) was obtained in [\cite=BK1] and the polarization term dI1(ε,y) derived here (see Eq.([\ref=2])). The two first terms of decomposition of dIξ(ε,y) over the parameter ν20 define the coherent and incoherent radiation. It should be noted that in the incoherent contribution the influence of crystalline field is taken into account. Other terms of the decomposition represent influence of the crystalline field on the multiple scattering (on the LPM effect).

Since in an amorphous medium the LPM effect for the whole spectrum can be observed (for heavy elements) only in TeV energy range (see e.g. [\cite=BK2]) the possibility to study the influence of multiple scattering on radiation process in GeV energy range is evidently of great interest.

In the present paper the detailed analysis of the spectral and the polarization properties of radiation is performed. The influence of different mechanisms of photon emission on general picture of event is elucidated. At high energy ε  ≫  ε0 the influence of the multiple scattering on the radiation intensity is suppressed strongly (the coherent contribution dominates) and only in the very end of the spectrum at u  ≥  ε  /  ε0  ≫  1 ~ (1 - ω  /  ε  ≤  ε0  /  ε  ≪  1) the incoherent radiation becomes essential. In this part of the spectrum the nearly complete (with accuracy ~  (ε0  /  ε)2) helicity transfer from electron to photon occurs and the scaling defined by Eq.([\ref=a15]) takes place. For any energy ε the maximum value of the LPM effect is around 7 % is situated at um  ~  3ε  /  ε0 ~ (ωm  =  εum / 1 + um). For ω  =  ωm the incoherent contribution dominates, its contribution is one order of magnitude higher than the coherent one. So at ε  ≫  ε0 the maximum of the LPM effect is situated in very end of the spectrum where the mentioned scaling holds. It should be noted the very right end of spectrum is described by the Bethe-Maximon formulae with independent on the electron energy crystal corrections (compare e.g. with Eq.(8) in [\cite=BK1]). For illustration of the discussed effect we considered the low energy ε  ≤  ε0, where both the coherent and incoherent contributions are essential, while the mentioned scaling is only approximate one. This energy region is suitable for experimental study.

The polarization effects in radiation for the intermediate energy is analyzed for the first time. It is shown that the influence of multiple scattering on the depending on polarization part of intensity spectrum dI1(ε,y) is very close to the LPM effect in the unpolarized part dI0(ε,y).
