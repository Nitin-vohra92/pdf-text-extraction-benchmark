Formation of Moving Magnetic Features and Penumbral Magnetic Fields with Hinode/SOT

Introduction

A lot of small magnetic features moving outward are observed in moat regions surrounding mature sunspots. Such magnetic features called moving magnetic features (MMFs, [\cite=Harvey1973]) have been studied for about 40 years from the discovery by [\citet=Sheeley1969], but their formation process and magnetic field structure are still open issues due to a difficulty of tracking the evolution of such tiny magnetic features using vector magnetograms with high spatial resolution.

The relationship between MMFs and penumbral fields is important to understand the formation of MMFs and the decaying process of sunspots. The penumbral outer boundary has at least two magnetic components (horizontal fields and relatively vertical fields) called uncombed structure ([\cite=Solanki1993]), and Evershed flows are observed in the horizontal component of the penumbra([\cite=Degenhardt1991] [\cite=Title1993] [\cite=Lites1993] [\cite=Rimmele1995] [\cite=Stanchfield1997] [\cite=Westendorp2001a] [\cite=Westendorp2001b] [\cite=Mathew2003] [\cite=Bellot2003] [\cite=Bellot2004] [\cite=Ichimoto2007a]). Some authors have suggested that such Evershed flows drive outward motions of MMFs ([\cite=Ryutova1998] [\cite=Martinez2002] [\cite=Thomas2002] [\cite=Schlichenmaier2002] [\cite=Zhang2003]). [\citet=Sainz2005] observed that several bipolar MMFs crossed the penumbral outer boundary to enter the moat region along penumbral horizontal fields. [\citet=Cabrera2006] discovered that at least some MMFs were the continuation of penumbral Evershed flows into the moat region. [\citet=Kubo2007] found MMFs had significant magnetic correspondence with penumbral uncombed structure from observation of vector magnetic fields with the Advanced Stokes Polarimeter ([\cite=Elmore1992]): MMFs having horizontal fields with both polarities are located on the line extrapolated from the horizontal component, while MMFs having relatively vertical fields with polarity same as the sunspot are located on the line extrapolated from the vertical component (spine). Unipolar MMFs with the same polarity as the sunspot are less studied so far, but they would be more important in terms of the sunspot decay.

In this study, we investigate temporal change of magnetic field vector for MMFs with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT, [\cite=Tsuneta2007] [\cite=Suematsu2007] [\cite=Ichimoto2007b] [\cite=Shimizu2007a]) aboard Hinode ([\cite=Kosugi2007]). The Hinode/SOT provides us the time series of vector magnetic fields with the finest resolution (0".3) ever achieved in the uniform data quality.

Observation and Data Analysis

The SOT continuously observed a sunspot in an active region NOAA 10930 during 2007 January 4 to 12 (Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_Gband]). We used a data set with the Spectro-Polarimeter (SP) of the SOT from 21:57:03 to 22:55:00 in 2007 January 4 when the sunspot was located near the disk center (S04, E11). The SOT/SP repeatedly scanned the same region with a cadence of 128 seconds. The slit scanning step was 0arcsec .16, the number of steps in 1 scan is 24 (3arcsec .8), and integration time for one slit position was about 4.8 s. The field of view along the slit was 81arcsec  with the pixel sampling of 0arcsec .16. The SOT/SP simultaneously measured the full Stokes profiles (I, Q, U, V) of the Fe I lines at 630.15 and 630.25 nm with the sampling of 21.6 mÅ.

Vector magnetic fields were derived from the calibrated Stokes profiles on the assumption of Milne-Eddington atmospheres ([\cite=Yokoyama2007]). We examined field strength([formula]), inclination angle(γ) with respect to the line of sight direction, filling factor(f), and Doppler velocity (vlos) in this paper. We show vector magnetic fields by longitudinal field strength ([formula]) and transverse field strength ([formula]). The reference of the Doppler velocities was the line center position of Fe I 6302.5Å profiles averaged over the quiet area within the SP map.

Results

We focus on temporal change of magnetic and velocity fields while MMFs are formed around the outer edge of the penumbra. Based on the result of [\citet=Kubo2007], we investigate evolution of MMFs located on the lines extrapolated from the vertical and horizontal components of the penumbra separately.

MMF detached from the penumbral spine

The penumbral spine is a radial filamentary structure with more vertical magnetic fields than the surroundings ([\cite=Lites1993]), as shown by the black arrow in Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_vmmf] (b). We find that the penumbral spine branches off at their outer edge (two green arrows in the first panel of Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_vmmf] (b)). The right branch of the spine is connected to a large magnetic feature with vertical fields in the first frame and this large magnetic feature also branches off at its outer edge. Then, this large magnetic feature is detached from the penumbral spine in the later frames. We confirmed that the detached magnetic feature moved through the moat region as the MMF after the SP observation using longitudinal magnetograms with the Narrowband Filter Imager (NFI) of the SOT. There is no magnetic feature connected to the left branch of the spine in the first frame. The left branch elongates and a tiny magnetic feature (the green arrow at 22:41 frame in Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_vmmf] (b)) subsequently appears at the outer edge of the elongated branch. Such tiny magnetic feature is also formed for the right branch immediately after the large magnetic feature is detached (the green arrow in the last frame of Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_vmmf] (b)).

We find that the branch of penumbral spine is formed along the edge of bright features in the penumbra (the horizontal arrow in Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_vmmf] (a)). The bright features are located around the penumbral spine, but the penumbral spine itself is not bright. Such bright features gradually connect to the granular cells outside the penumbra, and then dark penumbral area between them completely disappears. Another large bright feature (the vertical arrow in Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_vmmf] (a) at 22:15) appears at the right side of the right branch while the large magnetic feature with more vertical fields is separating from the spine. The bright features in the penumbra have upward motions and weaker field strength for both longitudinal and transverse components in comparison with the surrounding penumbral fields. These properties are similar to granular cells outside the penumbra. The difference in magnetic and velocity fields from the surrounding penumbra is less clear for the bright features in the inner penumbra.

We can see a lot of velocity features other than upward motions of the bright features, but there is no systematic flow related with the formation of penumbral spine and MMFs detached from the spine.

MMFs located on the lines extrapolated from the horizontal component of the penumbra

Only MMFs with negative polarity, which is polarity opposite to the sunspot, are described here in detail because they are clearly identified from their surroundings. We discover that two MMFs with polarity opposite to the sunspot appear at the outer edge of horizontal fields extending from the penumbra, and move outward with the extending horizontal fields. The areas with stronger transverse field are extended to the moat region from the penumbra, as shown by the red and green arrows in Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_hmmf] (c). The outer edge of extending horizontal fields clearly correspond to positions of the two MMFs with negative polarity. The fuzzy and elongated MMF with positive polarity is observed inside the extending horizontal fields (the black arrow in Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_hmmf] (b)). These horizontal fields extending from the penumbra have been observed around the outer boundary of the penumbra in other data sets.

Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_hmmf] (b) and (d) show that the negative polarity MMFs have large redshifts. This result has been already mentioned in previous works ([\cite=Westendorp2001a], [\cite=Cabrera2006]). One example of evolution in Stokes profiles is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:hmmf_profile2]. We find that the shift of linear polarization signals (Q and U) profiles are much different from that of circular polarization (V): a major component of the linear polarization has a blueshift of about -1 km/s, while a major component of the circular polarization has a redshift of about +5 km/s when the negative MMF appears. Note that the large downward component is seen not only Stokes V profile but also in Stokes Q and U profiles: the Stokes Q and U have an extended wing that reaches the range of 5-  10 km/s. The major component of the linear polarization does not significantly change with time, while the redshifted circular polarization decreases with time. The duration of the large redshift is more than 10 minutes for the two cases in Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_hmmf], and [\citet=Shimizu2007b] shows a typical duration of such large redshift around the penumbrae is 5-  20 minutes.

The redshifts larger than sonic velocity (~   7 km/s) in the photosphere are detected for some of the MMFs with negative polarity in this study, as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:hmmf_profile1]. Zero-cross position of Stokes V profile is estimated to be about +9 km/s. In this case, significant linear polarization signals(Q and U) are not observed, but linear polarization is often observed in the MMFs with negative polarity as well as the circular polarization, as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:hmmf_profile2].

Discussion

Our observational result of the MMF detached from the penumbral spine shows that the branching and elongating of the spine are the basic process of the formation of the vertical MMF. Such vertical MMFs can carry away sufficient magnetic flux causing the loss of the sunspot magnetic fields ([\cite=Kubo2007]). Therefore, we suggest that granules appeared in the outer penumbra remove the vertical MMF from the penumbra and such granules are responsible for the decay of the sunspot (Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_model] (a)). We believe that the observed MMF is a representative case of the vertical MMFs with polarity same as the sunspot, but the branches of the penumbral spines and the granules in the outer penumbra are not observed for all the spines. Many small spines themselves seem to be elongating rather than branching. Whether the granules appear in the outer penumbra may depend on the size and amount of field-free gas under the photospheric surface. It is necessary to confirm the nature of the observed MMF is common to other vertical MMFs.

The fact that the MMFs with polarity opposite to the sunspot are located at the outer edge of horizontal fields extending from the penumbra is an evidence that such MMFs are continuation of the penumbral fields. This result supports the idea that such MMFs and the extending horizontal fields have the shape of a sea serpent ([\cite=Harvey1973] [\cite=Schlichenmaier2002]). The MMFs with both polarities located at the outer edge and the inside of the extending horizontal fields are intersections with the photospheric surface (formation layer of Fe I lines). The extending horizontal fields correspond to diffuse and ubiquitous moving moat fields in previous observations ([\cite=Sainz2005], [\cite=Kubo2007]). The SOT, for the first time, clearly resolves the diffuse structure in the moat region observed with lower spatial resolution in the past and reveals the moving moat fields extending from the penumbra are dynamical phenomena.

The complicated Stokes profiles for the MMFs with opposite polarities to that of the sunspot are reported in [\citet=Cabrera2006], and the complication of profiles seems to increase in the SOT data due to the resolution of magnetic fields with large velocity from ambient fields without a motion. The assumption of Milne-Eddington atmosphere is too simple for quantitative discussion on the MMFs having the Stokes V profile with more than two lobes. However, the MMFs with polarity opposite to the sunspot apparently have the larger circular polarization signal than the linear polarization in the red wing. This means that such MMFs have more vertical than the horizontal fields extending from the penumbra and large downward motion in the deep layer of photosphere. The extending horizontal fields drastically change at the patchy area of MMFs with polarity opposite to the sunspot (Figure [\ref=fig:mmf_model] (b)).
