Helical geometry of liquid crystals (LC) [\cite=1] has been proved very useful in the study of material science through the investigation of the so-called topological defects , disclinations linked in general to curvature and dislocations connected with torsion of three-dimensional space. More recently R. Kamien [\cite=2] has recalled the fact that curved crystals in materials behave geometrically as the curved spacetime of Einstein general relativity , which keeps bound the stars galaxies and the universe through gravitational force. Molecular attractive forces in biology and physics on the microscopic level would play the role of the gravitation. One of the main useful applications of these helical geometries is on the investigation of large macromolecules such as the double helix structure of DNA [\cite=3]. The main ingredient in the investigation of curved liquid crystals is the so-called torsion of the crystal structure, as shown recently by David Nelson and his Harvard group [\cite=4]. In 1998, Normann Watts and his group [\cite=5] have shown that LC can be useful in the experimental detection of the helical geometry of the HIV-1 Rev filaments. In their experiment the LC used keeps its integrity or stability as a fundamental step in the experiment. This allows us to investigate recently the Lagrangean or geometrical stability of curved and torsioned (or twisted) LC [\cite=6] which by computed the geodesic deviation of particles around the liquid crystals, which could be the moving of HIV molecules, diverge when the sectional curvature is negative, which indicates instability while the stability is connected to the positiveness of curvature. This simple mathematical technique applied to LC allows us to stablished the integrity or not of the LC used to test HIV viruses structure. It is not difficulty to show from the geometrical viewpoint that the stability or integrity of LC depends upon the pitch of the helix of double twisted blue phases of the crystals. This type of scientific activity may bind together several specialists of different areas of science, such as solid state physicists, soft matter condensed matter physicists, DNA and molecular biology and chemical engineers and biochemists. Another type of the application of these stability Lagrange investigations in on the plasma astrophysics where the solar filaments [\cite=7] undergo the same helical geometry that seems to be unfolded now in the realm of previously hidden HIV-1 retrovirusus investigation.
