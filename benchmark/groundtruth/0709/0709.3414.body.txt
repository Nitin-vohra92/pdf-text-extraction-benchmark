A normal distribution for the disturbance term in regression theory

Consider the regression equation The assumptions about the disturbance term ui are summarized as follows:

[formula]

No assumption is made regarding the distribution of the disturbance term ui. We wish to show that for large n the term ui follows the normal distribution N(O,σ2) with mean 0 and variant σ2.

We proceed as follows: let

[formula]

Let Then both the random variables X and Y approach the N(0,1) distribution for large n. By the Central Limit Theorem: for large n. The joint density fXY(x,y) is completely determined if we can calculate the correlation ρXY between X and Y. Thus we have: since σX  =  σY  =  1

[formula]

Thus the joint density fXY of X and Y is the bivariate normal density function: with σx = 1, σy = 1, μx = 0, μy = 0, and [formula] is for large n.

In order to find the density of ui for large n we consider the transformation (see [\cite=mood74]):

[formula]

Let the above transformation be a one-to-one transformation of the xy plane onto the uv plane with inverse transformation given by:

[formula]

The Jacobian of the above transformation is: We note in passing that the partial derivatives ∂x / ∂ui, ∂x / ∂u, ∂y / ∂ui, and ∂y / ∂u are all continuous functions of ui and u as they are constant.

We are interested in the absolute value of the Jacobian above: Then the joint density of ui and v is

[formula]

Thus when v is large.

From our study of the bivariate normal random variable u with density the integral above is unity i.e.: So that the density of ui alone is given by with u a normal distribution mean 0 variance σ2.

This is what we set out to prove when n is large.

Q.E.D.

Note

We observe that ui and v are independent as their joint density factors out as a product of ui and v alone. This is expected since ui and are clearly independent.
