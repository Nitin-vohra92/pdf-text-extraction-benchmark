Introduction

In many GUT models, the masses of charginos tend to be near the lower edge of the superpartner spectrum, and they can be pair-produced at a first-phase ILC with c.m. energy of [formula]. The precise measurement of their parameters (masses, mixings, and couplings) is a key for uncovering the fundamental properties of the MSSM [\cite=Aguilar-Saavedra:2005pw]. Regarding the experimental precision at the ILC, off-shell kinematics for the signal process, the reducible and irreducible backgrounds [\cite=Hagiwara:2005wg], and NLO corrections need to be included. We here present the inclusion of NLO chargino production where corrections can be in the percent regime.

Chargino production at LO and NLO

The total fixed-order NLO cross section is given by

[formula]

where s is the cm energy, me the electron mass, and Δ  Eγ the soft photon energy cut dividing the photon phase space. The 'virtual' contribution [formula] is the interference of the one-loop corrections [\cite=Fritzsche:2004nf] with the Born term. The collinear and infrared singularities are regulated by me and the photon mass λ, respectively. The dependence on λ is eliminated by adding the soft real photon contribution σs    =    fsoft  σBorn(s) with a universal soft factor [formula] [\cite=Denner:1991kt]. We break the 'hard' contribution σ2  →  3(s,ΔEγ,m2e), i.e., the real-radiation process e-e+  →  -i+jγ, into a collinear and a non-collinear part, separated at a photon acollinearity angle Δθγ relative to the incoming electron or positron. The collinear part is approximated by convoluting the Born cross section with a structure function [formula] [\cite=Bohm:1993qx]. The non-collinear part is generated explicitely.

The total fixed order cross section is implemented in the multi-purpose event generator O'Mega/WHIZARD [\cite=Moretti:2001zz] [\cite=Kilian:2007gr] using a 'user-defined' structure function and an effective matrix element [formula] which contains the Born part, the soft-photon factor and the Born-1 loop interference term. In the soft-photon region this approach runs into the problem of negative event weights [\cite=Kleiss:1989de]: for some values of θ, the 2  →  2 part of the NLO-corrected squared matrix element is positive definite by itself only if ΔEγ is sufficiently large, cf Fig. [\ref=fig:Meff]. To still obtain unweighted event samples, an ad-hoc approach is to simply drop events with negative events before proceeding further.

Negative event weights can be avoided by resumming higher-order initial radiation using an exponentiated structure function [formula] [\cite=Skrzypek:1990qs]. In order to avoid double-counting in the combination of the ISR-resummed LO result with the additional NLO contributions [\cite=Fritzsche:2004nf], we have subtract from the effective squared matrix element the soft and virtual photonic contributions that have already been accounted for in [formula]. This defines [formula] which is positive for even low ΔEγ cuts for all values of θ (cf Fig. [\ref=fig:Meff]), such that unweighting of generated events and realistic simulation at NLO are now possible in all regions of phase-space. Convoluting this with the resummed ISR structure function for each incoming beam, we obtain a modified 2  →  2 part of the total cross section which also includes soft and collinear photonic corrections to the Born/one-loop interference. This differs from the standard treatment in the literature (cf eg. [\cite=Fritzsche:2004nf]) where higher order photon contributions are combined with the Born term only ("Born+"). The complete result contains the hard non-collinear 2  →  3 part convoluted with the ISR structure function:

Results

Fig. [\ref=fig:edep] compares the ΔEγ dependence of the numerical results from the semianalytic fixed-order calculation with the Monte-Carlo integration in the fixed-order and in the resummation schemes. The fixed-order Monte-Carlo result agrees with the semianalytic result as long as the cutoff is greater than a few [formula] but departs from it for smaller cutoff values because here, in some parts of phase space, |Meff|2    <    0 is set to zero. The semianalytic fixed-order result is not exactly cutoff-independent, but exhibits a slight rise of the calculated cross section with increasing cutoff (breakdown of the soft approximation). For [formula] ([formula]) the shift is about [formula] ([formula]) of the total cross section. The fully resummed result shows an increase of about [formula] of the total cross section with respect to the fixed-order result which stays roughly constant until [formula]. This is due to higher-order photon radiation.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:histth] we show the binned distribution of the chargino production angle obtained using a sample of unweighted events. It demonstrates that NLO corrections (which, for total cross sections, are in the percent regime and can reach 20% at the threshold) are important and cannot be accounted for by a constant K factor. Figure [\ref=fig:secoeff] shows the magnitude of second and higher order photonic effects in different schemes. Resummation effects are clearly in the percent regime and cannot be neglected. For [formula], the convolution of the interference term with [formula] additionally changes the sign of the higher order corrections. For more details, cf. [\cite=Kilian:2006cj] [\cite=Robens:2006np].

Conclusions

We have implemented NLO corrections into the event generator WHIZARD for chargino pair-production at the ILC with several approaches for the inclusion of photon radiation. A careful analysis of the dependence on the cuts Δ  Eγ,  Δ  θ reveals uncertainties related to higher-order radiation and breakdown of the soft or collinear approximations. To carefully choose the resummation method and cutoffs will be critical for a truly precise analysis of real ILC data.The version of the program resumming photons allows to get rid of negative event weights, accounts for all yet known higher-order effects, allows for cutoffs small enough that soft- and collinear-approximation artefacts are negligible, and explicitly generates photons where they can be resolved experimentally. Corrections for the decays of charginos and non-factorizing corrections are in the line of future work.
