Abstract. Let k be any field, k(x,y) be the rational function field of two variables over k. Let σ be a k-automorphism of k(x,y) defined by

[formula]

Theorem. The fixed field k(x,y)〈σ〉 is rational (= purely transcendental) over k. Embodied in the proof of the above theorem are several general guidelines for solving the rationality problem of Cremona transformations, which may be applied elsewhere.

Introduction

Let k be any field, [formula] be the rational function field of n variables. (It is not necessary to assume that k is algebraically closed.) By a Cremona transformation on [formula] we mean a k-automorphism σ on [formula], i.e.

[formula]

where [formula] for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  n and σ is an automorphism. We will denote by [formula] the group of all Cremona transformations on [formula]. The purpose of this note is to consider whether k(x1,x2)G is rational (= purely transcendental) over k where G is some finite subgroup of [formula].

Note that, if k is algebraically closed, then k(x1,x2)G is rational over k by Zariski-Castelnuovo's Theorem [\cite=Za]. On the other hand, if the group G consists of automorphisms σ such that, in ([\ref=auto]), σ(xi) are homogeneous linear polynomials (resp. monomials) in [formula], then the group action of G on [formula] is the usual linear action (resp. the monomial group action). The rationality problem of linear actions or the monomial group actions has been investigated extensively. See, for examples, [\cite=Sw] [\cite=KP] [\cite=HK1] [\cite=HK2] [\cite=HR]. It seems that not many research works are devoted to the rationality problem of "genuine" Cremona transformations, i.e. the σ(xi) in ([\ref=auto]) are, instead of linear polynomials or monomials, but rational functions with total degrees high enough, say, ≥  4. As far as we know, only ad hoc techniques can be found in the literature for solving the rationality problems of Cremona transformations.

The main result of this note is the following theorem.

Let k be any field and k(x1,x2) be the rational function field of two variables over k. Let [formula] defined by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Then k(x1,x2)〈σ〉  : =   {f∈k(x1,x2) :σ(f)    =    f} is rational over k.

Note that σ2    =    1.

The above theorem was given in [\cite=HM]. Unfortunately the proof in [\cite=HM] contains a few mistakes. For examples, the σ1,σ2 defined in [\cite=HM] are not automorphisms. We will give another proof of Theorem [\ref=th1] in Section 2 (when [formula]) and Section 3 (when [formula], or 3). Our proof is completely different from that in [\cite=HM]. We hope that this proof will be helpful to people working on the rationality problem of Cremona transformations, because it contains systematic methods for attacking the rationality problem. (See Step 1, Step 2 and Step 5 of Section 2, in particular.) In keeping with the spirit of the proof in Section 2 we give another proof of the case [formula] and the case [formula] in Section 4 and Section 5 respectively.

Many rationality problems arise from the study of moduli spaces of some geometric configurations. The rationality problem in Theorem [\ref=th1] arose in the study of the moduli of cubic generic polynomials. See [\cite=HM].

Some symbolic computations in this note are carried out with the aid of "Mathematica" [\cite=Wo].

Finally we will emphasize that it is unnecessary to assume that the base field k is algebraically closed or any restriction on the characteristic of k.

The case [formula]

Throughout this section, we assume that [formula].

Step 1. Note that σ induces a birational map on [formula]. We will find some irreducible exceptional divisors of this rational map. Clearly the curve defined by 3x1 - 9x2 - x22    =    0   is one of the candidates. Taking its image σ(3x1 - 9x2 - x22), we will find another polynomial. Thus, define

[formula]

With the aid of computers, it is easy to see that

[formula]

Note that the determinant of the exponents of the above map is

[formula]

Thus the action of σ on k(y1,y2,y3) can be lifted to k(Y1,Y2,Y3) (Y1,Y2,Y3 are algebraically independent over k) and induces a monomial action on k(Y1,Y2,Y3). But we will not use this fact in the following steps.

Step 2. Luckily we find that k(y1,y2,y3)    =    k(x1,x2). In fact, from ([\ref=y123]), we may eliminate x2 and get two polynomial equations of x1 with coefficients in k(y1,y2,y3); applying the Euclidean algorithm to these two polynomials, we may show that x1∈k(y1,y2,y3).

More explicitly, with the aid of computers, we will find (i) the expressions of x1,x2 in terms of y1,y2,y3, and (ii) a polynomial equations of y1,y2,y3. We get

[formula]

[formula]

Step 3. The map of σ defined in ([\ref=actsy]) can be simplified as follows. Define

[formula]

It follows that k(y1,y2,y3)    =    k(z1,z2,z3) and

[formula]

The relation f(y1,y2,y3)    =    0   in ([\ref=fy1y2y3]) becomes

[formula]

Step 4. The map of σ defined in ([\ref=actsz]) is equivalent to

[formula]

Thus k(x1,x2)〈σ〉    =    k(z1,z2,z3)〈σ〉    =    k(u1,u2,u3) where u1,u2,u3 are defined by

[formula]

The relation g(z1,z2,z3)    =    0   in ([\ref=gz1z2z3]) becomes

[formula]

In conclusion, k(x1,x2)〈σ〉 is a field generated by u1,u2,u3 over k with the relation ([\ref=hu1u2u3]). We will simplify the relation ([\ref=hu1u2u3]) to get two generators.

Step 5. The relation ([\ref=hu1u2u3]) defines an algebraic surface. However this algebraic surfaces contains singularities. We will make some change of variables to simplify the singularities and the equation ([\ref=hu1u2u3]). Define

[formula]

Then k(u1,u2,u3)    =    k(v1,v2,v3) and the relation ([\ref=hu1u2u3]) becomes

[formula]

We will determine the singularities of h(v1,v2,v3) = 0 by solving

[formula]

We get v2 - 1    =    v1 - v3    =    0. Define

[formula]

Then k(v1,v2,v3)    =    k(w1,w2,w3) and the relation ([\ref=hv1v2v3]) becomes

[formula]

The above equation is a linear equation in w3. Thus w3∈k(w1,w2). It follows k(w1,w2,w3)    =    k(w1,w2). We conclude that k(x1,x2)〈σ〉    =    k(w1,w2,w3)    =    k(w1,w2) is rational over k.

Step 6. We will give explicit formulae of w1,w2 in terms of x1,x2. It is not difficult to find that

[formula]

We also see

[formula]

Finally we obtain

[formula]

The remaining cases

Step 1. In this step, we assume that [formula]. Note that the automorphism σ becomes

[formula]

Define

[formula]

Then we have k(x1,x2)    =    k(y1,y2) and

[formula]

Also define

[formula]

It follows that k(y1,y2)    =    k(z1,z2) and

[formula]

Therefore we obtain

[formula]

Step 2. In this step, we assume that [formula]. Note that the automorphism σ becomes

[formula]

Define

[formula]

It follows that k(x1,x2)    =    k(y1,y2) and

[formula]

Hence we get

[formula]

The case [formula]

In this section, we assume that [formula]. Recall that the automorphism σ is

[formula]

Define

[formula]

With the aid of computers, it is easy to see that

[formula]

From (4.1) , we find that

[formula]

And therefore we have that k(y1,y2,y3)    =    k(x1,x2). Using (4.1) to eliminate x1,x2, we obtain the relation

[formula]

Define

[formula]

It follows that k(y1,y2,y3)    =    k(z1,z2,z3) and

[formula]

We find that the relation f(y1,y2,y3)    =    0   in ([\ref=relych2]) becomes

[formula]

Define

[formula]

Then we have k(x1,x2)〈σ〉    =    k(z1,z2,z3)〈σ〉    =    k(u1,u2,u3) and the relation in ([\ref=relzch2]) becomes

[formula]

Thus u3∈k(u1,u2). It follows that k(x1,x2)〈σ〉    =    k(u1,u2,u3)    =    k(u1,u2) is rational over k. It is easy to obtain the formulae of the generators u1,u2 of k(x1,x2)〈σ〉 in terms of x1,x2. Indeed we have

[formula]

The case [formula]

In this section, we assume that [formula]. Recall that the automorphism σ is

[formula]

Define

[formula]

It is clear that k(x1,x2)    =    k(y1,y2,y3) and

[formula]

The map of σ above can be simplified as follows. Define

[formula]

It follows that k(y1,y2,y3)    =    k(z1,z2,z3) and

[formula]

We also obtain the relation

[formula]

Thus k(x1,x2)〈σ〉    =    k(z1,z2,z3)〈σ〉    =    k(u1,u2,u3) where u1,u2,u3 are defined by

[formula]

The relation g(z1,z2,z3)    =    0   in ([\ref=relzch3]) becomes

[formula]

We conclude that k(x1,x2)〈σ〉    =    k(u1,u2,u3)    =    k(u1,u2) is rational over k. The generators u1,u2 of k(x1,x2)〈σ〉 over k is given in terms of x1,x2 as follows:
