Introduction

Given a Lie algebra L, a grading on L is a decomposition of vector spaces [formula] such that [formula] and for each pair of indices i,j∈I there exists k∈I such that LiLj  ⊂  Lk (see Definition 2.1 below). Besides of its own mathematical interest, gradings on Lie algebras show up in numerous applications of physical nature.

As it was already pointed out by Patera et al. in a series of papers on the subject [\cite=pat0] [\cite=pat1] [\cite=pat2] [\cite=pat3] [\cite=pat4], gradings are in the background of the choice of bases and the additive quantum numbers, and are a key ingredient when studying contractions that keep "undeformed" certain subalgebra (e.g. see [\cite=klim]).

Gradings on Lie algebras also play a relevant role in quantum mechanics via Jordan algebras [\cite=jordan]: given a pair of indices i,j∈I verifying (LiLj)Li  ⊂  Li, any element k∈Lj gives rise to a Jordan algebra structure in Li by defining [formula].

Gradings on the algebras [formula] have been computed in [\cite=Ivan2] and [\cite=LGII] for [formula]. The case n = 8 is of special relevance because of its strong symmetry, reflected partly by the triality automorphism. This makes that our matrices algebra is usually considered as a exceptional Lie algebra. Some works with a treatment of gradings on exceptional Lie algebras are [\cite=g2] [\cite=f4]. Here we describe in detail all the fourteen fine gradings on [formula] (see Section 3). The proof showing that these are all the fine gradings is lengthy and cannot be included here, so it will appear in [\cite=d4].

Basic concepts

In this minimal section, we introduce the basic concepts we use along this manuscript.

Definition 2.1.   A grading on a Lie algebra L over a group G is a decomposition in vector spaces [formula] such that LgLh  ⊂  Lgh for all g,h∈G (sometimes called group grading). It will also be required that G is generated by [formula]. We say that a grading is of type [formula] when there are hi components of dimension i, and s is the greatest nonzero dimension of a component.

Definition 2.2.   A grading is called fine when it cannot be refined. A refinement of the grading [formula] is another (group) grading [formula] such that each component Lg is sum of several components Mh.

Example 2.1.   The main example of a fine grading is the root decomposition in a simple Lie algebra, which turns out to be a grading over [formula], for l the rank of the algebra.

From now on, L will denote the algebra of skewsymmetric matrices [formula]. Let eij be the elementary matrix with (i,j)-entry 1, and the remaining entries zero, and define bij = eji - eij. Then [formula] is a basis of L, and the following section describes the fine gradings on L in terms of this base.

Recall that a grading on L is always the simultaneous diagonalization relative to a commuting set of semisimple automorphisms (more details in [\cite=g2]). The grading is fine when it is produced by a maximal subgroup of semisimple automorphisms, which is usually called a MAD.

The fine gradings

We introduce some useful elements of [formula] to describe the gradings on L.

Notice that [formula] for all [formula]. Thus we can use the adjoint map to obtain automorphisms of L by means of [formula], [formula]. In particular, denote [formula] and [formula]. With all these elements, we are prepared to describe completely the group of automorphisms producing each grading, denoted by Qi. We also provide the simultaneous diagonalization, which is a straightforward computation by means of any computer algebra software.

Grading over [formula]: [formula] is an abelian diagonalizable subgroup of [formula]. In fact it is maximal according to [\cite=LGII] (it is the MAD corresponding to T(1)2,2). Hence it produces a fine grading, of type (25,0,1), whose homogeneous components are:

[formula]

[formula]

The indices of the components are not the indices of the grading, but the eigenvalues that [formula] act with (e.g. the index [formula] is for the element [formula]). The universal group of the grading (see [\cite=g2] for the definition) is just [formula]. These comments about the universal group and the order and eigenvalues of the automorphisms, are valid for all the gradings in this paper.

Grading over [formula]: [formula] is an abelian diagonalizable subgroup of [formula]. In fact, it is the MAD corresponding to T(1)4,0 ([\cite=LGII]). The simultaneous diagonalization of L relative to this subgroup of automorphisms is of type (20,4):

The simultaneous diagonalization of L relative to the quasitorus Q10 is of type (24,0,0,1). Of course it is the Cartan grading, in other words, the decomposition in root spaces relative to the Cartan subalgebra L1,1,1,1  =  〈b1,2,  b3,4,  b5,6,  b7,8〉:

Grading over [formula]: [formula] is also a MAD of [formula], corresponding to T(3)0,1. The induced grading is of type (28):

[formula]

In order to describe the gradings involving a copy of [formula], we introduce new automorphisms. Fix [formula] a basis of L of root vectors (take the basis produced by Q10, suitably ordered, to express the remaining three gradings also in terms of bij), and let φi,j(bk) = δk,jbi for [formula]. Define
