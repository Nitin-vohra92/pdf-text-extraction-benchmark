The Morse-Bott inequalities via dynamical systems

Introduction

Let [formula] be a Morse function on a compact smooth manifold of dimension m. The Morse inequalities say that

[formula]

for all [formula] (with ≥   an equality when n = m), where νk is the number of critical points of h of index k and bk is the [formula] Betti number of M for all k. These inequalities follow from the fact that the Morse function h determines a CW-complex X whose cellular homology is isomorphic to the singular homology of M (the k-cells of X are in bijective correspondence with the critical points of index k).

In [\cite=WitSup] Witten introduced the idea that the Morse inequalities can be studied by deforming the de Rham differential on differential forms by the differential of the Morse function. This led him to consider a chain complex whose chains are generated by the critical points of the Morse function and whose differential is defined by counting the gradient flow lines between critical points of relative index one (the so-called Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex). See also [\cite=BotMor]. The homology of this complex is called the "Morse homology", and the Morse Homology Theorem asserts that the Morse homology is isomorphic to the singular homology (see [\cite=BanLec] and [\cite=SchMor]). For an excellent exposition of Witten's ideas see [\cite=HenLes].

On one hand Bismut, and on the other hand, Helffer and Sjöstrand have given rigorous mathematical derivations of Witten's analytical ideas [\cite=BisThe][\cite=HelApr]. In this way, they proved the Morse inequalities and the Morse-Bott inequalities, which relate the Betti numbers of M and the Betti numbers of the critical submanifolds of a Morse-Bott function on M, without using the Morse Homology Theorem.

In this paper, we present a proof of the Morse-Bott inequalities using ideas from dynamical systems. The proof uses the Morse inequalities, the Morse Homology Theorem, and an explicit perturbation technique that produces a Morse-Smale function h arbitrarily close to a given Morse-Bott function f [\cite=AbbLec] [\cite=AusMor]. Roughly, the perturbation h of f is constructed as follows. We first fix a Riemannian metric on M and apply the Kupka-Smale Theorem to choose Morse-Smale functions fj on the critical submanifolds Cj for [formula]. Next, we extend the Morse-Smale functions fj to tubular neighborhoods Tj of the critical submanifolds, and we define

[formula]

where ρj is a bump function on Tj and ε  >  0. We then apply a well-known folk theorem (whose proof can be found in Section 2.12 of [\cite=AbbLec]) which says that we can perturb the Riemannian metric on M outside of the union of the tubular neighborhoods Tj for [formula] so that h satisfies the Morse-Smale transversality condition with respect to the perturbed metric.

Once we know that h and fj for [formula] satisfy the Morse-Smale transversality condition, we can compare the Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex of h to the Morse-Smale-Witten chain complexes of fj for [formula]. This allows us to show that the coefficients of the polynomial R(t) in Theorem [\ref=MorseBottineq] are nonnegative. The proof works when the manifold M and all the critical submanifolds are oriented or when [formula] coefficients are used.

The Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex

In this section we briefly recall the construction of the Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex and the Morse Homology Theorem. For more details see [\cite=BanLec].

Let Cr(f)  =  {p∈M|  dfp  =  0} denote the set of critical points of a smooth function [formula] on a smooth m-dimensional manifold M. A critical point p∈Cr(f) is said to be nondegenerate if and only if the Hessian Hp(f) is nondegenerate. The index λp of a nondegenerate critical point p is the dimension of the subspace of TpM where Hp(f) is negative definite. If all the critical points of f are non-degenerate, then f is called a Morse function.

If [formula] is a Morse function on a finite dimensional compact smooth Riemannian manifold (M,g), then the stable manifold Ws(p) and the unstable manifold Wu(p) of a critical point p∈Cr(f) are defined to be

[formula]

where φt is the 1-parameter group of diffeomorphisms generated by minus the gradient vector field, i.e. [formula]. The index of p coincides with the dimension of Wu(p). The Stable/Unstable Manifold Theorem for a Morse Function says that the tangent space at p splits as

[formula]

where the Hessian is positive definite on [formula] and negative definite on [formula]. Moreover, the stable and unstable manifolds of p are surjective images of smooth embeddings

[formula]

Hence, Ws(p) is a smoothly embedded open disk of dimension m  -  λp, and Wu(p) is a smoothly embedded open disk of dimension λp.

If the stable and unstable manifolds of a Morse function [formula] all intersect transversally, then the function f is called Morse-Smale. Note that for a given Morse function [formula] one can choose a Riemannian metric on M so that f is Morse-Smale with respect to the chosen metric (see Theorem 2.20 of [\cite=AbbLec]). Moreover, if f is Morse-Smale then [formula] is an embedded submanifold of M of dimension λq  -  λp, and when λq  =  λp  +  1 one can use Palis' λ-Lemma to prove that the number of gradient flow lines from q to p is finite.

If we assume that M is oriented and we choose an orientation for each of the unstable manifolds of f, then there is an induced orientation on the stable manifolds. Thus, we can define an integer n(q,p) associated to any two critical points p and q of relative index one by counting the number of gradient flow lines from q to p with signs determined by the orientations. If M is not orientable, then we can still define [formula] by counting the number of gradient flow lines from q to p [formula].

The Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex is defined to be the chain complex [formula] where Ck(f) is the free abelian group generated by the critical points q of index k (tensored with [formula] when n(q,p) is defined as an element of [formula]) and the boundary operator ∂k:Ck(f)  →  Ck - 1(f) is given by

[formula]

The pair [formula] is a chain complex. If M is orientable and the boundary operator is defined with [formula], then the homology of [formula] is isomorphic to the singular homology [formula]. If the boundary operator is defined with [formula], then the homology of [formula] is isomorphic to the singular homology [formula].

Note that the Morse Homology Theorem implies that the homology of [formula] is independent of the Morse-Smale function [formula], the Riemannian metric, and the orientations.

The Morse Inequalities

Let M be a compact smooth manifold of dimension m. When M is orientable we define the [formula] Betti number of M, denoted bk, to be the rank of the [formula] homology group [formula] modulo its torsion subgroup. When M is not orientable we define [formula]. Let [formula] be a Morse function on M, and let νk be the number of critical points of f of index k for all [formula]. As a consequence of the Morse Homology Theorem we have

[formula]

for all [formula] since [formula] and [formula] (or [formula]) is a quotient of Ck(f). These inequalities are known as the weak Morse inequalities.

The Poincaré polynomial of M is defined to be

[formula]

and the Morse polynomial of f is defined to be

[formula]

The Morse inequalities stated in the introduction are known as the strong Morse inequalities. The strong Morse inequalities are equivalent to the following polynomial Morse inequalities. (For a proof see Lemma 3.43 of [\cite=BanLec].) It is this version of the Morse inequalities that we generalize to Morse-Bott functions.

For any Morse function [formula] on a smooth manifold M we have

[formula]

where R(t) is a polynomial with non-negative integer coefficients. That is, [formula] where [formula] satisfies rk  ≥  0 for all [formula].

Although Theorem [\ref=Morsepolynomial] and its proof are standard facts, we give here a detailed proof using the Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex because this proof gives an explicit formula rk  =  νk + 1  -  zk + 1 for the coefficients of the polynomial R(t) which we will use in the proof of Theorem [\ref=MorseBottineq].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Morsepolynomial]: Let [formula] be a Morse function on a finite dimensional compact smooth manifold M, and choose a Riemannian metric on M for which f is a Morse-Smale function. Let Ck(f) denote the [formula] chain group in the Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex of f (with coefficients in either [formula] or [formula]), and let ∂k:Ck(f)  →  Ck - 1(f) denote the [formula] Morse-Smale-Witten boundary operator. The rank of Ck(f) is equal to the number νk of critical points of f of index k, and by the Morse Homology Theorem (Theorem [\ref=Morsehomology]) the rank of [formula] is equal to bk, the [formula] Betti number of M for all [formula].

Let [formula] for all [formula]. The exact sequence

[formula]

implies that [formula] for all [formula], and

[formula]

implies that [formula] for all [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

Therefore, Mt(f)  =  Pt(M)  +  (1 + t)R(t) where [formula]. Note that νk + 1  -  zk + 1  ≥  0 for all [formula] because zk + 1 is the rank of a subgroup of Ck + 1(f) and [formula].

[formula]

The Morse-Bott Inequalities

Let [formula] be a smooth function whose critical set [formula] contains a submanifold C of positive dimension. Pick a Riemannian metric on M and use it to split [formula] as

[formula]

where [formula] is the tangent space of C and [formula] is the normal bundle of C. Let p∈C, V∈TpC, W∈TpM, and let Hp(f) be the Hessian of f at p. We have

[formula]

since Vp∈TpC and any extension of W to a vector field W̃ satisfies df(W̃)|C =  0. Therefore, the Hessian Hp(f) induces a symmetric bilinear form Hνp(f) on νpC.

A smooth function [formula] on a smooth manifold M is called a Morse-Bott function if and only if the set of critical points [formula] is a disjoint union of connected submanifolds and for each connected submanifold [formula] the bilinear form Hνp(f) is non-degenerate for all p∈C.

Often one says that the Hessian of a Morse-Bott function f is non-degenerate in the direction normal to the critical submanifolds.

For a proof of the following lemma see Section 3.5 of [\cite=BanLec] or [\cite=BanApr].

Let [formula] be a Morse-Bott function and [formula] a connected component. For any p∈C there is a local chart of M around p and a local splitting [formula], identifying a point x∈M in its domain to (u,v,w) where u∈C, [formula], [formula], such that within this chart f assumes the form

[formula]

Let [formula] be a Morse-Bott function on a finite dimensional smooth manifold M, and let C be a critical submanifold of f. For any p∈C let λp denote the index of Hνp(f). This integer is the dimension of ν-pC and is locally constant by the preceding lemma. If C is connected, then λp is constant throughout C and we call λp  =  λC the Morse-Bott index of the connected critical submanifold C.

Let [formula] be a Morse-Bott function on a finite dimensional compact smooth manifold, and assume that

[formula]

where [formula] are disjoint connected critical submanifolds.

The Morse-Bott polynomial of f is defined to be

[formula]

where λj is the Morse-Bott index of the critical submanifold Cj and Pt(Cj) is the Poincaré polynomial of Cj.

Note: Clearly MBt(f) reduces to Mt(f) when f is a Morse function. Also, if M or any of the critical submanifolds are not orientable, then [formula] coefficients are used to compute all the Betti numbers.

The following result is due to Bott. In fact, Bott proved a more general version of this result (without the assumption that the critical submanifolds are orientable) using homology with local coefficients in an orientation bundle [\cite=BotNon] [\cite=BotLec].

Let [formula] be a Morse-Bott function on a finite dimensional oriented compact smooth manifold, and assume that all the critical submanifolds of f are orientable. Then there exists a polynomial R(t) with non-negative integer coefficients such that

[formula]

If either M or some of the critical submanifolds are not orientable, then this equation holds when [formula] coefficients are used to define the Betti numbers.

A perturbation technique and the proof of the main theorem

To prove Theorem [\ref=MorseBottineq] we will use the following perturbation technique based on [\cite=AusMor], the Morse-Bott Lemma, and a folk theorem proved in [\cite=AbbLec]. This construction produces an explicit Morse-Smale function [formula] arbitrarily close to a given Morse-Bott function [formula] such that h  =  f outside of a neighborhood of the critical set [formula].

Let Tj be a small tubular neighborhood around each connected component [formula] for all [formula] with local coordinates (u,v,w) consistent with those from the Morse-Bott Lemma (Lemma [\ref=MorseBottLemma]). By "small" we mean that each Tj is contained in the union of the domains of the charts from the Morse-Bott Lemma, for i  ≠  j we have [formula] and f decreases by at least three times [formula] along any gradient flow line from Ti to Tj where [formula], and if f(Ci)  ≠  f(Cj), then

[formula]

Pick a Riemannian metric on M such that the charts from the Morse-Bott Lemma are isometries with respect to the standard Euclidean metric on [formula], and then pick positive Morse functions [formula] that are Morse-Smale with respect to the restriction of the Riemannian metric to Cj for all [formula]. The Morse-Smale functions [formula] exist by the Kupka-Smale Theorem (see for instance Theorem 6.6. of [\cite=BanLec]).

For every [formula] extend fj to a function on Tj by making fj constant in the direction normal to Cj, i.e. fj is constant in the v and w coordinates coming from the Morse-Bott Lemma. Let T̃j  ⊂  Tj be a smaller tubular neighborhood of Cj with the same coordinates as Tj, and let ρj be a smooth nonincreasing bump function which is constant in the u coordinates, equal to 1 on T̃j, and equal to 0 outside of Tj. Choose ε  >  0 small enough so that

[formula]

for all [formula], and define

[formula]

The function [formula] is a Morse function close to f, and the critical points of h are exactly the critical points of the fj for [formula]. Moreover, if p∈Cj is a critical point of [formula] of index λjp, then p is a critical point of h of index λhp  =  λj  +  λjp.

We now apply a well-known folk theorem (whose proof can be found in Section 2.12 of [\cite=AbbLec]) which says that we can perturb the Riemannian metric on M outside of the union of the tubular neighborhoods Tj for [formula] so that h satisfies the Morse-Smale transversality condition with respect to the perturbed metric. In summary, we have achieved the following conditions.

The gradient [formula] outside of the union of the tubular neighborhoods Tj for [formula]. Moreover, the tubular neighborhood Tj are chosen small enough so that the following condition holds: if f(Ci)  ≤  f(Cj) for some i  ≠  j, then there are no gradient flow lines of h from Ci to Cj.

The charts from the Morse-Bott Lemma are isometries with respect to the metric on M and the standard Euclidean metric on [formula].

In the local coordinates (u,v,w) of a tubular neighborhood Tj we have f  =  f(C) - |v|2  +  |w|2, ρj depends only on the v and w coordinates, and fj depends only on the u coordinates. In particular, [formula] on Tj by the previous condition.

The function h  =  f  +  εfj on the tubular neighborhood T̃j.

The gradient [formula] dominates [formula] on Tj  -  T̃j.

The functions [formula] and [formula] satisfy the Morse-Smale transversality condition for all [formula].

For every [formula] we have the following description of the [formula] Morse-Smale-Witten chain group of h in terms of the Morse-Smale-Witten chain groups of the fj for [formula].

[formula]

Now, let [formula] denote the Morse-Smale-Witten boundary operator of h, and let [formula] denote the Morse-Smale-Witten boundary operator of fj for [formula].

If p,q∈Cj are critical points of [formula] of relative index one, then the coefficients n(q,p) used to define the Morse-Smale-Witten boundary operator are the same for [formula] and [formula] (assuming in the case where Cj is orientable that the appropriate orientation of Cj has been chosen).

Proof: We have h  =  f  +  εfj on T̃j by condition ([\ref=three]). This implies that [formula] on T̃j, and [formula] on the critical submanifold Cj. Moreover, by conditions ([\ref=two]) and ([\ref=four]) a gradient flow line of h cannot begin and end in Cj unless the entire flow line is contained in Cj. Thus, if p and q are both in Cj the flows connecting them along the gradient flow lines of h and of fj are the same, and the numbers n(q,p) in the complex of h and of fj are the same as long as the orientations are chosen appropriately.

[formula]

We now order the connected critical submanifolds [formula] by height, i.e. such that f(Ci)  ≤  f(Cj) whenever i  ≤  j. For α∈Cn(h) and Cj a connected critical submanifold we denote by αj the chain obtained from α by retaining only those critical points belonging to Cj. By condition ([\ref=decomposition]), any α  ≠  0 can be written uniquely as:

[formula]

where [formula] and αji∈Cki(fji)  -  {0} where λji  +  ki  =  n. We will refer to αjr as the "top part" of the chain α.

If α is a non-zero element in [formula], then the top part of α is a non-zero element in the kernel of [formula] for some j, i.e. using the above notation for [formula] we have [formula] where λjr  +  kr  =  n.

Proof: Let [formula], i.e.

[formula]

Then [formula] for all p∈Crn - 1(h), and in particular, for [formula]. For any [formula] we have f(qi)  ≤  f(p) for all qi in the sum of α such that [formula], and thus there are no gradient flow lines of h from qi to p by condition ([\ref=fandh]). Therefore, n(qi,p)  =  0 if [formula] and [formula], i.e.

[formula]

when [formula]. Lemma [\ref=boundarylemma] then implies that ∂fjrkr(αjr)  =

[formula]

where λjr  +  kr  =  n and [formula].

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=MorseBottineq]: Let f, h, fj for [formula], and the Riemannian metric on M be as above. Let Mt(fj) denote the Morse polynomial of [formula], and let [formula] for all [formula]. Note that the relation λhp  =  λj  +  λjp implies that

[formula]

The polynomial Morse inequalities (Theorem [\ref=Morsepolynomial]) say that

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Rh(t) and Rj(t) are polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients for all [formula].

[formula]

In the proof of the polynomial Morse inequalities we saw that

[formula]

where νjk is the rank of the group Ck(fj) and zjk is the rank of the kernel of the boundary operator ∂fjk:Ck(fj)  →  Ck - 1(fj) in the Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex of [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

where νhn denotes the rank of the chain group Cn(h) and zhn denotes the rank of the kernel of the Morse-Smale-Witten boundary operator ∂hn:Cn(h)  →  Cn - 1(h). Since the critical points of h coincide with the critical points of the functions fj for [formula], and a critical point p∈Cj of fj of index λjp is a critical point of h of index λj  +  λjp we have

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

where

[formula]

To see that [formula] for all [formula] we apply Corollary [\ref=toppart] as follows. If zhn  >  0, then we can choose a nonzero element [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=toppart], the "top part" of β1 is a nonzero element in [formula] for some k and j such that λj  +  k  =  n. If zhn  =  1, then we are done. If zhn  >  1, then we can find an element [formula] that is not in the group generated by β1, and by adding a multiple of β1 to β2 if necessary, we can choose β2 such that the top part of β2 is a nonzero element that is not in the subgroup generated by the top part of β1. Continuing in this fashion we can find generators for [formula] whose top parts are independent elements in

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]
