Asymptotic behavior of growth functions of D0L-systems

Introduction

Notation

As usual, [formula], [formula] and [formula] denote the semiring of natural integers, the field of real numbers, and the field of complex numbers, respectively. For every a, [formula], [formula] denotes the set of all integers n such that a  ≤  n  ≤  b. Let f, [formula]. We write [formula] if there exists a real number λ  >  0 such that [formula] is finite. We write [formula] if both [formula] and [formula] hold.

A word is a finite string of symbols. Word concatenation is denoted multiplicatively. For every word w, the length of w is denoted [formula]. The word of length zero is called the empty word. For every symbol a and every word w, [formula] denotes the number of occurrences of a in w.

An alphabet is a finite set of symbols. Let A be an alphabet. The set of all words over A is denoted [formula]. A mapping [formula] is called a morphism if σ(xy)  =  σ(x)σ(y) for every x, [formula]. Clearly, σ is completely determined by its restriction to A. For every [formula], σn denotes the [formula] iterate of σ: for every [formula], σ0(w)  =  w, σ1(w)  =  σ(w), σ2(w)  =  σ(σ(w)), σ3(w)  =  σ(σ(σ(w))), etc.

A D0L-system [\cite=Lindenmayer68] is defined as a triple (A,σ,w) where A is an alphabet, σ is a morphism from [formula] to itself, and w is a word over A. The growth function of the D0L-system (A,σ,w) is defined as the integer sequence [formula]. For every D0L-system (A,σ,w), either the sequence [formula] is eventually periodic or [formula].

Contribution

The aim of the paper is to present a short, elementary proof of the following theorem.

Let (A,σ,w) be a D0L-system such that σn(w) is a non-empty word for every [formula]. There exist a non-negative integer α smaller than the cardinality of A, and a real number β  ≥  1 such that [formula] as n  →    ∞  .

Theorem [\ref=th:D0L-growth] plays a crucial role in the proof of an important result: Pansiot's theorem concerning the complexity of pure morphic sequences [\cite=Pansiot84].

In 1978, Salomaa and Soittola laboriously proved a stronger result than Theorem [\ref=th:D0L-growth].

Let (A,σ,w) be a D0L-system such that σn(w) is a non-empty word for every [formula]. There exist a positive integer q, a non-negative integer α smaller than the cardinality of A, and a real number β  ≥  1 such that for each [formula],

[formula]

converges to a positive, finite limit as n  →    ∞  .

The proof of Theorem [\ref=th:D0L-growth] presented below cannot likely be refined into a proof of Theorem [\ref=th:SS]. The original proof of Theorem [\ref=th:SS] relies on the theory of rational power series. In particular, two deep results are put to use:

Schützenberger's representation theorem [\cite=SalomaaS78] [\cite=BerstelR88], and

Berstel's theorem concerning the minimum-modulus poles of univariate rational series over the semiring of non-negative real numbers [\cite=SalomaaS78] [\cite=BerstelR88].

To conclude this section note that a very interesting particular case of Theorem [\ref=th:SS] can be simply deduced from the Perron-Frobenius theory.

Let A be an alphabet and let [formula] be a morphism. We say that σ is irreducible if for each (a,b)∈A  ×  A, there exists [formula] such that a occurs in σk(b). For every a∈A, the period of a under σ is defined as the greatest common divisor of [formula].

If the morphism σ is irreducible then all letters in A have the same period under σ. If σ is irreducible and if every letter in A is of period one under σ then σ is called primitive: there exists [formula] such that for each (a,b)∈A  ×  A, a occurs in σN(b).

Let A be an alphabet, let [formula] be an irreducible morphism, and let q denote the period under σ of any letter in A. There exists a real number β  ≥  1 such that for each (a,b)∈A  ×  A and each [formula],

[formula]

converges to a positive, finite limit as n  →    ∞  .

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:D0L-growth]

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=th:D0L-growth] relies on the equivalence of norms on a finite-dimensional vector space (see Theorem [\ref=th:equiv-norm] below). For the sake of completeness, the definition of a norm is recalled.

Let V be a real or complex vector space. A norm on V is a mapping [formula] from V to [formula] such that the following three properties hold for all vectors x, y∈V and all scalars [formula]:

[formula] if, and only if, x is the zero vector,

[formula], and

[formula].

Let V be a real or complex vector space. If the dimension of V is finite then for any norms [formula] and [formula] on V, there exist positive real numbers λ and μ such that [formula] for every x∈V.

Throughout this section d denotes a positive integer and [formula] denotes the algebra of d-by-d complex matrices. The following two classical norms on [formula] play a central role in our discussion.

For every [formula], define [formula] as the Manhattan norm of X: [formula] equals the sum of the magnitudes of the entries of X.

For every [formula], define [formula] as the maximum norm of X: [formula] equals the maximum magnitude of the entries of X.

It is clear that [formula] for every [formula].

The next proposition, which is mainly folklore, is the main ingredient of the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:D0L-growth].

For each non-nilpotent matrix [formula], there exist a norm [formula] on [formula], an integer [formula] and a real number β  >  0 such that the ratio [formula] converges to a positive, finite limit as n  →    ∞  .

Let [formula] be a non-singular matrix such that PMP- 1 is in Jordan normal form: there exist D, [formula] such that D is diagonal, N is nilpotent, PMP- 1  =  D  +  N and DN  =  ND. Let [formula] be the norm on [formula] defined by: [formula] for every [formula].

For all i, [formula], let [formula] be the function mapping each [formula] to the [formula] entry of PMnP- 1. It is clear that [formula] for every [formula]. Let I be the set of all [formula] such that ei,j  is not eventually zero. Since M is not nilpotent, I is non-empty, and thus

[formula]

for every sufficiently large [formula].

For each [formula], the binomial theorem yields:

[formula]

Besides, Nk is a zero matrix for every integer k  ≥  d, and thus

[formula]

for every integer n  ≥  d  -  1. Hence, for each (i,j)∈I, there exist a non-zero eigenvalue λi of D and a non-zero complex polynomial fi,j with deg fi,j  ≤  d  -  1 such that

[formula]

for every integer n  ≥  d  -  1:

Let (β,α) be the maximum element of [formula] according to the lexicographical order. Let J denote the set of all (i,j)∈I such that [formula], and for each (i,j)∈J, let ci,j denote the leading coefficient of fi,j. It is clear that

[formula]

for every (i,j)∈I, so

[formula]

It follows from Theorem [\ref=th:equiv-norm] that for any norms [formula] and [formula] on [formula] and for any [formula], [formula] as n  →    ∞  , so we get:

For each matrix [formula], there exist an integer [formula] and a real number β  ≥  0 such that for every norm [formula] on [formula], [formula] as n  →    ∞  .

Proposition [\ref=prop:norm-mat] deserves several comments. First, a more precise result is known.

Let [formula] denote the spectral norm on [formula] and let [formula] be such that M is not nilpotent.

Let β denote the spectral radius of M.

Let j denote the maximum size of the Jordan blocks of M with spectral radius β.

The ratio [formula] converges to a positive, finite limit as n  →    ∞  .

Let us also mention that a weak version of Theorem [\ref=th:Varga] holds in an arbitrary Banach algebra.

Let A be a complex Banach algebra and let [formula] denote its norm. For every M∈A, [formula] converges to the spectral radius of M as n  →    ∞  .

Let us now illustrate Proposition [\ref=prop:norm-mat] and Corollary [\ref=cor:equiv-norm] with an example. The matrix

[formula]

is diagonalizable:

[formula]

where i denotes the imaginary unit,

[formula]

Let [formula] be the norm on [formula] defined by: [formula] for every [formula]. For every [formula], we have

[formula]

where θ is an argument of λ; so

[formula]

Noteworthy is that no entry of 5- nMn converges as n  →    ∞  : both sets [formula] and [formula] are dense subsets of the closed real interval with endpoints - 1 and + 1 (see appendix).

We turn back to the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:D0L-growth].

Let A be an alphabet, let [formula] be a morphism and let w, [formula]. If x occurs in σn0(w) for some [formula] then [formula] as n  →    ∞  .

Let [formula]. If x occurs in σn0(w) then for every [formula], σn(x) occurs in σn  +  n0(w), and thus

[formula]

A D0L-system (A,σ,w) is called reduced if for every a∈A there exists [formula] such that a occurs in σm(w).

For any reduced D0L-system (A,σ,w),

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  .

For every [formula], let

[formula]

First, we have

[formula]

and thus [formula]. Conversely, Lemma [\ref=lem:occur-O] ensures [formula] for each a∈A because the D0L-system (A,σ,w) is reduced. It follows [formula].

Let us first check that, without loss of generality, we may assume that (A,σ,w) is reduced. Let Ā denote the set of all symbols a∈A such that a occurs in σm(w) for some [formula]. Remark that [formula]: for any a∈Ā and any [formula] such that a occurs in σm(w), σ(a) occurs in σm  +  1(w), and thus [formula]. Hence σ induces a morphism [formula]: (x)  =  σ(x) for every [formula]. Clearly, (Ā,,w) is a reduced D0L-system and σn(w)  =  n(w) for every [formula]. Therefore, we may replace (A,σ,w) with (Ā,,w) in the remaining of the proof, so [\eqref=eq:sigmaw-suma] holds by Lemma [\ref=lem:asymp-sum].

Let d denote the cardinality of A. Write arbitrarily A in the form [formula]. Let M be the d-by-d matrix defined by: for all i, [formula], the [formula] entry of M equals [formula]. The [formula] entry of Mn equals [formula], and thus

[formula]

It follows from Corollary [\ref=cor:equiv-norm] that there exist an integer [formula] and a real number β  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eq:sigmaw-suma], [\eqref=eq:sum-norm] and [\eqref=eq:NorMn-alpha-beta], we get [formula]. Since [formula] for every [formula], nαβn does not converge to zero, and thus β  ≥  1.

Appendix

Throughout the section,

π denotes Archimedes' constant,

[formula], and

[formula].

The aim of this appendix is to prove the following proposition:

For any argument θ of 4  +  3i, both sets [formula] and [formula] are dense subsets of J.

Proposition [\ref=prop:dense-theta] is a consequence of the following two well-known results.

Let ρ be a rational number. If cos (2πρ) is rational then 2 cos (2πρ) is an integer.

Both complex numbers exp (2πρi) and exp ( - 2πρi) are algebraic integers. Indeed, they are roots of the monic integer polynomial zq  -  1, where q is a positive integer such that qρ is an integer. Since a sum of algebraic integers is also an algebraic integer [\cite=KaplanskyGreen], 2 cos (2πρ)  =   exp (2πρi)  +   exp ( - 2πρi) is an algebraic integer. If  cos (2πρ) is rational then 2 cos (2πρ) is in fact an integer because an algebraic integer, if rational, is an integer [\cite=HardyWright].

Note that for any real number θ with -  π  ≤  θ  ≤  π, the following three assertions are equivalent:

2 cos (θ) is an integer,

[formula], and

[formula].

For any irrational number [formula], [formula] is a dense subset of I.

Since the cosine of θ equals [formula], [formula] is irrational by Proposition [\ref=prop:cos-irrational]. Hence, [formula] is a dense subset of I by Proposition [\ref=prop:rho-irrational]. Since the function f:I  →  J that maps each x∈I to cos (2πx) is continuous and surjective, [formula] is a dense subset of J. In the same way, the function g:I  →  J that maps each x∈I to sin (2πx) is continuous, surjective and such that [formula].
