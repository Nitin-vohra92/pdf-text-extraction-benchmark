Comment - Practical Data Protection

Data Protection using "Disclaimer Statement"

Recently, Rawat and Saxena [\cite=rwa08] proposed a method for securing data using "disclaimer statement" in email. Typically, the disclaimer statement is appended at the end of email. But, Rawat and Saxena intended to put the disclaimer statement at the beginning of the email. They claim that their method achieves the following characteristics: We refer interested reader to [\cite=rwa08] for a quick review of their proposal. In next section, we show that none of the their claims provides any data protection mechanisms.

Comments and Remarks

I cannot see any data protection method in Rawat and Saxena's method [\cite=rwa08]. They neither provide any methods for data confidentiality nor safeguard data privacy. The picture of their proposal [\cite=rwa08] would be pretty clear from the following comments, which one could easily observe these flaws from their proposal.

Conclusion

I do not see any data protection mechanism of Rawat and Saxena's method; however, they provide a good pointer which could be used for email protection by some additional measures such as appropriateness of disclaimer statement's position and phrases on top of other security properties of email messaging. Nevertheless, while writing this note, "disclaimer statement" has not found enough potentials to stop other encryption methods, consequently, making statement "...this new method makes all encryption method obsolete" in [\cite=rwa08] is a baseless statement/claim. I guess, disclaimer method may provide some sort of data protection in the future to come by some additional measures, and lets see how much we can utilize this idea for protecting (practical) data.
