The Non-triviality of the Grope Filtrations of The Knot and Link Concordance Groups

Lemma Corollary Proposition Definition Example

Introduction

We work in the smooth category. A knot is a smooth embedding of the circle in the three-sphere. Two knots are isotopic if there is a smooth isotopy of the three-sphere taking one knot the the other. Isotopy is a three-dimensional notion of knot equivalence. In this paper, we study a four-dimensional notion of knot equivalence called concordance. Two knots K0 and K1 are concordant if there exists a smooth embedding of an annulus A = S1  ×  [0,1] into S3  ×  [0,1] such that [formula] for i = 0,1. One can check that isotopic knots are concordant, and one can find counterexamples to the converse. Given two knots, one can combine them via the connect sum operation, denoted #  . See [\cite=dR76] for more details. The set of knots modulo concordance, equipped with the connect sum operation, forms an abelian group. We wish to study this concordance group C.

In [\cite=COT03], Cochran, Orr, and Teichner introduced two filtrations of the knot concordance group by subgroups. The (n)-solvable filtration

[formula]

is defined loosely by K∈Fn if 0-surgery on K bounds a 4-manifold whose first and second homology groups satisfy certain conditions related to the n-th derived subgroup of that 4-manifold. The precise definition will be provided in Section [\ref=definitions]. It is true that a slice knot lies in Fn for all [formula]. In other words, this filtration measures how far algebraically a knot is from being slice (take, for example, the highest n for which K∈Fn but [formula]).

The other filtration defined in [\cite=COT03] is the Grope filtration

[formula]

which is defined by K∈Gn if K bounds a Grope of height n in D4. A Grope is a 2-complex that will be defined in Section [\ref=definitions]. As in the (n)-solvable filtration, a slice knot lies in Gn for all n, and so the highest n for which K∈Gn but [formula] is some measure on how far geometrically K is from being slice.

The non-triviality of the (n)-solvable filtration has been a topic of study since its introduction. That Fn  /  Fn.5 has infinite rank was proved by Jiang in [\cite=bJ81] for n = 1, by Cochran, Orr and Teichner in [\cite=COT04] for n = 2, and by Cochran, Harvey and Leidy in [\cite=CHL07b] for all n. Our main result is an analogous statement for the Grope filtration.

Our main result improves upon previous results regarding the non-triviality of the Grope filtration. For example, Cochran and Teichner proved in [\cite=CT07] the existence of knots of infinite order in Gn  /  Gn.5. Our method of constructing knots bounding Gropes is similar to that of Cochran and Teichner. Since Gn + 2  ⊂  Fn [\cite=COT03], we are able to adapt Cochran, Harvey and Leidy's technique [\cite=CHL07b] to prove that no non-trivial linear combination of these knots lies in Fn.5, hence not in Gn + 2.5.

We construct knots that bound smooth embeddings of gropes in D4. We state our main result so that is easy to read, but as stated, it is not the strongest possible assertion. The result of Cochran, Harvey and Leidy implies that no non-trivial linear combination of these knots is even topologically (n.5)-solvable, hence does not bound even a topologically flat embedding of a height n.5 grope in D4.

For the Grope filtration of the group of m-component string links with m > 1, Harvey showed in [\cite=sH08] that for all n, Gmn  /  Gmn + 2 contains an infinitely generated subgroup. Let [formula] denote the subgroup of Gmn whose elements are boundary links. Combining [\cite=sH08] and [\cite=CH08], it is known that for each m > 1 and n  ≥  2, the abelianization of [formula] has infinite rank. We improve the result by narrowing the index gap.

Definitions

If G is a group, the derived series of G is defined recursively by G(0) = G and [formula].

Let M be closed, connected, orientable 3-manifold. Recall from [\cite=COT03] the definition of an (n)-solution for M.

A smooth, spin 4-manifold W with ∂W = M is an (n)-solution for M if the inclusion-induced map [formula] is an isomorphism and if there are embedded surfaces Li and Di (with product neighborhoods) for [formula] that satisfy the following conditions:

the homology classes [formula] form an ordered basis for [formula],

the intersection form [formula] with respect to this ordered basis is a direct sum of hyperbolics,

[formula] is empty if i  ≠  j,

for each i, Li and Di intersect transversely at a point, and

each Li and Di are (n)-surfaces, i.e. [formula] and [formula].

If, in addition, [formula] for each i, we say W is an (n.5)-solution for M.

There is a slight generalization of n-solvability, called rational n-solvablility. For the purposes of this paper, it suffices to know that an n-solution is also a rational n-solution. If the above conditions hold except for the isomorphism on first homology, W is called an (n)-bordism for M.

If a closed, orientable 3-manifold bounds an (n)-solution, we say M is (n)-solvable. A knot K in S3 is said to be an (n)-solvable knot if 0-surgery on K is (n)-solvable.

As in [\cite=COT03], the set of all (n)-solvable knots is denoted Fn, where it was shown that these Fn filter the topological knot concordance group C, i.e. the Fn form a nested series of subgroups of C:

[formula]

The following definition is modified from the definition in [\cite=FT95]:

A grope is a special pair (2-complex, base circle). A grope has a height [formula]. A grope of height 1 is precisely a compact, oriented surface Σ with a single boundary component (the base circle). For [formula], a grope of height n + 1 is defined recursively as follows: let [formula] be a symplectic basis of curves for Σ, the first stage of the grope. Then a grope of height n + 1 is formed by attaching gropes of height n to each αi and βi along the base circles.

A grope of height 1.5 is formed by attaching gropes of height 1 (i.e. surfaces) to a Lagrangian of a symplectic basis of curves for Σ. That is, a grope of height 1.5 is a surface with surfaces glued to 'half' of the basis curves (i.e. the αi). In general, a grope of height n + 1.5 is obtained by attaching gropes of height n to the αi and gropes of height n + 1 to the βi.

Given a 4-manifold W with boundary M and a framed circle γ  ⊂  M, we say that γ bounds a Grope (note the capital 'G') in W if γ extends to a smooth embedding of a grope with its untwisted framing. That is, parallel push-offs of Gropes can be taken in W. Knots in S3 are always equipped with the zero framing.

Cochran, Orr, and Teichner [\cite=COT03] also defined the Grope filtration of C. The set of all knots that bound Gropes of height n in D4 is denoted Gn, which is a subgroup of C. Observe the following connection between gropes and the derived series: if a curve [formula] bounds a (map of a) grope of height n in a space X, then [formula]. It was shown in [\cite=COT03] that Gn + 2  ⊂  Fn (for all [formula]).

We will also use a few definitions from [\cite=CT07].

An annular grope of height n is a grope of height n that has an extra boundary component on its first stage. We say that the two boundary components of an annular grope cobound an annular grope. Two knots K0 and K1 are height n Grope concordant if they cobound a height n annular Grope G in S3  ×  [0,1] such that [formula] for i = 0,1. For example, if K is height n Grope concordant to a slice knot, then K∈Gn. The captial 'G' in 'annular Grope' indicates the untwisted framing.

Let G be a height n Grope in S3  ×  [0,1] bounded by a knot K  ⊂  S3  ×  {0}. The union of sets of basis curves for each n-th stage surface of G is called a set of tips for G. If the tips lie on annuli in S3  ×  [0,1] that are disjoint from each other and disjoint from the Grope (except at the tips) and the other boundary components of the annuli lie in S3  ×  {1}, we say 'the tips are isotopic' to the the link determined by the other boundary components of these annuli (a link in S3  ×  {1}).

A capped Grope is the union of a Grope and a disjoint union of discs where the boundaries of the discs form a full set of tips of the Grope. The interiors of these discs must not intersect the Grope except perhaps on one of the boundary components of the Grope's first stage. These discs are called the 'caps' of the Grope. For example, if K bounds a Grope, the caps are allowed to hit K.

The construction of our examples relies on a technique known as infection. Let R be a fixed knot or link and K be a fixed knot in S3. Suppose α is a simple closed curve in S3 - R such that α is itself the unknot. Some number m of strands of R pierce the disc bounded by α. Let R(α,K) denote the knot obtained by replacing the m trivial strands of R by m strands 'tied into the knot K.' See Figure [\ref=infection]. More precisely, one obtains R(α,K) by removing a regular neighborhood of α and gluing in S3 - K in such a way that identifies the meridian of α with the longitude of K and the longitude of α with the meridian of K. We say R(α,K) is the result of infecting R by K along α.

Let (H,J) denote the zero-framed, ordered Hopf link in the complement of a knot or link R in Figure [\ref=hopf]. Surgery on (H,J) is homeomorphic to S3 [\cite=rK78], so the image of R after performing this Hopf surgery is a new knot or link in S3. By sliding the strands of R (that pass through J) over H and cancelling the Hopf pair, one sees the effect of Hopf surgery in Figure [\ref=hopf]. We will use the terminology 'performing the handle cancellation J - H' to mean 'performing (H,J) Hopf surgery.' This convention matches [\cite=CT07].

Knots Bounding Gropes of Height n + 2

Fix an m  ≥  1. For each n  ≥  1, we will construct a knot Knm by infecting a seed knot R along certain curves in [formula] by a knot Kn - 1m. Roughly speaking, we construct a height n + 2 Grope bounded by Knm in two stages. First we prove each Kn - 1m bounds a height n + 1 Grope whose tips are isotopic to meridians of Kn - 1m. When we infect R by Kn - 1m, we will see that the tips of this Grope are isotopic to the infection curves, which we will then prove bound capped Gropes of height 1. Gluing these height 1 capped Gropes onto the tips of the height n + 1 Gropes for Kn - 1m (and gluing a few annuli and slice discs) will result in a height n + 2 Grope bounded by Knm.

The infecting knots Pm

Let Pm be the knot defined in Figure [\ref=Pm]. A priori, we have described Pm as a knot in some closed, oriented 3-manifold that is the image of U after performing 0-surgery on the (10 + 4m)-component link in Figure [\ref=Pm]. Using Kirby's calculus of framed links (see, for example, [\cite=GS99]), one can check that this 3-manifold is S3.

Each Pm cobounds with the unknot a height 2 annular Grope in in S3  ×  [0,1] whose tips are isotopic to a set of disjoint copies of meridians of Pm.

We claim that Figure [\ref=gropepicture] depicts a height 2 annular grope in S3 between Pm and U. Let L denote the (10 + 4m)-component link [formula] in Figure [\ref=firstgropepicture]; the link L is isotopic to the link defining Pm in Figure [\ref=Pm]. In Figure [\ref=firstgropepicture], we have shaded in some punctured surfaces bounded by the components H0, H4, and H9. Once we perform 0-surgery on L, these punctured surfaces will become closed surfaces, and these surfaces will be used to construct a height 2 Grope.

We perform 2m + 2 handle cancellations,

[formula]

to arrive at Figure [\ref=gropepicture] (ignore the U and shaded parts for now). What remains is a 6-component link N = (H0,H1,H2,H3,H4,H9). Let N' denote the link N - {H0,H1}; N' consists of two separated Hopf links, thus 0-surgery on N' (denoted S3N') is homeomorphic to S3. Let U be the knot in Figure [\ref=gropepicture] that deviates only slightly from Pm. The resulting knot U' after 0-surgery on N' is the unknot in [formula], since U does not hit the discs bounded by H1, H2 and H3.

There is a punctured annulus in S3 bounded by U and Pm; the lightest shade of grey in Figure [\ref=gropepicture] is part of this annulus. The other part of this annulus has been collapsed to simplify the diagram. To the puncture, glue one boundary component of a tube. Push this annulus over H1, and glue the other boundary component to the circle where H1 punctures the torus on which H0 lies (second darkest shade of grey in Figure [\ref=gropepicture]). So far we have a height 1 (and genus 1) annular grope between Pm and the unknot in S3.

One may take the obvious symplectic basis elements for the aforementioned torus, tube them over H2 and H3 and attach them to punctured the surfaces for H4 and H9 (the darkest shade of grey in Figure [\ref=gropepicture]). Recall that after zero surgery on the link, H4 and H9 lie on closed surfaces. Now we have a height 2 annular grope in S3 between Pm and the unknot. Figure [\ref=gropepicture] shows that the tips of this annular grope are isotopic to meridians of Pm.

One can push the U boundary of component of this annular grope in the positive I direction and the Pm boundary component in the negative I direction to arrive at the desired result.

The seed knot R and the infection curves

Our examples are inspired by Cochran, Harvey and Leidy's family Jn. They construct their family inductively by infecting the 946 knot along the curves α and β in Figure [\ref=infectingcurves]. Note that the obvious tori in S3 - 946 bounded by α and β intersect. For our construction of the Gropes for Knm, it is necessary that our infection curves bound disjoint surfaces in the complement of 946. We homotope α and β to arrive at different infection curves α' and β'.

Let R = 946. By Figure [\ref=curvesboundcappedtori], the curves α' and β' bound tori that are disjoint and that miss R. The torus bounded by α' has a symplectic basis x1,x2 (the curve x2 has been isotoped off of the torus) of curves that inherit the zero framing from the torus. The torus bounded by β' has a similar symplectic basis y1,y2. It is clear from Figure [\ref=curvesboundcappedtori] that the curves x1,x2,y1,y2 bound disjoint discs that hit the knot R transversely. Thus, α' and β' bound disjoint capped tori in the complement of R.

Knots bounding Gropes of height n + 2

We now describe our family of knots Knm for n,m  ≥  1 with the property that Knm∈Gn + 2. Recall R = 946, and α' and β' be from Figure [\ref=infectingcurves]. The curves α' and β' bound punctured tori that are disjointly embedded in S3 - R. Let K1m denote R infected along α' and β' by our knot Pm. Define Kn + 1m by infecting R along α' and β' by Knm. Observe that g(Knm)  ≤  3 since α' and β' miss a genus three Seifert surface for R.

Let R be a knot in S3, α an unknotted curve in S3 - R. If K and J are knots that are height n Grope concordant, then the results of infection R(α,K) and R(α,J) are height n Grope concordant.

The knots R(α,K) and R(α,J) differ by what happens inside a fixed ball D3:

Let (D3,m  K) denote the left-hand side of this diagram, i.e. a 3-ball with m arcs tied into K. Since K and J are height n Grope concordant, so are (D3,m  K) and (D3,m  J). We see this by slitting a height n Grope concordance from K to J, which turns it into a 'height n slit Grope concordance' from one knotted arc to another. Taking parallel copies of this slit Grope concordance in D3  ×  [0,1] yields G, the 'height n slit Grope concordance' in D3  ×  [0,1] from (D3,m  K)  ×  {0} to (D3,m  J)  ×  {1}. We simply glue this G to [formula] to arrive at a height n Grope concordance from R(α,K) to R(α,J).

Let R = 946 and K1m be defined as above. Then K1m is height 3 capped Grope concordant to R.

For simplicity, let K = K1m. K is R infected along α' and β' by Pm. We will first concentrate on the infection along the α' curve. Let K' denote R infected along α' by Pm. We will infect along β' later, arriving at K. Consider a diagram for the link R,α'. The knot K' can be described by replacing the infection curve with the framed (10 + 4m)-component link that defines Pm. Figure [\ref=infectionoperation] depicts this operation.

One may form a new knot L by pulling the 2 strands of K' out of the upper-right-most 0-framed curve in Figure [\ref=infectionoperation]. This is an '2-stranded analogue' of what is done in Figure [\ref=gropepicture]. As in Proposition [\ref=grope], there is a punctured annulus in S3 between K' and L (it is punctured twice). These punctures are 2 parallel copies of a meridian of the 0-framed curve through which we pulled the 2 strands of K'. Float these punctures downward in the I direction so that each puncture is in a different [formula] level. To each puncture, one can glue the height 2 Grope for Pm described in Proposition [\ref=grope]. As before, the tips of the Grope in the [formula] level are isotopic to parallel copies of the infection curve [formula]. Now, we may float each of these [formula] disjointly down to the S3  ×  {1} level. Since each of the pieces of the Grope (and the tips) miss K' and L, we may glue L  ×  [0,1] to this Grope. The result is a height 2 Grope concordance from K'  ×  {0} to L  ×  {1} whose tips are disjointly isotopic to parallel copies of α'  ×  {1}.

We claim that L is in fact R. The proof of this fact is similar to the proof that the U from Figure [\ref=gropepicture] and Proposition [\ref=grope] is the unknot. Namely, we have expressed L as surgery on separated Hopf links, and for each of these Hopf pairs, L does not pass through one of the components. Thus, performing the surgery does not change L locally, and away from the surgery link, L is identically R.

At this point we have proven K' = R(α',Pm) is height 2 Grope concordant to R, and the tips of this Grope concordance (which we name G) are isotopic to parallel copies of α'. We can view K as K'(β',Pm). An argument similar to the one above yields a height 2 Grope concordance (which we name H) between K and K' whose tips are isotopic to parallel copies of β'. We can glue H  ⊂  S3  ×  [0,1] to G  ⊂  S3  ×  [1,2] and float the tips of H down through S3  ×  [1,2] so that they miss G. In order to justify this, we recall from the proof of Proposition [\ref=heightngropeconcordinfection] that G was constructed by gluing pieces of R  ×  I (which miss β') to something that lived in D3  ×  I, where α'  ⊂  D3 and β' was contained in S3 - D3. Thus, [formula]. We see that [formula] is a height 2 Grope concordance between K1m and R with punctured caps, and these punctures are parallel copies of β' union parallel copies of α' such that the punctures lie in [formula]. The result is a height 2 Grope concordance between K = K1m and R whose tips are the union of parallel copies of α' and parallel copies of β'. A schematic of J is depicted in Figure [\ref=schematicofgrope], with n = 0. Pushing further down into S3  ×  [2,3], we can glue parallel copies of the capped tori to the copies α' and β'. The reader will recall that these capped tori miss R. Since we attached a capped torus to each tip of J, we are left with a height 3 capped Grope concordance between K1m and R, as desired.

For each n,m  ≥  1, Knm is height n + 2 capped Grope concordant to R = 946. In particular, Knm bounds a Grope of height n + 2 in D4.

We induct on n. The claim is true in the case n = 1 by Proposition [\ref=basecase]. Assume that the claim is true for Knm.

By definition Kn + 1m is R infected along α' and β' by Knm. As in the proof of Proposition [\ref=basecase], we first concentrate on the infection along α'. Let K' = R(α',Knm). By the inductive hypothesis on Knm and by Proposition [\ref=heightngropeconcordinfection], K' and R = R(α,) are height n + 2 Grope concordant. This Grope concordance is built using the height n + 2 capped Grope concordance L between Knm and R. Each cap of L hits R transversely, and removing neighborhoods of the intersection points from the cap yields a planar surface with boundary equal to a tip of L and copies of the meridian of R. The meridians of R can float along L to be meridians of Knm. Under the infection of R along α' by Knm, the meridian of Knm is identified with (the longitude of a regular neighborhood of) α'. Let G denote the union of L and these planar surfaces reaching out from the tips. By the 'punctures of G,' we mean the punctures of these punctured caps, each of which is a copy of α'.

As for the infection along α', between Kn + 1m = K'(β',Knm) and K' there is a height n + 2 Grope concordance H with punctured caps whose punctures are copies of β'. Since infecting along β' is a local operation near β', H misses α'  ×  [0,1].

We now describe the height n + 3 capped Grope concordance between Kn + 1m and R. Figure [\ref=schematicofgrope] shows a schematic of the ultimate Grope. We start with the height n + 2 Grope concordance H between Kn + 1m and K'. Imagine that H is embedded in S3  ×  [0,1] so that [formula] and [formula]. The punctures of H are parallel copies of β' in S3  ×  {1}. Now imagine that G, which is the Grope concordance between K' and R, is imbedded in S3  ×  [1,2] so that [formula] and [formula]. The punctures of G are parallel copies of α' in S3  ×  {2}. We claim that we can 'float down the punctures of H' into the S3  ×  {2} level while missing G. A justification of this was given in the proof of Proposition [\ref=basecase]. We see that [formula] is a height n + 2 Grope concordance between Kn + 1m and R with punctured caps, and these punctures are parallel copies of β' union parallel copies of α' such that the punctures lie in [formula].

Since α' and β' bound disjoint capped torus in S3 - R, we can glue parallel copies of the capped torus (in S3  ×  [2,3]) to J along the punctures of J. To summarize, we have attached capped surfaces to each tip in the height n + 2 Grope concordance J. What we have is a height n + 3 capped Grope concordance between Kn + 1m and R. We have proven the inductive step, and the claim is true for all n.

Algebraic Invariants

We outline a proof that Knm (or a subsequence of similar knots) are linearly independent in Gn + 2  /  Gn + 2.5. The following arguments are adapted from Cochran, Harvey and Leidy's proof that Fn  /  Fn.5 has infinite rank (cf. [\cite=CHL07b]).

Let K be a knot in S3 and [formula]. The real number ρ1(K) is the first-order L(2)-signature given by the Cheeger-Gromov invariant [formula].

For n  ≥  0, Gn + 2  /  Gn + 2.5 has infinite rank.

We produce an infinite family of knots in Gn + 2 whose members are linearly independent in Gn + 2  /  Gn + 2.5. This family is a subsequence of {Knm}∞m = 1, or possibly a subsequence of a related family (see the proof below for a discussion). To avoid unnecessary reproduction of previous results, we will give a brief outline of the proof and refer the reader to [\cite=CHL07b] for the details. We merely push through the proof given by Cochran, Harvey and Leidy in [\cite=CHL07b], just to verify that their argument may be used to show that no non-trivial linear combination of the Knm lie in Fn.5, hence not in Gn + 2.5.

First, we must find a genus one ribbon knot R with ρ1(R)  ≠  0. If ρ1(946)  ≠  0, we can set R = 946. Otherwise, we can tie one band of 946 into the right-handed trefoil knot, as shown in Figure [\ref=addtrefoil]; the result, R, is a ribbon knot with ρ1(R)  ≠  0.

Second, we must find an infinite set P of knots Pm such that no non-trivial rational linear combination of [formula] is a rational multiple of ρ1(R). These ρ0 invariants are discussed in Lemma [\ref=indepsigs]. Lemma [\ref=indepsigs] provides an infinite subset of the knots Pm defined in Section [\ref=infectingknots] that satisfy this property.

For each n  ≥  0, we define a family of knots [formula]. This family is defined as in Section [\ref=ourexamples], except using the knot R as the seed knot. It should be noted that (possibly) having tied a trefoil in one of the bands does not affect the conclusions of any of the results in Section [\ref=highgropes]. In particular, these Knm lie in Gn + 2.

Now we must prove that no non-trivial linear combination of the knots Knm is (even rationally) (n.5)-solvable. Since Gn + 2.5  ⊂  Fn.5, it will follow that no such combination of these knots lies in Gn + 2.5, hence these knots are linearly independent in Gn + 2  /  Gn + 2.5. Suppose that a finite sum [formula] is rationally (n.5)-solvable. We may assume that j1  ≥  0. We construct a faimly of 4-manifolds Wi and reach a contradiction. Let us abbreviate MKnm = Mnm.

Consider Wn with boundary [formula]. Recall that M01 = MK01 = MP1. Let [formula] and consider φ:π  →  π  /  π(n + 1)r. Then by property (3) of Proposition [\ref=chlprop],

[formula]

where C1  ≥  0 and φR:π1(MR)  →  π  /  π(n + 1)r is induced by inclusion (and similarly for φα' and φβ'). By property (2) of Proposition[\ref=chlprop], [formula], implying that the restrictions φα' and φβ' factor through the respective abelianizations. Additionally by property (2), at least one of these coefficient systems is non-trivial. Hence, by Proposition [\ref=chlprop],

[formula]

where ε is equal to one or two. Thus we can simplify equation [\ref=theequation] to yield

[formula]

where ε + C1  ≥  1. Also by property (2) of Proposition [\ref=chlprop],

[formula]

so φR factors through G / G(2) where [formula]. Since ker (φR)  ⊂  G(1), φR is determined by the kernel, denoted A, of the induced map

[formula]

A is a submodule of the Alexander module G(1) / G(2). Since the Alexander polynomial of R is (2t - 1)(t - 2), the product of two irreducible coprime factors, the Alexander module of R has only four submodules: the trivial submodule, A itself, and 〈α'〉 and 〈β'〉. One can examine these four possibilities for A and conclude that [formula]. Combining this with equation [\ref=theequation2], we have

[formula]

where C0∈{0,1}. Since ε + C1  ≥  1, we have written a multiple of ρ1(R) as a non-trivial linear combination of [formula], a contradiction.

(Proposition 8.2 of [\cite=CHL07b]). If [formula] is rationally (n.5)-solvable, then for each 0  ≤  i  ≤  n, there is a 4-manifold Wi with the following properties. Let π  =  π1(Wi).

Wi is a rational (n)-bordism where, for i < n, ∂Wi = Mn1 and [formula],

under the inclusion(s) j:Mn - i1  ⊂  ∂Wi  →  Wi,

[formula]

and for each i (at least one of the copies of) Mn - i1  ⊂  ∂Wi,

[formula]

and under the inclusion j:MR  ⊂  ∂Wn  →  Wn,

[formula]

for any PTFA coefficient system [formula] with Γ(n + 1)r = 1,

[formula]

for some integers Cm (depending on φ) with C1  ≥  0.

We refer the reader to [\cite=CHL07b] for a proof of this proposition.

String links

We follow the notation of [\cite=sH08]. Let C(m) denote the group of m-component string links modulo concordance (the group operation is concatenation). If L∈C(m), let L̂ denote the closure of L; L̂ is obtained by attaching the m-component trivial link to the ends of L in the obvious way. Let Gmn denote the subset of C(m) defined by L∈Gmn if the components of L̂ bound disjoint Gropes of height n in D4. It can be shown that the Grope filtration of C(m)

[formula]

is a filtration of C(m) by normal subgroups. If B(m) denotes the sugroup of C(m) consisting of boundary string links, we define [formula].

There is also the (n)-solvable filtration of C(m), whose definition we omit, that is related to the Grope filtration by Gmn + 2  ⊂  Fmn for all [formula]. Let [formula].

For each [formula], Harvey [\cite=sH08] defined a link invariant [formula]. The salient features of this ρn are listed below:

[\cite=sH08] For each n  ≥  0 and m  ≥  1, [formula] is a homomorphism,

[\cite=CH08] ρn(L) vanishes for all [formula].

[\cite=sH08] If T is the identity element of B(m), η an unknotted circle in the complement of T that lies in [formula], and T(η,K) denotes T infected along η by the knot K, then ρn(T(η,K)) = ρ0(K), where ρ0(K) is the classical signature discussed in Lemma [\ref=indepsigs].

Harvey proved that the Grope filtration of the string link concordance group is a non-trivial filtration.

For each n  ≥  1 and m  ≥  2, the abelianization of [formula] has infinite rank; hence [formula] is an infinitely generated subgroup of Gmn  /  Gmn + 1.5.

With our knots Pm∈G2, we are able to close the index gap.

For each n  ≥  2 and m  ≥  2, the abelianization of [formula] has infinite rank; hence [formula] is an infinitely generated subgroup of Gmn  /  Gmn + .5.

For n = 2, let Lk denote the m-component boundary string link whose closure is the union of the (m - 1)-component trivial link and the knot Pk as defined in Section [\ref=infectingknots]. Since Pk∈G2, the components of the closure of Lk bound disjoint Gropes of height 2, m - 1 of which are discs. Thus [formula]. The linear independence of the Lk in [formula] follows from the argument below when n  ≥  3.

Assume n  ≥  1. We prove the statement for n + 2. Let F denote the free group on m generators, and T be the trivial m-component string link, so that [formula]. Pick an element ∈F(n) - F(n + 1). By [\cite=CT07], we may pick an embedded curve η in D2  ×  I  -  T that bounds a disk in D2  ×  I and that bounds a Grope of height n in D2  ×  I  -  T. Let Sη  =  {T(η,Pk): Pk} where T(η,K) is defined by item 3 of Remark [\ref=salfeat]. Since η∈F(1), there are disjoint surfaces bounded by the components of T that miss the curve η. Thus each L∈Sη is a boundary string link. Since Pk∈G2, we have that if L∈Sη, then L̂∈Gmn + 2. Thus, [formula].

By items 1 and 2 of Remark [\ref=salfeat], [formula] is a well-defined homomorphism. By item 3 of Remark [\ref=salfeat], the image of Sη under this homomorphism is [formula], which contains a [formula]-linearly independent subset of [formula] by Lemma [\ref=indepsigs]. The conclusion follows.

Caclulation of ρ-invariants

We now calculate the classical signatures of the Pm and discuss why they are linearly independent.

The 0-th-order signature of Pm is given by [formula] where θm is the number satisfying [formula] and 0 < θm  <  π.

Let Em denote the exterior of Pm. Recall that Pm is defined by surgery on the link in Figures [\ref=Pm] and [\ref=firstgropepicture]. Depicted in Figure [\ref=intermediate] is that link, isotoped for convenience.

After performing the handle cancellations

[formula]

we arrive at the link in Figure [\ref=alexmodulecalc1]. Thus, we can describe Em as the image of S3 - U after 0-surgery on the two component link {H9,H2} as in Figure [\ref=alexmodulecalc1]. This link is the result after performing 0-surgery on all components of the link in Figure [\ref=Pm] except for the bottom-most two. As discussed in the proof of Proposition [\ref=grope], the link {H9,H2} is a link in S3.

As in [\cite=dR76], we can compute the Alexander module of Em using these surgery instructions. Let α denote a lift of H9 in the infinite cyclic cover of U, and let β denote the lift of H2 that links α once. Let τ denote a generator of the group of covering translations. Recall that the matrix

[formula]

where [formula] equals the framing of H9 and [formula] equals the framing of H2, is a presentation matrix for the Alexander module of Em.

Displayed in Figure [\ref=alexmodulecalc2] is the link {U,H9,H2} after an isotopy. Figure [\ref=alexmodulecalc3] depicts the infinite cyclic cover of Em.

From Figure [\ref=alexmodulecalc3], one computes the Alexander matrix to be

[formula]

The Alexander polynomial of Pm is

[formula]

Recall that ρ0 of a knot is equal to the integral of the Levine-Tristram signature function over the unit circle (normalized to have length one), and that this function is constant away from the roots of the Alexander polynomial. We claim that the polynomial Δm(t) has exactly two roots on the unit circle, namely e±  iθm, where [formula] and 0 < θm  <  π. After proving this claim, we can conclude the signature of λ is + 2 when substituting t =  - 1, thus [formula].

It is easy to verify that e±  iθm are roots of Δm(t) and that Δm(t) factors as

[formula]

Assume that eiψ, where [formula], is a root of the second factor in Equation ([\ref=alexfactor]). Then ψ must satisfy the equation

[formula]

The quadratic formula yields [formula]. This implies that [formula], and we conclude that Δm(t) has no other roots on the unit circle.

There is a subsequence of Pmj of the knots Pm whose set of 0-th-order signatures is linearly independent over [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=sigcalc], it is sufficient to find a set {θmj}∞j = 1 that is linearly independent over [formula]. Let [formula] be a sequence of prime integers satisfying [formula] for all j, and set [formula]. It was shown in [\cite=COT04] that {θmj}∞j = 1 is linearly independent over [formula].
