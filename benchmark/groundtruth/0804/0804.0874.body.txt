A class of solutions of the vacuum Einstein constraint equations with freely specified mean curvature

A class of solutions of the vacuum Einstein constraint equations with freely specified mean curvature

Introduction

The Cauchy problem of general relativity requires initial data (a metric and a second fundamental form defined on a 3-manifold) that satisfy a system of nonlinear PDEs known as the Einstein constraint equations. The constraint equations admit many solutions (permitting the specification of different initial conditions) and it is important to understand the structure of the set of all possible initial data on a given manifold. Various approaches have been given for constructing solutions including parabolic methods [\cite=BartnikQS] and gluing constructions [\cite=corvino] [\cite=InitialDataEngineering]. From the point of view of classifying the set of all possible solutions, the most fruitful technique has been the conformal method initiated by Lichnerowicz [\cite=lich-conformal] and extended by Choquet-Bruhat and York [\cite=cb-york-held].

In the conformal method, one specifies the conformal class of the initial metric, a piece of the second fundamental form corresponding to part of the time derivative of the conformal class, and the trace of the second fundamental form (i.e. the mean curvature). One then seeks a solution of the constraint equations matching this data. For constant mean curvature (CMC) data, this approach has lead to a complete classification of solutions on compact [\cite=cb-york-held] [\cite=const-compact], asymptotically Euclidean [\cite=cantor-cond] [\cite=lap-asympt-flat] (with a correction in [\cite=maxwell-ahc]), and asymptotically hyperbolic [\cite=Anderssonetal92] [\cite=Anderssonetal96] manifolds. On the other hand, we have very few results concerning non-CMC solutions, and most of these are perturbative. Near-CMC solutions have been constructed on compact [\cite=BruhatEtAl92] [\cite=const-non-cmc-compact] [\cite=Isenbergetal07] [\cite=Holstetal07] and asymptotically Euclidean [\cite=BruhatAH] [\cite=const-asympt-flat] manifolds, and we have a near-CMC non-existence theorem for certain data [\cite=IsenbergOMurch04]. It is remarkable, however, that despite the success of the conformal method in the CMC case, very little is known about the construction of solutions in the absence of restrictions on the mean curvature.

An important recent result of Holst, Nagy, and Tsogtgerel [\cite=Holstetal07] (see also the summary in [\cite=Holstetal08]) gives the first construction, using the conformal method, of a class of initial data without a near-CMC hypothesis. The authors of that paper show that solutions of the constraint equations on compact manifolds can be constructed using the conformal method when global sub- and supersolutions (defined in Section [\ref=sec:conformal]) can be found. For Yamabe-positive metrics, for non-vanishing matter fields, and under a certain smallness condition not involving the mean curvature, [\cite=Holstetal07] provides a global subsolution/supersolution pair that does not have a near-CMC hypothesis and hence yields the existence of certain far-from-CMC solutions.

It is natural to ask if this far-from-CMC construction can be extended to the vacuum case. The global supersolution of [\cite=Holstetal07] (hereafter the HNT global supersolution) is also applicable in vacuum, and indeed requires that the matter fields, if present, be weak. The corresponding HNT global subsolution, however, requires the presence of matter. It is not unusual for the conformal method to require non-vanishing conditions on parts of the specified data, so it was conceivable that the non-vacuum hypothesis was necessary.

In this paper we show that this is not the case, and that the conformal method can be used to construct a corresponding set of vacuum solutions. We give two proofs of this fact. First, we prove that solutions exist, under certain mild technical conditions, whenever a global supersolution can be found (Theorem [\ref=thm:main]). The proof relies on an a-priori estimate (Proposition [\ref=prop:yposlow]) that replaces the need for a global subsolution. Hence the HNT global supersolution alone is sufficient to deduce the existence of solutions via the conformal method, and we obtain vacuum far-from-CMC solutions. The second proof considers a sequence of HNT non-vacuum solutions where the matter fields are converging to zero. Again, a lower bound (Proposition [\ref=prop:seqlow]) is found for the sequence and is used to obtain a corresponding subsequence converging to a vacuum far-from-CMC solutions. The key steps in both proofs rely on a technique from [\cite=Maxwell05] for constructing subsolutions.

The conformal method

On a given smooth 3-manifold M, the Einstein constraint equations for a metric [formula] and a symmetric (0,2)-tensor q are

[formula]

where [formula] is the scalar curvature of [formula], [formula] is the matter density, and [formula] is the momentum density. We are primarily interested in the vacuum case where [formula] and [formula].

Data for the vacuum conformal method on a compact smooth manifold M consists of a Riemannian metric g specifying a conformal class, a transverse traceless (i.e symmetric, trace-free and divergence-free) (0,2)-tensor σ specifying part of the time derivative of the conformal class, and a scalar function τ specifying the mean curvature. We seek a solution (,q) of the constraint equations of the form

[formula]

In equations [\eqref=reconst] the unknowns are a positive function φ and a vector field W, while [formula] is the conformal Killing operator defined by

[formula]

If matter is present, it can be specified by scaled sources ρ and J which are conformally related to [formula] and [formula] by   =  φ- 8ρ and   =  φ- 6J.

It follows that [formula] and q solve the vacuum constraint equations so long as

[formula]

If matter is present we must add the terms 2ρφ- 3 and J to the right-hand sides of [\eqref=sys-lich] and [\eqref=sys-momentum] respectively. The operator [formula] is the vector Laplacian, and hence these equations are a coupled nonlinear elliptic system for φ and W.

If τ is constant then equation [\eqref=sys-momentum] has a trivial solution and the problem reduces to an analysis of the Lichnerowicz equation [\eqref=sys-lich]. One technique for finding solutions of the Lichnerowicz equation is via the method of sub- and supersolutions, which was used previously in the work of Kazden and Warner [\cite=KazdanWarner75] on the prescribed scalar curvature problem. Isenberg [\cite=const-compact] used this method to complete the classification of CMC solutions on compact manifolds. A generalization of the method applies in the non-CMC setting as well, and we review the terminology now.

Consider the equation

[formula]

where β is a symmetric (0,2)-tensor. We say φ+ is a supersolution of [\eqref=lichfirst] if

[formula]

A subsolution is defined similarly with the inequality reversed.

For the coupled system, we follow [\cite=Holstetal07] and define global subsolutions and global supersolutions as follows. Given a function φ, let Wφ be the corresponding solution of [\eqref=sys-momentum]. We say φ+ is a global supersolution if whenever 0 < φ  ≤  φ+, then

[formula]

We say φ- > 0 is a global subsolution if whenever φ  ≥  φ-, then

[formula]

The existence result of [\cite=Holstetal07] states that if φ-  ≤  φ+ are global sub- and supersolutions, then there exists a solution (φ,W) of system [\eqref=sys-lich]-[\eqref=sys-momentum] such that φ-  ≤  φ  ≤  φ+. The authors of that paper also present a number of global sub- and supersolution pairs, including one that is used to construct far-from-CMC solutions.

Summary of results

Our primary result concerning the solution of system [\eqref=sys-lich]-[\eqref=sys-momentum] has three cases depending on the Yamabe invariant Yg of the metric. Recall that

[formula]

(Our notation for Lp spaces and Sobolev spaces Wk,p follows that of [\cite=yamabe-problem] with the additional convention that subspaces of positive functions are indicated by a subscript +  .)

Let g∈W2,p with p > 3 be a metric on a smooth, compact 3-manifold. Suppose g has no conformal Killing fields and that one of the following conditions holds for a transverse traceless tensor σ∈W1,p and a function τ∈W1,p.

Yg > 0, [formula],

Yg = 0, [formula], [formula]

Yg  <  0 and there exists ĝ in the conformal class of g such that [formula].

If φ+∈W2,p+ is a global supersolution for (g,σ,τ), then there exists a solution (φ,W)∈W2,p+  ×  W2,p of system [\eqref=sys-lich]-[\eqref=sys-momentum] such that φ  ≤  φ+.

The new results of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] are Cases 1 and 2; Case 3 can be deduced from the existence of a global subsolution found in [\cite=Holstetal07]. Note that Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is only an existence theorem. It is not known if the solutions provided by Theorem [\ref=thm:main] are unique.

If τ is constant then the conditions of the three cases reduce to precisely the same conditions under which CMC solutions of the constraints can be found (aside from one additional singular case Yg = 0, [formula], [formula]). The hypothesis on τ in Case 3 is necessary for Yamabe-negative metrics since it is needed for solutions of the Lichneowicz equation to exist [\cite=Maxwell05]. It is not known if the condition [formula] in Cases 1-2 is necessary. However, it was proved in [\cite=IsenbergOMurch04] that if Yg  ≥  0 and if [formula], then there do not exist near-CMC solutions of [\eqref=sys-lich]-[\eqref=sys-momentum] unless Yg = 0 and [formula] also. Hence some condition involving σ (and possibly also τ) must be required. The hypothesis in Case 2 that [formula] (if [formula]) can be shown to be necessary - otherwise the metric would be be Yamabe-positive.

Our first application of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is to the HNT supersolution, which exists under the following hypotheses.

Suppose g∈W2,p with p > 3, and that Yg > 0, τ∈W1,p, and σ∈W1,p. If  ||σ||∞ is sufficiently small, then there exists a global supersolution of [\eqref=sys-lich]-[\eqref=sys-momentum].

A proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:HNTsuper] can be found in Section [\ref=sec:mapping]. From Theorem [\ref=thm:main] and Proposition [\ref=prop:HNTsuper] we immediately obtain the following result, which is the primary aim of this paper.

Let g∈W2,p with p > 3 be a Yamabe-positive metric on a smooth compact 3-manifold. Suppose g has no conformal Killing fields, σ∈W1,p is a transverse traceless tensor, and τ∈W1,p. If [formula] and if  ||σ||∞ is sufficiently small, then there exists a solution (φ,W)∈W2,p+  ×  W2,p of system [\eqref=sys-lich]-[\eqref=sys-momentum].

We also provide a second proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:nonvac] in Section [\ref=sec:sequence] that is independent of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] but instead uses a sequence of HNT non-vacuum solutions.

Theorem [\ref=thm:main] permits a strengthening of the current existence theory for near-CMC data inasmuch as it removes conditions in current theorems required to find subsolutions. In [\cite=Isenbergetal07] the authors present an existence and uniqueness theorem for Yamabe non-negative metrics. They present constant global supersolutions so long as

[formula]

and also assume non-scale invariant conditions on the size of [formula] to obtain subsolutions and to obtain uniqueness. Previously [\cite=const-non-cmc-compact] gave a similar proof for Yamabe-negative metrics, again presenting a global supersolution under condition [\eqref=smallmc] and making an additional assumption about the absolute size of [formula]. [\cite=Holstetal07] provides a global supersolution under a near-CMC condition similar to [\eqref=smallmc], but also requires in the Yamabe-nonnegative case either a non-vacuum hypothesis or that [formula] is sufficiently large to obtain a subsolution. Using Theorem [\ref=thm:main] we have the following simplified existence result.

Let the conditions of one of the cases of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] hold. If

[formula]

is sufficiently small, then there exists a solution (φ,W) of system [\eqref=sys-lich]-[\eqref=sys-momentum].

The utility of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is limited to cases where a global supersolution can be found. It is not known if the converse of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is true; in particular, given a solution of system [\eqref=sys-lich]-[\eqref=sys-momentum] it is not known if there also exists a corresponding global supersolution. Nevertheless, Theorem [\ref=thm:main] makes clear that any future advances in the existence theory of non-CMC initial data using the method of sub- and supersolutions need only focus on supersolutions.

In the following, Sections [\ref=sec:lich] and [\ref=sec:momentum] provide a summary of the basic results we require in the analysis of equations [\eqref=sys-lich] and [\eqref=sys-momentum] respectively. Section [\ref=sec:coupled] is devoted to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main], which is obtained using the Schauder fixed point theorem in an approach similar to one outlined in [\cite=Holstetal07]. The key step in Section [\ref=sec:coupled] is Proposition [\ref=prop:yposlow] which eliminates the need for a subsolution. Section [\ref=sec:sequence] provides the alternative proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:nonvac] using a sequence of non-vacuum solutions.

The Lichnerowicz operator

In this section we consider properties of the map taking (0,2)-tensors β and scalar functions τ to a solution φ of the Lichnerowicz equation

[formula]

The solvability of this equation has been considered in several works under various hypotheses on the zeros of β and τ as well as the Yamabe class of g. Building on previous work in [\cite=const-compact] and [\cite=cb-low-reg], a complete description of solvability of this equation on compact manifolds, including the Yamabe negative case, appeared in [\cite=Maxwell05]. In the context of the function spaces used in the current paper we have the following classification.

Suppose β,τ∈L2p and g∈W2,p where p > 3. Then there exists a positive solution φ∈W2,p+ of [\eqref=lich] if and only if one of the following is true.

Yg  >  0 and [formula],

Yg  =  0 and [formula], [formula],

Yg  <  0 and there exists ĝ in the conformal class of g such that [formula],

Yg  =  0, [formula], [formula].

In Cases 1-3 the solution is unique. In Case 4 any two solutions are related by scaling by a constant multiple.

In [\cite=Maxwell05], Proposition [\ref=prop:lichsolve] was proved under low regularity assumptions on the conformal data. In this paper we work for convenience with metrics in W2,p with p > 3. This level of regularity ensures that the metric is C1,α. The corresponding hypothesis in Proposition [\ref=prop:lichsolve] that β,τ∈L2p arises to ensure that the solution φ∈W2,p and is related to the fact that [formula] is an isomorphism if V∈Lp, V  ≥  0, and [formula] (see, e.g, [\cite=cb-low-reg]). We will later make the stronger assumption that σ,τ∈W1,p when working with the coupled system.

We are primarily interested in the map that, for fixed τ, takes β to a solution of equation [\eqref=lich]. We say that g and τ are Lichnerowicz compatible if they satisfy one of the conditions of Cases 1-3 and we say that β is admissible if it further satisfies the same condition. We will not need to consider the singular Case 4, which has no bearing on the construction of non-CMC solutions.

If g and τ are Lichnerowicz compatible, we define the Lichnerowicz operator [formula] to be the map taking β to the unique solution of [\eqref=lich]. Proposition [\ref=prop:lichsolve] effectively describes the domain of [formula] as an open subset Dτ of L2p: [formula] if Yg  ≥  0 and Dτ = L2p if Yg < 0.

Sub- and supersolutions

The existence of solutions in Cases 1-3 of Proposition [\ref=prop:lichsolve] follows from the method of sub- and supersolutions In the context of the function spaces used in this paper we have the following propositions, which can be deduced, e.g., from the results for less regular metrics in [\cite=Maxwell05].

If g∈W2,p and τ∈L2p are Lichnerowicz compatible and if β∈L2p is admissible, then there exist a subsolution φ- and a supersolution φ+ of [\eqref=lich] such that φ-  ≤  φ+.

Suppose g∈W2,p and β,τ∈L2p for some p > n. If φ-, φ+∈W2,p are a subsolution and a supersolution respectively of [\eqref=lich] such that φ-  ≤  φ+, then there exists a solution φ∈W2,p(M) of [\eqref=lich] such that φ-  ≤  φ  ≤  φ+.

An important technical tool used in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:lichsolve] is the well-known conformal covariance of [\eqref=lich], which allows us to pick a convenient conformal representative for g. This covariance can be expressed in terms of sub- and supersolutions.

Suppose g∈W2,p and β,τ∈L2p for some p > 3. Suppose also that ψ∈W2,p+. Define

[formula]

Then φ is a supersolution (resp. subsolution) of [\eqref=lich] if and only if   =  ψ- 1φ is a supersolution (resp. subsolution) of the conformally transformed equation

[formula]

In particular, φ is a solution of [\eqref=lich] if and only if ψ- 1φ is a solution of [\eqref=lichconf].

Let g' = φ4g, and let Rg' be its scalar curvature. Then it is well known that

[formula]

But g' = (ψ- 1φ)4ĝ, so

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

[formula]

The result now follows noting that ψ- 5 > 0 everywhere.

Proposition [\ref=prop:subsup] requires that φ-  ≤  φ+. This never poses a problem in practice, however, since we can always rescale sub- and supersolutions of [\eqref=lich] to obtain this inequality.

If φ+ is a supersolution of [\eqref=lich], then for any α  ≥  1, αφ+ is also a supersolution. If φ- is a subsolution of [\eqref=lich], then for any α  ≤  1, αφ- is also a subsolution.

We employ the monotonicity of the terms on the right-hand side of [\eqref=lich]. Note that for α  ≥  1,

[formula]

Hence αφ+ is a supersolution. The argument for subsolutions is similar.

An immediate application of Lemma [\ref=lem:scalesubsup] (and uniqueness of solutions of [\eqref=lich] for Lichnerowicz compatible data) is the fact that any supersolution at all of [\eqref=lich] provides an upper bound for solutions.

Suppose g∈W2,p and τ∈L2p are Lichnerowicz compatible and β∈L2p is admissible. If φ+∈W2,p+ is a positive supersolution of [\eqref=lich], then [formula]. An analagous result holds for subsolutions.

Suppose φ+ is a given supersolution and let φ- be the subsolution from Proposition [\ref=prop:bariers]. Pick α  ≤  1 such that αφ-  ≤  φ+ everywhere. For example we can take

[formula]

Then Proposition [\ref=prop:subsup] implies there exists a solution [formula] of [\eqref=lich] satisfying φ-  ≤    ≤  φ+. Since solutions of [\eqref=lich] for Lichnerowicz compatible data are unique, we conclude that   =  φ and therefore φ  ≤  φ+.

The vector Laplacian

The vector Laplacian [formula] is well known to be elliptic and its kernel consists of the conformal Killing fields of g. Hence the equation

[formula]

is solvable if and only if [formula] for every conformal killing field Z. In the context of the function spaces used in this paper, we have the following standard existence result (see, e.g., [\cite=cb-low-reg]).

Suppose g∈W2,p with p > 3 has no conformal Killing fields. Given X∈Lp there exists a unique solution W of

[formula]

Moreover, there is a constant c independent of X such that

[formula]

The hypothesis that (M,g) has no conformal Killing fields is superfluous. For smooth metrics, [\cite=IsenbergOMurch04] proved that a similar existence theorem and estimate follows even in the presence of conformal Killing fields, so long as we take X to be L2 orthogonal to the subspace of conformal Killing fields. Our construction of non-CMC solutions in this paper requires solvability of equation [\eqref=eq:vl] in general, however, and we must therefore assume that g has no conformal Killing fields. It is a curious fact that all current non-CMC existence theorems require the hypothesis that g does not have any conformal Killing fields, whereas this hypothesis is not required in the CMC case.

For a scalar field τ in W1,p with p > n, define [formula] by

[formula]

where W is the solution of

[formula]

We have the following standard estimate from [\cite=const-non-cmc-compact]; a stronger version that applies even in the case where g has conformal Killing fields can be found in [\cite=IsenbergOMurch04].

Let τ∈W1,p with p > 3. Then there exists a constant Kτ such that

[formula]

for every φ∈L∞.

From the Sobolev embedding [formula] and inequality [\eqref=vlcont] we have for various constants ck independent of φ and τ,

[formula]

Taking Kτ = c4||τ||W1,p completes the proof.

Existence of solutions of the coupled system

The standard approach to finding solutions of the coupled system [\eqref=sys-lich]-[\eqref=sys-momentum] is via a fixed point argument. In [\cite=const-non-cmc-compact] and [\cite=Isenbergetal07] the authors use the contraction mapping principle to find a (unique) fixed point. Topological methods have also been used to find fixed points, e.g. Leray-Schauder theory in [\cite=BruhatEtAl92] and the Schauder fixed point theorem in [\cite=Holstetal07]. These methods require weaker hypotheses but do not ensure uniqueness. Our existence theorem uses the Schauder fixed point theorem and is closely related to the approach of [\cite=Holstetal07] (although the specific map we find a fixed point for is different). In particular, we also do not obtain a proof of uniqueness.

In this section we assume that g∈W2,p and τ∈W1,p (with p > 3) are Lichnerowicz compatable and that σ∈W1,p is admissible (i.e. [formula] if Yg  ≥  0). This is exactly the hypothesis that g, τ, and σ satisfy one of Cases 1-3 of Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Define [formula] by

[formula]

To ensure [formula] is well defined, we assume that g has no conformal Killing fields (so that the domain of [formula] is all of L∞). We must must also verify that [formula] belongs to the domain of [formula] for any choice of φ∈L∞+. It suffices to show that if Yg  ≥  0, then [formula]. However, letting [formula] we have

[formula]

since [formula] if Yg  ≥  0.

The solutions of system [\eqref=sys-lich]-[\eqref=sys-momentum] for conformal data σ and τ are in one-to-one correspondence with the fixed points of [formula]. We will find fixed points of [formula] via an application of the Schauder fixed point theorem, which states that if f:U  →  U is a continuous map from a closed convex subset U of a normed space to itself, and if [formula] is compact, then f has a fixed point [\cite=Bollobas].

In Section [\ref=sec:invariant] we show that if φ+ is a global supersolution, then there is a constant K0 > 0 such that the set U = {φ∈L∞:K0  ≤  φ  ≤  φ+} is invariant under [formula]. Clearly U is closed and convex in L∞. In Section [\ref=sec:mapping] we show that [formula] is precompact in L∞ and that [formula] is continuous, which establishes Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

An invariant set for [formula]

Let φ+∈W2,p+ be a global supersolution. We seek an invariant set of the form {φ∈L∞:K0  ≤  φ  ≤  φ+ where K0 > 0 is a constant. To begin, it is easy to show that {φ∈L∞:0 < φ  ≤  φ+} is invariant under [formula].

If φ∈L∞+ satisfies φ  ≤  φ+, then

[formula]

Let [formula], so ψ is a solution of

[formula]

where [formula]. Since φ+ is a global supersolution and since 0  ≤  φ  ≤  φ+, we conclude that φ+ is a supersolution of [\eqref=lichW]. Lemma [\ref=lem:superbound] then implies ψ  ≤  φ+.

To find the lower bound K0 for the invariant set we consider the cases Yg  ≥  0 and Yg  <  0 separately. For the case Yg  ≥  0 an estimate for a lower bound for [formula] can be obtained from a lower bound for the Green's function of a certain elliptic PDE.

Let V∈Lp with p > 3 and suppose V  ≥  0, [formula]. Then Green's function G(x,y) of the operator [formula] exists and satisfies

[formula]

for some constant mG > 0.

Let H(x,y) be a positive Green's function for the Laplacian on M, so

[formula]

The existence of this Green's function and its properties are established in [\cite=aubin] in the case of smooth metrics; the same techniques apply to C1,α metrics and hence W2,p metrics if p > 3. In particular,

[formula]

where, since dim (M) = 3, h(x,y) is continuous on M  ×  M.

For fixed x, H(x,  ·  )∈L3 - ε for any ε > 0. Since V∈Lp for some p > 3, we conclude that H(x,  ·  )V(  ·  )∈Lr where

[formula]

for ε sufficiently small. That is, H(x,  ·  )V(  ·  )∈Lr with r > 3 / 2.

Let Ψ(x,y) be the solution of

[formula]

The solution exists and belongs to W2,r since H(x,  ·  )V(  ·  )∈Lr with r > 3 / 2 [\cite=cb-low-reg]. In particular, for fixed x, Sobolev embedding implies Ψ(x,y) is continuous in y. Moreover, the map taking x to H(x,  ·  ) is easily seen to be continuous as a map from M to L3 - ε and hence the map taking x to V(  ·  )H(x,  ·  ) is continuous from M to Lr. It follows that Ψ(x,y) is continuous in both x and y.

Define G(x,y) = H(x,y) + Ψ(x,y). Clearly G(x,y) is the Green's function for [formula]. We now show that G is uniformly bounded below by a positive number. Note that the asymptotic structure of G implies that G(x,y)  ≥  1 in in a neighborhood U of the diagonal in M  ×  M. Since G is continuous on [formula], it follows that it achieves a minimum on [formula] at a point (x0,y0). Take ε so small that G(x0,y)  ≥  1 on Bε(x0). Then on [formula] we have

[formula]

and G(x0,y)  ≥  1 on ∂Bε(x0). The strong maximum principle of [\cite=trudinger-measurable] (or [\cite=epde] Theorem 8.19 if V∈L∞) then applies and G(x0,y0) > 0. Setting mG  =   min (1,G(x0,y0)) completes the proof.

The estimate for the lower bound of G(x,y) implies an estimate for the lower bound of the solution of [formula] whenever f is non-negative.

Let V∈Lp with p > 3 and suppose V  ≥  0, [formula]. There exist positive constants c1 and c2 such that for every f∈Lp with f  ≥  0 the solution φ of

[formula]

satisfies

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since V  ≥  0, [formula] we have [formula] is an isomorphism and ||φ||W2,p  ≤  c||f||Lp for some constant c independent of f. By Sobolev embedding, W2,p embeds continuously in L∞ which establishes inequality [\eqref=eq:upperineq].

Let G(x,y) be the Green's function for [formula]. Then, since f  ≥  0,

[formula]

where mG is the lower bound for G(x,y) found in Proposition [\ref=prop:greenest]. This implies inequality [\eqref=eq:lowerineq] with c2 = mG.

We can now establish the desired lower bound (in the Yamabe non-negative case) for [formula] when φ  ≤  φ+.

Suppose φ+∈W2,p+ is a global supersolution, Yg  ≥  0, and [formula]. Then there exists a constant K0 > 0 such that whenever 0 < φ  ≤  φ+,

[formula]

Suppose 0 < φ0  ≤  φ+ and let [formula]. We will construct a subsolution φ- of the equation

[formula]

and determine a lower bound K0 for φ- that is independent of the choice of φ0. Estimate [\eqref=newlowbound] then follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:superbound].

The construction of the subsolution follows a procedure found in [\cite=Maxwell05]. Pick ψ∈W2,p+ such that ĝ  =  ψ4g has continuous positive or zero scalar curvature depending on the sign of Yg. Define [formula] and let η be the solution of

[formula]

Since [formula] and is not identically zero, it follows that the solution η exists and is positive.

We now claim that αη is a subsolution of

[formula]

if α is taken small enough. To see this, note that

[formula]

Hence αη is a subsolution if α8  ≤  η- 7 and α  ≤  η- 1; we take α  =   min (1, max (η)- 1). By Lemma [\ref=lem:confcov] it follows that ψ- 1αη is a subsolution of [\eqref=lichcopy]. If we can determine a uniform lower bound m' for αη, then setting K0  =   min (ψ- 1)m' completes the proof.

To find a uniform lower bound for αη  =   min (1, max (η)- 1)η, it suffices to find uniform upper and lower bounds for η. From Proposition [\ref=prop:Vhilow] applied to [formula] we have constants c1 and c2 such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since ψ is a fixed conformal factor and does not depend on φ, it suffices to estimate

[formula]

and

[formula]

Following the argument at the start of Section [\ref=sec:coupled] we have

[formula]

Since [formula] we have obtained the desired lower bound.

On the other hand,

[formula]

Moreover, from Proposition [\ref=prop:West]

[formula]

which establishes the desired upper bound.

The proof of the lower bound in the Yamabe negative case is much easier. In [\cite=const-non-cmc-compact] a global subsolution was found under the hypothesis that τ has no zeros. This was extended by [\cite=Holstetal07] to any compatible τ using a technique from [\cite=Maxwell05]. The proof is short, and we reproduce it here.

Suppose Yg < 0 and that τ is Lichnerowicz compatible. Then there exists a constant K0 > 0 such for any φ∈L∞+,

[formula]

Pick η∈W2,p+ such that ĝ  =  η4g has scalar curvature [formula]; such a conformal factor exists since τ is Lichnerowicz compatible. Then

[formula]

Hence η is a subsolution. Lemma [\ref=lem:superbound] then implies that φ  ≥  η and hence K0  =   min η is a lower bound.

Mapping properties of [formula]

Suppose that φ+∈W2,p is a global supersolution. Let K0 be the constant from Proposition [\ref=prop:yposlow] or [\ref=prop:yneglow] depending on the sign of Yg, and define U = {φ∈L∞:K0  ≤  φ  ≤  φ+}. We know from Section [\ref=sec:invariant] that U is invariant under [formula], and we now complete the proof using the Schauder fixed point theorem that [formula] has a fixed point in U. As mentioned earlier, it suffices to show that [formula] is continuous and [formula] is precompact.

There exists a constant M such that for any φ∈U,

[formula]

Let [formula], and let [formula]. We have the elliptic regularity estimate

[formula]

Since 0 < ψ  ≤  φ+ we have [formula]. Also, ψ solves

[formula]

Since R∈Lp, σ∈L2p, 0 < K0  ≤  ψ  ≤  φ+, and since Proposition [\ref=prop:West] implies

[formula]

it follows that the right-hand side of [\eqref=compest] is bounded in Lp independent of φ. Hence inequality [\eqref=compest1] holds.

The set [formula] is precompact.

From Proposition [\ref=prop:Ncpct], it follows that [formula] is contained in a ball in W2,p and hence in a ball in C1,α. By the compact embedding of C1,α in L∞, we conclude that [formula] is compact.

To show [formula] is continuous, it is enough to show that [formula] and [formula] are continuous. That [formula] is continuous is obvious, but there is something to show for [formula]. The continuity in this case follows from the implicit function theorem.

If g∈W2,p and τ∈L2p are Lichnerowicz compatible, then the map [formula] is C1.

Let β0∈Dτ and let [formula]. Define ĝ  =  ψ40g and let [formula] be the corresponding Lichnerowicz operator. That is, (β) is the solution of

[formula]

By conformal covariance we have

[formula]

and hence to show that [formula] is C1 near β0 it suffices to show that [formula] is C1 near 0  =  ψ- 20β0. Noting that [formula], we may drop the hat notation and it suffices to show that [formula] is C1 near any point β0 such that [formula].

Define F:W2,p+  ×  Dτ  →  L2p by

[formula]

the Lichnerowicz operator satisfies [formula]. A standard computation shows that the Gâteaux derivative of F is given by

[formula]

It is easily seen that the operator DF is continuous in φ and β.

Now

[formula]

But since [formula],

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Since the potential [formula] is non-negative and does not vanish identically (since g and τ are Lichnerowicz compatible and β0 is admissible), we conclude that DF1,β0:W2,p  →  Lp is an isomorphism. The implicit function theorem then implies that [formula] is a C1 function in a neighborhood of β0.

This completes the proof of Theorem 1. Our result of primary interest, Corollary [\ref=cor:nonvac], relies crucially on the HNK supersolution. For completeness, we give a proof here of its existence.

Suppose g∈W2,p with p > 3, Yg > 0, τ∈W1,p, and σ∈W1,p. If ||σ||∞ is sufficiently small, then there exists a global supersolution of [\eqref=sys-lich]-[\eqref=sys-momentum].

Pick ψ∈W2,p+ such that the scalar curvature R̂ of ĝ  =  ψ4g is strictly positive. We claim that if ε is sufficiently small, and if ||σ||L∞ is additionally sufficiently small, then εψ is a global supersolution.

Suppose 0 < φ  ≤  εψ, and let W be the corresponding solution of [\eqref=sys-momentum]. Note that

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=prop:West] there exists a constant Kτ such that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

[formula]

Now pick ε so small that

[formula]

is positive. It then follows that εψ is a global supersolution so long as ||σ||L∞ is so small that the right hand side of [\eqref=lastest] remains positive.

Vacuum solutions as the limit of non-vacuum solutions

In this section we give an alternative proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:nonvac] using sequences of non-vacuum solutions. We start with the following theorem which is an immediate consequence of the results of [\cite=Holstetal07].

Let g∈W2,p with p > 3 be a metric on a smooth, compact 3-manifold. Suppose that g has no conformal Killing fields, g is Yamabe positive, and that σ∈W1,p is a transverse traceless tensor and τ∈W1,p. If  ||σ||L∞ is sufficiently small, then for each [formula] there exists a solution (φn,Wn)∈W2,p+  ×  W2,p of

[formula]

Moreover, there exists a constant N+ > 0 independent of n such that 0 < φn  ≤  N+ for every n.

We now consider what happens to the sequence (φn,Wn) and show a subsequence of it converges to a solution (φ,W) of the vacuum equations.

There is a subsequence of {Wn} that converges in W1,p and weakly in W2,p to a limit W. Moreover, [formula] converges uniformly to [formula].

From Proposition [\ref=prop:West] we have

[formula]

So the sequence {Wn} is bounded in W2,p and has a subsequence that converges weakly in W2,p and strongly in W1,p to a limit W.

Reducing to this subsequence, we know that [formula] is bounded in Cα since {Wn} is bounded in W2,p and therefore in C1,α for some α > 0. But then by the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, a subsequence converges in C0. Since [formula] in Lp, we conclude that [formula] in C0.

We henceforth reduce to this subsequence.

Suppose [formula]. Then [formula].

If [formula] then [formula] weakly, and hence W is in the kernel of the vector Laplacian. In particular [formula], so [formula], a contradiction.

We henceforth also assume that [formula], which is necessary to establish the following lower bound for the sequence.

If [formula], then there is a constant N- such that

[formula]

for every n.

Pick ψ̂∈W2,p+ such that ĝ  =  ψ̂4g has positive scalar curvature Rĝ; this is possible since Yg > 0. Let [formula], [formula], n  =  ψ̂- 2βn,   =  ψ̂- 2β, and n  =  ψ- 8ρn.

Following [\cite=Maxwell05] we seek non-constant sub- and supersolutions of

[formula]

We will find a positive lower bound for the sub-solutions and use this lower bound to obtain a positive lower bound for the functions φn.

For each n, let ψn be the solution of

[formula]

which exists since [formula]. Since n and n converge uniformly to [formula] and 0, it follows that ψn converges in W2,p to the solution ψ of

[formula]

In particular, from Sobolev embedding, this convergence is in C0. Note that since β (i.e. [formula]) is not identically zero, ψ is not identically zero. From the weak and strong maxiumum principles ([\cite=epde] Theorems 8.1 and 8.19) it follows that each ψn and also ψ is a positive function. Since the convergence is uniform on a compact manifold, there are constants m and M such that 0 < m  ≤  ψn  ≤  M for every n.

Consider the function αψn. Then

[formula]

One readily verifies that if α  ≥   max (1, min (ψn)- 1) then each term on the right-hand side of [\eqref=subsupmat] is non-negative and αψn is a supersolution. We define α+  =   max (1,m- 1).

Similarly, if α  ≤   min (1, max (ψn)- 1) then each term on the right-hand side of [\eqref=subsupmat] is non-positive and αψn is a subsolution. We define α-  =   max (1,M- 1).

Since α-ψn and α+ψn are sub- and supersolutions of [\eqref=el:lich] it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:confcov] that α-ψ- 1ψn and α+ψ- 1φn are sub- and supersolutions of [\eqref=sys-lich-matter]. Lemma [\ref=lem:superbound] then implies

[formula]

for each n. Letting N-  =  α- max (ψ)- 1m completes the proof.

A subsequence of {φn} converges uniformly and in W1,p to a function φ∈W2,p+ that is a solution of

[formula]

The functions φn solve

[formula]

Since the right-hand side of [\eqref=phinsolve] is bounded in Lp (here we use the fact that N-  ≤  φn  ≤  N+ for every n) we conclude from elliptic regularity estimate

[formula]

that the sequence {φn} is bounded in W2,p. Reducing to a subsequence, we conclude that {φn} converges weakly in W2,p and strongly in W1,p and also in C0 to a limit φ∈W2,p and φ  ≥  N- > 0. A standard convergence argument shows that φ is a weak solution of

[formula]

Since φ is a weak solution and φ∈W2,p we conclude that φ is a strong solution.

The vector field W is a solution of

[formula]

Since Wn  →  W in W1,p and φ6ndτ  →  φ6dτ in Lp, and since

[formula]

a standard argument shows that W weakly solves

[formula]

Since W∈W2,p, W is a strong solution.

This completes the second proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:nonvac].

Conclusion

The conformal method of solving the Einstein constraint equations is remarkably effective when the mean curvature is constant, and is remarkably recalcitrant when it is not. In this paper we have made progress towards our understanding of the non-CMC case. We have proved that there exist solutions of the vacuum constraint equations whenever a global supersolution can be found. Using a well-known near-CMC global supersolution, we have simplified the hypotheses required for existence in the near-CMC case. And as a consequence of the HNT supersolution, we have shown that for Yamabe-positive metrics, and for small enough transverse traceless tensors, there exist vacuum solutions of the constraint equations for any choice of mean curvature.

Our existence theorem shows that any potential failure of the conformal method must arise from a loss of control from above of the conformal factor. Currently known global supersolutions impose this control by making strong smallness assumptions, either on the mean curvature, or on the transverse traceless tensor. Presumably one can interpolate between these smallness conditions, but the question of existence for generic large data remains open. There also remain numerous other open questions, including the existence of far-from-CMC solutions for Yamabe-null or Yamabe-negative metrics, uniqueness for far-from-CMC data, and existence for metrics admitting conformal Killing fields. As a consequence, the applicability of the conformal method for general mean curvatures remains largely unknown. Nevertheless, the results of [\cite=Holstetal07] and the current paper are a step towards answering this question.
