A proof of the Dalang-Morton-Willinger theorem

Introduction

Let [formula] be a probability space, endowed with a discrete-time filtration [formula], [formula]. Consider a d-dimensional stochastic process S = (Sn)Nn = 0, adapted to the filtration [formula], and a d-dimensional [formula]-predictable process γ = (γn)Nn = 1, that is, γn is [formula]-measurable. In the customary securities market model Sin describes the discounted price of ith stock and γin corresponds to the number of stock units in investor's portfolio at time moment n. The discounted gain process is given by where (  ·  ,  ·  ) is the scalar product in [formula].

Let's recall the classical Dalang-Morton-Willinger theorem [\cite=DalMorWil90], [\cite=Shi98] (ch.V, § 2e). As usual, we say that the No Arbitrage (NA) condition is satisfied if the inequality GγN  ≥  0 a.s. (with respect to the measure [formula]) implies that GγN = 0 a.s. A probability measure [formula] on [formula] is called a martingale measure if the process S is a [formula]-martingale. Measures [formula] and [formula] are called equivalent if their null sets are the same. Denote by κn - 1(ω) the support of the regular conditional distribution [formula] of the random vector ΔSn with respect to [formula]: where [formula] is the ball of center x and radius ε.

The following conditions are equivalent:

NA;

there exists an equivalent to [formula] martingale measure [formula] with a.s. bounded density [formula];

the relative interior of the convex hull of κn - 1 contains the origin a.s., [formula].

At this degree of generality Theorem 1 was proved in [\cite=DalMorWil90]. Besides the original one, several alternative proofs [\cite=Sch92], [\cite=KabKra94], [\cite=Rog94], [\cite=JacShi98], [\cite=KabStr01] were proposed. The "difficult" part of this theorem is the implication (i) [formula] (ii) or (iii) [formula] (ii), though, in fact, it is sufficient to consider the case of integrable process S and N = 1.

In [\cite=DalMorWil90] and [\cite=JacShi98] the desired martingale measure is constructed at first in the case of trivial σ-algebra [formula] and then in general case with the use of subtle measurable selection arguments. Another approach, based on the closedness in probability (under the NA condition) of the cone C of random variables, dominated by investor's gains GγN, was proposed in [\cite=Sch92]. By the Kreps-Yan theorem this property implies the existence of a strictly positive essentially bounded function g such that [formula], [formula], where [formula] is the expectation with respect to [formula] and L1 is the space of [formula]-integrable functions. The function g, up to the normalization constant, coincides with the [formula]-density of an equivalent martingale measure. The subsequent work in this direction [\cite=KabKra94], [\cite=KabStr01] allowed to simplify the proof of the closedness of C, as well as the proof of the existence of g. We also have mentioned the paper [\cite=Rog94] (see [\cite=DelSch06], sect. 6.6 and [\cite=Del99] for expositions), where an equivalent martingale measure is determined by the solution of some optimization problem.

Our approach is based on the following general statement. Let X be a Banach lattice ([\cite=AliBor06], chap.9) with the topological dual X*. Denote by X*+ the non-negative cone of X* and consider a convex cone C  ⊂  X. If an element f∈X* is bounded from above on a certain subset of C: then there exists an element g∈X* such that g  ≥  f, g(w)  ≤  0, x∈C. The results of this type were exploited in [\cite=Rok05], [\cite=Rok08b] to prove new versions of the Kreps-Yan theorem and in [\cite=RokSch06], [\cite=Rok08a] to analyse lower bounds of martingale measure densities.

Let S be an integrable process, X = L1 and let Kn  ⊂  L1 be the subspace of the elements (γn,ΔSn), where γn is an Fn - 1-measurable vector with bounded components. The topological dual of L1 is the space L∞ of essentially bounded functions. Assuming the mentioned result, we see that it is sufficient to present a strictly positive element f∈L∞ with to prove the existence of an equivalent martingale measure with bounded density for (Sn - 1,Sn). Namely, this density corresponds to an element g∈L∞: g  ≥  f, [formula], w∈Kn, indicated above.

In contrast to [\cite=Sch92], [\cite=KabKra94], [\cite=KabStr01], this approach does not require to prove the closedness (in probability or in L1) of the cone C or the subspace Kn. As compared to [\cite=DalMorWil90], [\cite=JacShi98], we do not consider set-valued mappings, whose values lie in infinite dimensional spaces, and do not use delicate Aumann's measurable selection theorem ([\cite=AliBor06], Theorem 18.26) and "projection theorem" ([\cite=AliBor06], Theorem 18.25). The mathematical tools of this paper include: (a) relatively simple results of the theory of measurable set-valued mappings with values in [formula] ("preservation of measurability" theorems, the Kuratowski-Ryll-Nardzewski measurable selection theorem, Castaing representation: sect. 14A, 14B of [\cite=RocWet98]); (b) standard duality results (separation theorems, weak*-compactness of the unit ball in the dual space); (c) well-known probabilistic results, concerning the conditional distributions and conditional expectations.

We do not pretend that the proof presented below is simpler, shorter or better than the existing ones. Rather it gives a somewhat different view of the problem.

Auxillary statements

Let [formula] be a sub-σ-algebra of [formula]. Recall that a set-valued mapping F, assigning some set [formula] to each ω∈Ω, is called [formula]-measurable, if [formula] for any open set [formula]. A function [formula] is called a selector of F, if η(ω)∈F(ω) for all [formula]. Denote by [formula] the set of [formula]-measurable selectors of F. According to the Kuratowski-Ryll-Nardzewski theorem we have [formula] for any [formula]-measurable set-valued mapping F with closed values F(ω) ([\cite=RocWet98], Corollary 14.6). Moreover, there exists a Castaing representation of F, that is, a sequence (ηi)∞i = 1 of [formula]-measurable selectors of F such that the sets {ηi(ω)}∞i = 1 are dense in F(ω) for all ω∈dom  F ([\cite=RocWet98], Theorem 14.5).

Let [formula] and [formula] be the Banach spaces of equivalence classes of [formula]-measurable real-valued functions with the norms [formula] and [formula]. Denote by [formula], p∈{1,  ∞  } the set of equivalence classes of [formula]-measurable vectors, satisfying the conditions η∈F a.s., [formula], where |x| = (x,x)1 / 2; and denote by [formula], [formula], p∈{1,  ∞  } the sets of non-negative and strictly positive elements of [formula] respectively. In what follows, for brevity, we omit the argument [formula] in the above notation.

By ri  A, conv  A, cone  A and lin  A we denote the relative interior, the convex hull, the conic hull and the linear span of a subset A of a finite dimensional space. If A is a cone then [formula] is the polar cone.

The support κξ of the regular conditional distribution [formula] of the random vector ξ with respect to [formula] is an [formula]-measurable set-valued mapping: for any open set [formula]. The "preservation of measurability" results ([\cite=RocWet98], Proposition 14.11, Example 14.12) show that the set-valued mapping

[formula]

where [formula] is the unit sphere of [formula], is [formula]-measurable. It is easy to see that [formula], if and only if ω belongs to the set [formula] Hence, [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula], where [formula]. Then there exists an [formula]-measurable random vector [formula] such that [formula], [formula].

Proof. By virtue of the Kuratowski-Ryll-Nardzewski theorem we can take [formula], where G is defined by ([\ref=eq1]). Put γ  =  ηIAξ. Then since (γ(ω),x)  ≥  0, x∈κξ(ω) and [formula] for all ω∈Ω. Moreover, Actually, for any ω∈Aξ there exists y∈κξ(ω) such that (γ(ω),y) > 0. Thus, [formula] for all ω∈Aξ. [formula]

It is clear that Lemma [\ref=lem1] leads to the proof of the assertion (i) [formula] (iii) of Theorem 1. The remaining reasoning of this section prepare the proof of the key implication (iii) [formula] (ii). In fact, it is sufficient to establish the next result.

Let [formula] and 0∈ri  (conv  κξ) a.s. Then there exists [formula] such that [formula].

We prove Lemma [\ref=lem2] by the following scheme. Any element [formula] induces the linear functional on [formula] by the formula [formula]. Consider the subspace

[formula]

Under the assumption 0∈ri  (conv  κξ) a.s. there exists an element [formula], which is bounded from above one the special subset K1 of K: (Lemma [\ref=lem5] below). It follows that there exists [formula], g  ≥  f such that: 〈w,g〉 = 0, w∈K (Lemma [\ref=lem7]). This element g satisfies the conditions of Lemma [\ref=lem2].

We turn to the realization of this scheme. Let [formula] and [formula]. Clearly, [formula] and [formula]. We put and introduce the set-valued mapping

[formula]

Let [formula] and 0∈ri  (conv  κξ) a.s. Then the set-valued mapping T, defined by ([\ref=eq3]), is [formula]-measurable and has compact values T(ω) a.s.

Proof. The function [formula] is convex in h for each ω and ψ(ω,0) = 0. Thus the set [formula] is convex and has non-empty interior for all ω∈Ω. It follows that the [formula]-measurability of T' is implied by the simple test of having

[formula]

for every [formula] ([\cite=RocWet98], Example 14.7), and T is [formula]-measurable as an intersection of [formula]-measurable set-valued mappings ([\cite=RocWet98], Proposition 14.11(a)).

Assume that [formula]. Since 0∈ri  (conv  κξ(ω)), it follows that for [formula] the set κξ(ω) is not contained in the half-space {x∈lin  κξ(ω):(h,x)  ≥  0}. Thus ψ(ω,h) > 0 and the set T(ω) is compact, because ψ(ω,h)  →    ∞   as |h|  →    ∞  , h∈lin  κξ(ω). [formula]

Let [formula] and 0∈ri  (conv  κξ). If (γ,ξ)  ≥  0 a.s. for some [formula], then γ = 0 a.s.

Proof. Put A = {γ  ≠  0}. For any ω∈A there exists y∈κξ(ω) such that (γ(ω),y) < 0 and hence [formula]. If [formula], then we obtain the contradiction:

Let (ηi)∞i = 1 be an [formula]-measurable Castaing representation of T and let [formula] be an [formula]-measurable vector. Denote by s(x|A) =  sup {(x,y):y∈A} the support function of a set A. From it follows that the function s(ζ|T) is [formula]-measurable. In addition it is a.s. finite, owing to the compactness of T(ω).

Let [formula] and 0∈ri  (conv  κξ) a.s. For

[formula]

we have

Proof. Put [formula]. We see that

[formula]

Putting [formula], we get

[formula]

On the set {w = 0} we have the equality [formula]. Therefore, [formula] and γI{w = 0} = 0 by Lemma [\ref=lem4]. Putting γ = wθ, where θ is an [formula]-measurable vector, we obtain

Since the values of θ on the set {w = 0} do not affect [formula], by the definition of T and the equality [formula] a.s., we get But [formula] a.s. for [formula]. This yields that [formula]. [formula]

Denote by U∞ the unit ball of the space [formula] and put [formula], w+  =   max {w,0}.

For any element [formula] we have

[formula]

Proof. If ζ = I{w  ≥  0}∈U∞+, then [formula] On the other hand,

Recall that the closure of a convex set [formula] in the weak topology σ(L1,L∞) coincides with its norm closure in [formula].

Let K be a subspace of [formula] and [formula]. If then there exists an element [formula], satisfying the conditions

Proof. Put λ  =   sup w∈K1〈w,f〉. If the assertion of lemma is false, then By applying the separation theorem ([\cite=AliBor06], Theorem 5.79) to the σ(L∞,L1)-compact set f + λU∞+ and σ(L∞,L1)-closed set [formula], we conclude that there exists [formula] such that Since K is a subspace it follows that 〈v,z〉 = 0, [formula] and v∈cl1K by the bipolar theorem ([\cite=AliBor06], Theorem 5.103), where cl1K is the closure of K in the norm topology of [formula]. Moreover,

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem6] we have

[formula]

If v- = 0 then 〈v,f〉 > 0 and [formula] for any α > 0. Hence, the functional w  ↦  〈w,f〉 is unbounded from above on the ray {αv:α > 0}, which is contained in the set Here we have used an elementary inclusion [formula], which holds true when the set A is open.

Thus, [formula] and it follows from ([\ref=eq5]), ([\ref=eq6]) that in contradiction to the definition of λ, since [formula]. [formula]

Note that for any [formula] there exists an [formula]-measurable function φ(ω,x), satisfying the condition [formula] a.s. Here [formula] is the Borel σ-algebra of [formula] and σ(ξ) is the σ-algebra, generated by ξ. This statement follows from the fact that the σ-algebra [formula] is generated by the mapping ω  ↦  (ω,ξ(ω)) from Ω to the measurable space [formula] (see [\cite=AliBor06], Theorem 4.41).

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lem2]. Let K be the subspace, defined by ([\ref=eq2]). By Lemma [\ref=lem5] the element f, defined by ([\ref=eq4]), considered as a functional on [formula], satisfies the conditions of Lemma [\ref=lem7]. An element g, indicated in Lemma [\ref=lem7], belongs to [formula] and

[formula]

But ([\ref=eq7]) is reduced to the equality [formula]. Indeed, since where φ is some [formula]-measurable function, by putting and passing in ([\ref=eq7]) to the limit as M  →    ∞  , we conclude that [formula] by the monotone convergence theorem. [formula]

Proof of the Dalang-Morton-Willinger theorem

(iii) [formula] (ii). Let us first show that the supports κn of the regular conditional distributions [formula] are a.s. invariant under equivalent changes of measure. Let [formula] be an equivalent (to [formula]) probability measure and let (Zn')Nn = 0 be the correspondent density process: Denote by [formula] the regular conditional distribution of ΔSn with respect to Fn - 1, induced by the measure [formula]. By the Bayes formula ([\cite=Shi98], chap. V, § 3a) we have where B is a Borel subset of [formula]. Let φn be an [formula]-measurable function, satisfying the condition Then For any An - 1∈Fn - 1 we have since φn(ω,ΔSn(ω)) > 0 a.s. Hence, for some set Ω' with [formula] the inequality φ(ω,x) > 0 holds true almost everywhere with respect to the measure [formula] if ω∈Ω'. This means that for ω∈Ω' the measures [formula], [formula] are equivalent and their supports are the same.

By virtue of the proved invariance property we can assume that [formula]. Otherwise we may pass to the measure [formula] with density where c > 0 is the normalizing constant. In this case [formula] and [formula], if [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lem2] for any [formula] there exists gn∈L∞+  + such that Further argumentation is borrowed from [\cite=DelSch06], sect. 6.7. If N = 1, then the measure [formula] with density [formula] has the desired property:

Assume now that the assertion under consideration is true for N = m - 1. Applying it to the processes (Sn)mn = 1, (Sn)1n = 0, we see that on [formula] there exists an equivalent martingale measure [formula] for (Sn)mn = 1 with [formula]-density [formula] and on [formula] there exists an equivalent martingale measure [formula] for (Sn)1n = 0 with [formula]-density [formula]. Define on [formula] the probability measure [formula] by Clearly, [formula]. It remains to check that the process (Sn)mn = 0 is a [formula]-martingale.

For n = 1 this follows from the definition of f1: For n > 1 by the definition of [formula] and the [formula]-measurability of f1 we have:

(i) [formula] (iii). Suppose that [formula] for some n on a set [formula] with [formula]. Put γj = 0, j  ≠  n. Applying Lemma [\ref=lem1] to ξ  =  ΔSn we conclude that there exists an [formula]-measurable vector [formula] such that Thus the NA condition is violated.

(ii) [formula] (i). If S fails the NA property, then for some n there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

that is, there exists a one-step arbitrage opportunity. We do not reproduce here the simple and well-known proof of this statement (see, e.g., [\cite=Sch92], Lemma 1.2). Evidently, ([\ref=eq8]) contradicts the existence of an equivalent martingale measure [formula], since [formula]. [formula]
