Eppstein's bound on intersecting triangles revisited

Introduction

Let S be a set of n points in the plane in general position (no three points on a line), and let T be a set of [formula] triangles with vertices in S. Aronov et al. [\cite=ACEGSW] showed that there always exists a point in the plane contained in the interior of

[formula]

triangles of T. Eppstein [\cite=eppstein] subsequently claimed to have improved this bound to

[formula]

There is a problem in Eppstein's proof, however. In this note we provide a correct proof of ([\ref=eq_bound_log2]), by slightly modifying Eppstein's argument.

The Second Selection Lemma and k-sets

The above result is the special case d = 2 of the following lemma (called the Second Selection Lemma in [\cite=matou]), whose proof was put together by Bárány et al. [\cite=BFL], Alon et al. [\cite=ABFK], and Zivaljevi and Vreica [\cite=ZV]:

If S is an n-point set in [formula] and T is a family of [formula] d-simplices spanned by S, then there exists a point [formula] contained in at least

[formula]

simplices of T, for some constants cd and sd that depend only on d.

(Note that m / nd + 1  =  O(1), so the smaller the constant sd, the stronger the bound.) Thus, for d = 2 the constant s2 in ([\ref=eq_2nd_SL]) can be taken arbitrarily close to 3. The general proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma_2nd_sel] gives very large bounds for sd; roughly sd  ≈  (4d + 1)d + 1.

The main motivation for the Second Selection Lemma is deriving upper bounds for the maximum number of k-sets of an n-point set in [formula]; see [\cite=matou] for the definition and details.

The proof

We assume that m  =  Ω(n2 log 2 / 3n), since otherwise the bound ([\ref=eq_bound_log2]) is trivial. The proof, like the proof of the previous bound ([\ref=eq_bound_log5]), relies on the following two one-dimensional selection lemmas [\cite=ACEGSW]:

Let V be a set of n points on the real line, and let E be a set of m distinct intervals with endpoints in V. Then there exists a point x lying in the interior of Ω(m2 / n2) intervals of E.

Let V be a set of n points on the real line, and let E be a multiset of m intervals with endpoints in V. Then there exists a multiset E'  ⊆  E of m' intervals, having as endpoints a subset V'  ⊆  V of n' points, such that all the intervals of E' contain a common point x in their interior, and such that

The proof of the desired bound ([\ref=eq_bound_log2]) proceeds as follows:

Assume without loss of generality that no two points of S have the same x-coordinate. For each triangle in T define its base to be the edge with the longest x-projection. For each pair of points a,b∈S, let Tab be the set of triangles in T that have ab as base, and let mab  =  |Tab|. (Thus, [formula].)

Discard all sets Tab for which mab  <  m / n2. We discarded at most [formula] triangles, so we are left with a subset T' of at least m / 2 triangles, such that either mab  =  0 or mab  ≥  m / n2 for each base ab.

Partition the bases into a logarithmic number of subsets [formula] for k  =   log 4(n3 / m), so that each Ej contains all the bases ab for which

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the set of triangles with bases in Ej, and mj  =  |Tj| denote their number. There must exist an index j for which since otherwise the total number of triangles in T' would be less than m / 2. From now on we fix this j, and work only with the bases in Ej and the triangles in Tj.

For each pair of triangles abc, abd having the same base ab∈Ej, project the segment cd into the x-axis, obtaining segment c'd'. We thus obtain a multiset M0 of horizontal segments, with (Each of the mj triangles in Tj is paired with all other triangles sharing the same base, and each such pair is counted twice.)

We now apply the Weighted Selection Lemma (Lemma [\ref=lemma_weighted]) to M0, obtaining a multiset M1 of segments delimited by n1 distinct endpoints, all segments containing some point z0 in their interior, with

Let [formula] be the vertical line passing through z0. For each horizontal segment c'd'∈M1, each of its (possibly multiple) instances in M1 originates from a pair of triangles abc, abd, where points a and c lie to the left of [formula], and points b and d lie to the right of [formula]. Let p be the intersection of [formula] with ad, and let q be the intersection of [formula] with bc. Then, pq is a vertical segment along [formula], contained in the union of the triangles abc, abd (see Figure [\ref=fig_triangle_pair]). Let M2 be the set of all these segments pq for all c'd'∈M1.

Note that the vertical segments in M2 are all distinct, since each such segment pq uniquely determines the originating points a, b, c, d (assuming z0 was chosen in general position).

Let n2 be the number of endpoints of the segments in M2. We have n2  ≤  nn1, since each endpoint (such as p) is uniquely determined by one of n1 "inner" vertices (such as d) and one of at most n "outer" vertices (such as a).

Next, apply the Unweighted Selection Lemma (Lemma [\ref=lemma_unw]) to M2, obtaining a point [formula] that is contained in segments in M2. Thus, x0 is contained in at least these many unions of pairs of triangles of Tj. But by ([\ref=eq_bound_m_ab]), each triangle in Tj participates in at most 4jm  /  n2 pairs. Therefore, x0 is contained in triangles of Tj.

Discussion

Eppstein [\cite=eppstein] also showed that there always exists a point in [formula] contained in Ω(m / n) triangles of T. This latter bound is stronger than ([\ref=eq_bound_log2]) for small m, namely for m  =  O(n5 / 2 log n).

On the other hand, as Eppstein also showed [\cite=eppstein], for every n-point set S in general position and every m  =  Ω(n2), [formula], there exists a set T of m triangles with vertices in S, such that no point in the plane is contained in more than O(m2 / n3) triangles of T. Thus, with the current lack of any better lower bound, the bound ([\ref=eq_bound_log2]) appears to be far from tight. Even achieving a lower bound of Ω(m3 / n6), without any logarithmic factors, is a major challenge still unresolved.

It is known, however, that if S is a set of n points in [formula] in general position (no four points on a plane), and T is a set of m triangles spanned by S, then there exists a line (in fact, a line spanned by two points of S) that intersects the interior of Ω(m3 / n6) triangles of T; see [\cite=DE] and [\cite=smo_phd] for two different proofs of this.
