Hyperdeterminantal point processes

Introduction

Motivated by considerations of the behavior of fermions in quantum mechanics, determinantal point processes were introduced in [\cite=MR0380979]. Surveys of their properties and numerous applications may be found in [\cite=MR950166] [\cite=MR1799012] [\cite=MR2031202] [\cite=MR2216966] [\cite=MR1940779] [\cite=MR2018415] [\cite=MR1989442] [\cite=MR2073340].

We consider a certain extension of this class of point processes. In order to motivate our generalization, we first consider a particular case of the determinantal point process construction. Suppose that on some measure space (Σ,A,μ) we have a kernel [formula] that defines an L dimensional projection operator for L2(μ). That is,

K(x;y)  =  q(y;x) for all x,y∈Σ,

[formula] for all [formula] and [formula],

[formula] for all x,z∈Σ,

[formula].

The corresponding determinantal point process can then be thought of as an exchangeable random vector with values in ΣL. The distribution of this random vector is a probability measure that has the density

[formula]

with respect to the measure [formula].

One of the most agreeable things about this construction is that for 1  ≤  N  ≤  L the N-dimensional marginal distributions of the random vector have (common) density

[formula]

with respect to the measure [formula]. Consequently, the conditional distribution of the [formula] component of the ΣL-valued random vector given the first N components can be computed explicitly (as a constant multiple of a ratio of determinants). It is thus possible to simulate the entire ΣL-valued random vector if one is able to simulate a general Σ-valued random variable from a knowledge of its probability density function.

Various generalizations of determinantal point processes have appeared in the literature. Note that

[formula]

where [formula] is the symmetric group of permutations of [formula] and ε is the usual alternating character on the symmetric group (that is, the sign of a permutation). It is natural to replace ε by other class functions on the symmetric group (that is, by other functions that only depend on the cycle structure of a permutation and hence are constant on conjugacy classes of the symmetric group). The most obvious choice is to replace ε by the trivial character which always takes the value 1, thereby turning the determinant into a permanent. Permanental point processes arise in the description of bosons and are discussed in [\cite=MR0380979] [\cite=MR2216966] [\cite=MR950166] [\cite=MR2018415] [\cite=MR2073340]. Replacing ε by a general irreducible character gives the immanantal point processes of [\cite=MR1780025], while setting ε(σ)  =  αL - ν(σ) for - 1  <  α  <  1 and ν(σ) the number of cycles of σ gives the alpha-permanental processes introduced in [\cite=MR1450811] and further studied in [\cite=MR2018415] [\cite=MR2216966].

All of these constructions have the feature that an exchangeable joint density is built up as a linear combination of products of pairwise interactions. In this paper we investigate the possibility of building up a tractable joint density as a linear combination of products of higher order interactions. In order to accomplish such a generalization, it is necessary to have higher order counterparts for both projection kernels and determinants.

Note that [formula] is the kernel of an L-dimensional projection if and only if

[formula]

where [formula] are orthonormal in L2(μ). One possible [formula] order extension of this second order definition is to suppose that:

the underlying space Σ is a Cartesian product [formula],

the measure μ on Σ is a product measure [formula],

the functions [formula], 1  ≤  m  ≤  M, [formula], are given by [formula], where for 1  ≤  m  ≤  M the functions [formula], [formula], belong to L2(μm) and are orthonormal in L2(μm),

the kernel [formula] is given by

[formula]

Note that the integral

[formula]

is 1 if [formula] for 1  ≤  m  ≤  M, and the integral is 0 otherwise. This is analogous to the orthonormality of the functions [formula] appearing in the representation above of an L-dimensional projection, and when M = 1 we just recover that representation.

The appropriate generalization of the determinant is given by Cayley's first hyperdeterminant that was introduced in [\cite=Cay43] and which we will describe shortly. Cayley later introduced other generalizations of the determinant that he also called hyperdeterminants and are more natural from the point of view of invariant theory - see [\cite=MR1196989] [\cite=MR1264417]. Early treatments of the theory related to Cayley's original definition may be found in [\cite=Pas00] [\cite=MR0114826] [\cite=MR1506358] [\cite=Ric30] [\cite=MR1523115] [\cite=MR1503184] [\cite=MR1503183] [\cite=MR1501856] [\cite=MR0001195]. More recent works are [\cite=MR0130256] [\cite=MR0352115]. We remark that Cayley's first hyperdeterminant has been useful in matroid theory [\cite=MR1355700] [\cite=Gly06] and we also note the interesting papers [\cite=MR1985318] [\cite=LuqThi04] in which the calculation of Selberg and Aomoto integrals is reduced to the evaluation of hyperdeterminants of suitable multi-dimensional arrays.

Suppose that

[formula]

is a 2M-way hypercubic matrix (that is, [formula] is a a 2M-dimensional array or tensor that is of the same length, namely N, in each direction). Suppose further that K is a subset of [formula]. We define the corresponding hyperdeterminant of [formula] to be

[formula]

where [formula] is the symmetric group of permutations of [formula] and, as above, ε is the alternating character. This definition is just the usual definition of the hyperdeterminant of a general hypercubic matrix with a general "signancy", except that we have imposed the restriction that the coordinate directions of the matrix are grouped in pairs, and each coordinate direction in a pair has the same signancy. When M = 1, so that [formula] is just an N  ×  N matrix, [formula] is either the usual determinant or the permanent, depending on whether K is {1} or [formula].

Note: From now on we will assume that K is non-empty.

We are now ready to define a family of exchangeable probability densities. For 1  ≤  N  ≤  L, define the function [formula] by

[formula]

where [formula] is the 2M-way hypercubic matrix of length N given by

[formula]

That is,

[formula]

We will prove the following theorem in Section [\ref=S:proof_of_main].

The function pL is the density with respect to [formula] of a probability measure on [formula]. We show in Section [\ref=S:varying_M] that the marginal of this probability measure on [formula] for 1  ≤  M'  <  M is also given by a hyperdeterminantal construction (with the kernel K replaced by a suitable function of 2M' variables) as long as [formula].

If we regard the exchangeable probability measure on ΣL with density pL as the distribution of a point process on Σ, then it is natural to inquire about the distribution of the number of points that fall into a given subset of Σ. We find a relatively simple expression for the factorial moments of such distributions in Section [\ref=S:occupancy].

The key observation behind many of our arguments is an expansion of suitable hyperdeterminants that is analogous to the Cauchy-Binet theorem for ordinary determinants. This result is an extension of a lemma from [\cite=MR1355700], and we give the proof in Section [\ref=S:expansion].

A hyperdeterminant expansion

For M = 1, the following result is a consequence of the Cauchy-Binet expansion for determinants. (Recall our assumption that K is non-empty and so our hyperdeterminant for M = 1 is a determinant rather than a permanent - the Cauchy-Binet expansion for permanents is somewhat different and involves sums over possibly repeated indices.) When M > 1 and [formula], the result is given by Lemma 3.3 of [\cite=MR1355700].

We have

[formula]

where

[formula]

For [formula] and [formula] define an N  ×  N matrix [formula] by

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Note that the rightmost product is zero unless the entries of the vector [formula] are distinct, because in that case each of the matrices [formula] for k∈K will have two equal columns and hence have zero determinant (recall that K is non-empty). Moreover, if [formula] and [formula] are two vectors with distinct entries such that [formula], then

[formula]

and

[formula]

for all k, because permuting the columns of a matrix leaves the permanent unchanged and either leaves the determinant unchanged or alters its sign.

The result now follows, because for any subset L of [formula] with cardinality N there are N! vectors [formula] with [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T:main]

By definition,

[formula]

where [formula] is the 2M-way hypercubic matrix of length N given by

[formula]

and the N  ×  L matrix B(m) is given by

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=P:expansion],

[formula]

where the sum is over all subsets L of [formula] with cardinality N and [formula] is the N  ×  N sub-matrix of the matrix B(k) formed by the columns of B(k) with indices in the set L.

It follows that [formula]. Also, since the value of the permanent a matrix is unchanged by a permutation of the rows and the value of a determinant is either unchanged or merely changes sign, the function pN is unchanged by a permutation of its arguments.

We have

[formula]

where σk and τk in the summations range over bijective maps from [formula] to L and ε is interpreted in the usual way for such a bijection.

Now the integral

[formula]

is equal to 1 if and only if σm(n)  =  τm(n) for 1  ≤  m  ≤  M, and otherwise the integral is 0. Hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

as required.

Varying the order M

Beginning with a suitable kernel [formula], we have a built a family of functions pN, 1  ≤  N  ≤  L, where pN is a probability density on [formula] with respect to the measure [formula]. For 1  ≤  M'  <  M, it is natural to ask about the push-forward of the probability measure corresponding to the density pN by the projection map from [formula] to [formula] given by

[formula]

The answer is given by repeated applications of the following result.

As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:main],

[formula]

where σk and τk in the summations range over bijective maps from [formula] to L.

Observe that the integral

[formula]

is 1 if and only if σM(n)  =  τM(n) for 1  ≤  n  ≤  N (that is, if and only if σM  =  τM), and the integral is 0 otherwise. For each choice of the set L, there are N! choices of the pair of bijections (σM,τM) such that σM  =  τM, and for all of these choices we have, of course, that ε(σM)  =  ε(τM) if M∈K.

It follows that

[formula]

as claimed.

The number of points falling in a set

Write [formula] for a ΣL-valued random variable that has the distribution possessing density pL with respect to the measure [formula]. Given a set C∈A, let [formula], so that JC is a random variable taking values in the set [formula]. The distribution of the random variable JC is determined by the factorial moments [formula], 1  ≤  N  ≤  L.

If we write [formula] for the indicator random variable of the event [formula], then [formula]. By the exchangeability of [formula], we have

[formula]

Suppose now that [formula], with Cm  ⊆  Σm, 1  ≤  m  ≤  M. Then

[formula]

where H(m) is the L  ×  L matrix defined by

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

where H(k)L is the N  ×  N sub-matrix of H(k) with rows and columns indexed by L.

When M = 1 (so we are dealing with a determinantal point process), the last expression is just the trace of the [formula] compound matrix consisting of the minors of H(1) with N rows and columns. This compound matrix has as its eigenvalues all the products of the eigenvalues of H(1) taken N at a time, and so its trace is the sum of all such products. This shows that JC is distributed as the sum of L independent Bernoulli random variables that have the eigenvalues of H(1) as their respective success probabilities - a result that appears in [\cite=MR1989442] [\cite=MR2216966]. We have been unable to find an analogous probabilistic representation for JC for general M.
