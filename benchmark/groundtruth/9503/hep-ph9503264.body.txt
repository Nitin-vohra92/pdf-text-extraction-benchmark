ABSTRACT

We consider one-loop corrections to partial widths of the Z induced by supersymmetric Yukawa interactions that violate R-parity. The precise experimental values of the leptonic Z partial widths bound these Yukawa couplings, with the most interesting constraints being those on couplings involving the τ, since previous constraints on them were very mild.

Of the many possible extensions of the Standard Model (SM), supersymmetry is considered to be one of the most promising candidates and, consequently, a significant amount of theoretical and experimental effort has been devoted to looking for signals of supersymmetry at present and future colliders. In particular, the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) [\cite=mssm] has been the subject of numerous investigations. In addition to the usual particles of the Standard Model, the MSSM contains their superpartners and two Higgs doublets. The gauge structure of the MSSM essentially replicates that of the Standard Model; there is no arbitrariness in the structure of the gauge interactions. This is, however, not true for the Yukawa sector of the MSSM. In addition to the usual Yukawa couplings of the fermions to the Higgs (responsible for the fermion masses), other interactions involving squarks or sleptons are possible.

The relevant part of the superpotential containing the Yukawa interactions involving squarks or sleptons in the MSSM is given in terms of the chiral superfields by

[formula]

where the Li and Qi are SU(2)-doublet lepton and quark fields and the Eci,Uci,Dci are singlet superfields. In general, there are 45 such Yukawa couplings:  9 each of the λ- and λ''- types (because of the antisymmetry in the first (last) two generation indices of the former (latter) couplings) and 27 of the λ'-type. The couplings λ and λ' violate lepton (L) number, whereas the λ'' coupling violates baryon (B) number. The B- and L-violating couplings cannot be present simultaneously, because that would lead to very rapid proton decay. It is possible to forbid the existence of all three interactions in eq.([\ref=e1]) by imposing a discrete symmetry - R-parity. This discrete symmetry may be represented by R = ( - 1)(3B + L + 2S), where S is the spin of the particle, so that the usual particles of the SM have R = 1, while their superpartners have R =  - 1.

The requirement that the MSSM Lagrangian be invariant under R-parity is sufficient to exclude each of the interactions in Eq.([\ref=e1]). There is, however, no compelling theoretical argument in favour of such a symmetry [\cite=rparv]. R-parity conservation is too strong a requirement to ensure proton stability - the latter can simply be ensured by assuming that either the L-violating or the B-violating couplings in Eq.([\ref=e1]) are present, but not both. Relaxing the requirement of R-parity conservation has important implications for supersymmetric particle searches at colliders : a superparticle can decay into standard particles via the R-parity violating couplings in eq.([\ref=e1]).

In this letter we examine the constraints on some of the L-violating λ'-type couplings imposed by precision LEP observables, particularly the Z  →  l+l- partial decay widths. There are new triangle diagrams with Z,l+ and l- external lines involving λ'ijk vertices with i  =   lepton, j  =   quark, k  =   squark indices or i  =   lepton, j  =   squark, k  =   quark indices. Since the magnitude of the new contribution depends on the mass of the fermion in the loop, only λ'i3k-type couplings leading to internal top quark lines can be constrained significantly by our considerations . The constraints we derive require these couplings to be smaller than the SU(2) gauge coupling or the top quark - Higgs Yukawa coupling if the squarks are ~   100 GeV.

We should also recall that there exist important cosmological constraints [\cite=cosm] on R-parity-violating scenarios. Requiring that GUT-scale baryogenesis does not get washed out imposes λ'' <  < 10- 7 generically, though these bounds are model dependent and can be evaded [\cite=dr]. Assuming λ'' = 0, the λ' couplings cannot wash out the initial baryon asymmetry by themselves. However, they can do so in association with a B-violating but (B - L) conserving interaction, such as sphaleron-induced non-perturbative transitions. Since these processes conserve [formula] for each lepton generation, the conservation of any one lepton generation number is sufficient [\cite=nel] to retain the initial baryon asymetry. Therefore, the assumption that the smallest λ'-type coupling is less than ~  10- 7 is enough to avoid any cosmological bound on the remaining λ'-type couplings. Hence, we proceed with a B-conserving but L-violating scenario, assuming λ''  =  0, some theoretical motivations for which can be found in ref. [\cite=hall].

Since we are only interested in the interactions generated by the λ' couplings, we write this part of the Lagrangian out in terms of the component fields. In four-component Dirac notation, the complete set of Lagrangian terms with λ' couplings is given by

[formula]

In our work, we concentrate on computing the one-loop corrections arising due to the interactions in Eq.([\ref=e2]) to the partial widths Z  →  l+l- (where l- and l+ denote a charged lepton and the corresponding antilepton, respectively), because these widths are very precisely determined experimentally. Since the experimental determination of the leptonic width requires knowledge of the hadronic width of the Z, it is important also to know the effect of the λ'i3k couplings on the hadronic channels, for example, Z  →  b In fact, it is clear that the effect on Γb of the i =  lepton, j =  quark (squark), k =  squark (quark) coupling is negligibly small, since this vertex involves leptons in the loop, and hence gives corrections which are, at best, a factor m2τ  /  m2t smaller than the corrections to the leptonic width. But a sizeable correction to Γb can arise due to the i =  slepton, j =  quark, k =  quark vertex, since the corresponding loops involve the top quark.

The tree level Z couplings to the left- and right-handed fermions are given by afL and afR, respectively, which appear in

[formula]

where

[formula]

The Z couplings to the charge-conjugated fermions (fc) are, therefore,

[formula]

The triangle and self-energy diagrams that we need to compute for the correction to the processes Z  →  l+l- and Z  →  b are shown in Figs. 1a and 1b, respectively. We compute these diagrams in terms of the Passarino-Veltman B- and C-functions [\cite=pasvel], corresponding to the two- and three-point integrals. For the purposes of presentation, we give explicit expressions for one diagram of Fig. 1a, viz., the top-induced loop diagram contributing to Z  →  l+l-. It is easy to see that only the coupling of the left-handed leptons to the Z is modified by this diagram, so that the amplitude due to the new contribution is

[formula]

where i  =  1,2,3 and Nc is the colour factor. The Ai's are given by,

[formula]

Here A1,2 denote the contributions from the first and the second triangle diagrams, and the contributions of the two self-energy diagrams are jointly denoted by A3. In A2, we use 24 to distinguish it from the C24 appearing in A1, as the structures of the propagators for the two triangle diagrams are different. In the expression for A2, cd̃ refers to the coupling of the d̃kR-squark to the Z. We point out that the contributions from the individual diagrams are divergent, namely C24 in A1, [formula] in A2 and B1 in A3. But the divergence cancels when these amplitudes are added, and we are left with a finite correction. There is also a finite correction from the other set of triangle and self-energy diagrams in Fig. 1a, calculated analogously to eq.([\ref=e6]) with appropriate modifications. Together these finite parts make a new contribution to the partial width Z  →  l+l-, which we denote by δΓl. We have evaluated the B- and C-functions required using the code developed in ref.[\cite=amit], cross-checking the results by using the standard Feynman parametrisation of the two- and three-point functions and then integrating them numerically.

To provide intuition into our numerical results, we also present analytic expressions valid in the limit [formula], for an arbitrary value of the ratio [formula]. The sum of the Ai's in eq.([\ref=e6]) is given in this limit by

[formula]

where η1,η2 and η3 are given by

[formula]

Eqs (8) and (9) exhibit the expected decoupling in the limit of large [formula], and match qualitatively the exact numerical results presented later even for smaller values of [formula].

We neglect left-right squark mixing, which is expected to be significant only for the t̃ [\cite=elru]. As noted earlier, the diagram that contributes dominantly to δΓl is that with the top quark in the loop, and this diagram contains a b-squark, which justifies our neglect of left-right squark mixing. Similarly, from a computation of the diagrams in Fig. 1b, we obtain a modification to Γb, which we denote by δΓb . We observe that the quantity δΓl is a function of the squark mass, whereas δΓb depends mainly on the slepton mass. Although the squark and slepton masses are completely free parameters phenomenologically, the usual assumption of unification at some Grand Unified scale would normally predict the physical slepton masses to be smaller than the squark masses: the low-energy splitting can be calculated exactly by renormalization group evolutions from some initial conditions in specific models. For our purposes, it is a safe approximation to work with the slepton mass equal to half of the squark mass: our results are insensitive to plausible variations from this approximation.

We compute numerically the corrections to the ratio Rl, defined as:

[formula]

Defining the quantities Δf (f = l,b) by

[formula]

one has the following expression for the change in Rl:

[formula]

Using this equation and, since δRl always turns out negative, comparing the 2-σ experimental upper bound on Rl with the corresponding SM prediction, we obtain the maximum allowed value of λ'i3k as a function of the squark mass. We use the following experimental values [\cite=lep]: Re  =  20.850  ±  0.067,Rμ  =  20.824  ±  0.059,Rτ  =  20.749  ±  0.070. The SM predictions for Rl and Rb are 20.786 and 0.2158 respectively for the following choice of input parameters: mt = 175 GeV, mH = 300 GeV and αs = 0.126 [\cite=lep]. The ratio Rl is quite insensitive to these values, so our results do not change much by varying these parameters. Fig. 2 shows the values of [formula] obtained as functions of the squark mass for e, μ and τ final states. We observe that for [formula] GeV, λ'33k  ≤  0.45,λ'23k  ≤  0.56 and λ'13k  ≤  0.63 at the two-standard deviation level. We observe that the previous low energy bound on the coupling λ'133 is much stronger than the one obtained from our analysis, while the rest of our bounds are new, with the exception of those on λ'131 and λ'231. Our bounds could be significantly improved as more data accumulate on the Z-peak. A compilation of our and previous phenomenological bounds on λ'i3k are displayed in Table 1, where, for the sake of consistent comparison with the previous bounds, we also present the constraints we obtain at the one-standard deviation level.

In passing, we note that the above interactions may also affect the SM predictions of the forward-backward charge asymmetries (AlFB), the τ-polarisation asymmetry (Aτ) or the left-right asymmetry (ALR), however, in view of our constraints, the effects are below the experimental sensitivity, as can be inferred from the similarity of the λ'-type R-parity-violating interactions to leptoquark-induced contributions to the same processes [\cite=bes].

Our bounds have implications for sparticle decays in models with R-violation. In the past [\cite=past], sparticle decays into leptons, particularly τ and/or ντ, have been discussed from a phenomenological point of view. Our bounds imply that decays via λ'-type couplings are unlikely to dominate over R-parity conserving decays of heavier sparticles into gauginos, at least if sparticles weigh ~  100 GeV. Searches for experimental signatures of R-parity violation should therefore focus on decays of the lightest supersymmetric particle, which could still be rapid enough to occur inside a detector.

In conclusion: we have considered the effect of the R-parity-violating couplings λ' on the Z partial widths. By studying the effect of the interactions induced by these couplings on the ratio of the hadronic and leptonic widths, we have been able to place reasonably stringent constraints on the couplings λ' as functions of the masses of the squarks and sleptons. The available data allow us to get interesting bounds which are complementary to those previously existing, particularly for interactions involving the τ lepton. Our bounds could be improved significantly with more precise data.
