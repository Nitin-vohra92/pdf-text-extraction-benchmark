Abstract

A progress report on two recent theoretical approaches proposed to understand the physics of irreversible fractal aggregates showing up a structural transition from a rather dense to a more multibranched growth is presented. In the first approach the transition is understood by solving the Poisson equation on a squared lattice. The second approach is based on the discretization of the Biharmonic equation. Within these models the transition appears when the growth velocity at the fractal surface presents a minimum. The effects of the surrounding medium and geometrical constraints for the seed particles are considered. By using the optical diffraction method, the structural transition is further characterized by a decrease in the fractal dimension for this peculiar class of aggregates.

Introduction

Some irreversible fractal aggregates display in nature peculiar structural transitions during their growing processes. Electrochemical deposition experiments [\cite=Fle92] and bacterial colony growth [\cite=Ben92] are two examples of such phenomena. It has been reported that, at a certain threshold distance far from the cluster center, these systems exhibit an intriguing transition from a rather dense to a more multibranched growth of which little is understood.

Besides the classical diffusion limited aggregation for 'regular' fractals (having fractal dimension df  ~  1.7) [\cite=Wit83] [\cite=Ziq95], the Laplacian aggregation model has been proposed which is based on the discretized Laplace equation[\cite=Nie84]

[formula]

with φi,j the potential growth site. However, neither of these simple approaches lead to explain a complex structural transition during irreversible fractal growth.

Two alternative attempts have recently been reported in the literature to understand the physics behind a structural transition in fractal growth. In the first approach, due to Louis et al. [\cite=Lou92] [\cite=Cas93] [\cite=Wan93a], the transition is derived by solving the Poisson equation (on a squared lattice)

[formula]

which becomes dependent on the potential φ at two boundaries, the distance L between them, and a screening length λ.

The second theoretical approach is due to Wang and Canessa [\cite=Wan93b] [\cite=Can93] and is based on the Biharmonic equation in two-dimensional (2D) isotropic defect-free media, namely

[formula]

By discretizing this equation, these authors have shown that a structural transition can also be a consequence of the different coupling of displacements u within the pattern formation.

Both of these approaches describe a similar class of complex topology from different perspectives and on different systems. However, the Poisson and Biharmonic growth models identically relate the growth probability for each site to the local field as

[formula]

These assumptions phenomenologically follow the Laplacian (or dielectric breakdown) model.

It is the aim of this progress report to review the Poisson and Biharmonic approaches. We shall focus on these two model for irreversible fractal aggregates showing up a structural transition and shall consider the effects of the surrounding medium and geometrical constraints for the seed particles. Following recent ideas by Pérez-Rodrguez et al. [\cite=Per94], we shall also shown how the optical diffraction method leads to characterize the structural transition by a decrease in the fractal dimension for this class of aggregates.

The Poisson Growth Model

The origin of screening in the Poisson model lies in the presence of free charges and leads to a rich variety of patterns [\cite=Lou92]. As compared to the Laplacian model of Eq.([\ref=eq:l1]), this model introduces a new length scale, i.e., λ, and a nontrivial dependence on the boundary conditions that are responsible for a structural transition on growing.

Fig.1(a) shows an example of the Poisson model in planar geometry by adding 4051 particles to the cluster and using φi = 5  ×  10- 7, φo = 1 and λ- 1 = 10. From this figure it can be seen that the Poisson patterns obtained can have a fractal character (at scales shorter than λ), to then display a structural transition.

Louis at. [\cite=Lou92] have analytically demostrated that this structural transition can be characterized by a change in the sign of the electrostatic field at the surface of the aggregate besides the minimum of the growth velocity (to be shown later). However, Wan Wei [\cite=Wan93a] has shown that such a transition may be altered by the existence of a critical field.

It is important to note that within the Poisson model several fractal branch might also grow when attaching more than one particle at each computer step. For details see Refs.[\cite=Lou92] [\cite=Cas93].

The Biharmonic Growth Model

Fig.1(b) shows the final stage of a Biharmonic fractal displaying features (in circular geometry) of a transition. Below the transition point [formula], the fractal dimension approaches the value for Laplacian growth within error bars. To generate this class of patterns one solves numerically the Biharmonic Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]). Its discrete form on the (i,j) lattice site, yields the following expression

[formula]

requiring the values of the normal derivative for the order parameter u [\cite=Gde86]. For the sake of simplicity one sets the derivative boundary condition (necessary along the radial direction) equal to zero.

Throughout calculations one uses lattice sites enclosed within a circle of (normalized) radius [formula] such that uo and ui are unity and zero at the outer circular boundary and the inner growing Biharmonic aggregate, respectively. The seed particle can be placed either centered or distributed under different geometrical constraints as discussed later. The procedure for growing fractals then follows standard techniques [\cite=Nie84], till solutions of the discretization of Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]) converge. Aggregates then stochastically grow under the relation between the growth probability P (at the grid site (i,j)) and u as in Eq.([\ref=eq:w2]).

Growth Velocity

Results for the grow velocity v along the y-direction for the Biharmonic model are plotted in Fig.2. For comparison, also included in this figure are the results for Poisson growth assuming v to be proportional to the field |φi,j  -  φi| by following Ref.[\cite=Lou92].

From Fig.2, it can be seen that the structural transition coincides with the fact that v on the growing surface presents a minimum. The same is true for Biharmonic growth (even independently of how one relates the probability Pij to u(i,j) [\cite=Wan93b]). For Laplacian growth this phenomenon does not appear because the trend is to generate a single tip at faster velocity than in the cases of Poisson or Biharmonic growth.

Biharmonic patterns below [formula], ( i.e., within the dense region of Fig.1(b)), does not become that dense as for Poisson of Fig.1(a). This effect can be understood from the velocity plot since for Poisson growth the transition occurs at smaller velocities than for Biharmonic growth. Henceforth, a Eden-like pattern can be generated due to screening. Both Poisson and Biharmonic models lead to growth velocities along the y-direction with parallel slopes.

Effects of Surrounding Medium and Geometrical Constraints

Within the Biharmonic model, the effects on fractal growth of the surrounding medium and of different geometrical constraints (or boundary conditions) for the seed particles has been analysed in Ref.[\cite=Can93] by following the η (or dielectric breakdown) model [\cite=Nie84] [\cite=Mea91] and assuming an extention of Eq.([\ref=eq:w2]) as

[formula]

where the sum runs over nearest neighbor sites and η  ≥  0.

Figure 3(a) shows typical numerical results by using η = 2 for a cluster of about 1000 particles. In the limit η  →    ∞  , a 'transition from slow to faster growth' is found in such a way that one end of the needle-like structure presents greater growth probability than the other. Such structures become dendritic below and above a transition point. On decreasing the value of η, one finds a transition from dendritic-to-compact growth such that the inner region of the aggregates becomes denser. If η  →  0, the growth probability becomes purely random and independent of the Biharmonic field -as in a Eden-like pattern.

The effects of geometrical constraints for the seed particles has also been studied in Ref.[\cite=Can93] by fixing the value of η and using two different geometries for the seed particles, namely circular and linear. Figure 3(b) shows a Biharmonic fractal under the constrains of a circular (empty) area of seed particles. As can be seen a structural transition still survives independently of such a simple configuration adopted.

Optical Diffraction Analysis

The effect of the structural transition on the diffracted intensity and, consequently, on df follows by considering the fractal to be composed of N identical and similarly oriented particles on the plane x - y [\cite=Ber91] [\cite=Kor92]. The position of their centers of mass is given by [formula], where n = 1,...,N. In this system, the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for the fractal is derived by assuming that each particle corresponds to one aperture.

The form factor, corresponding to the intensity scattered by one 'aperture', is determined by the integral of the diffraction amplitude. The structure factor is

[formula]

where k is the component, parallel to the xy-plane, of the scattered wave vector whose modulus is [formula], with θ the (small) angle that the scattered wave vector makes with the z-axis. λ is the wavelength of the incident light. If ka < 1 (a being the size of an elementary particle), the form factor is practically unity and the light distribution in the diffraction pattern is given by the structure factor such that the normalized diffraction intensity is

[formula]

For [formula] (L being the size of the whole aggregate) the expected value of the intensity -or, alternatively, of the structure factor [formula]- is

[formula]

This relation for fractal aggregates obeys a power law behaviour [\cite=Wit83], where the exponent α is related to the Hausdorff dimension df = d - α with d the Euclidean space dimension. This variation, in turn, leads to the power law behavior of the diffracted intensity as a function of the wave vector

[formula]

Information about df can be obtained at low k values (such that [formula]) from the averaged intensity defined by the expression

[formula]

As seen in Fig.4, this quantity for Poisson fractals has a power law behavior as a function of the modulus k. However, the structural transition during fractal growth leads to a change in df. The slopes of this plot represent a decrease of the fractal dimension for Poisson aggregates. Similar results have been found in Biharmonic fractals [\cite=Per94].

Discussion

In both models studied the global influence of a growing pattern to the growth probability for each lattice site under a certain power-law form is set phenomenologically as in Eq.([\ref=eq:w2]) or ([\ref=eq:w22]). However an important difference to note is that within the Biharmonic model, iterative procedures are carried out around thirteen next nearest neighbors and not on four as within the Poisson and Laplacian models. Thus the formation of connected patterns within the Biharmonic equation becomes non trivial and more involved.

Within the Poisson model, screening lies in the presence of free charges. The physical relevance for the Biharmonic equation might follow from elasticity theory (the deflection of a thin plate subjected to uniform loading over its surface with fixed edges), the steady slow 2D motion of a viscous fluid or the vibration modes in the acoustic of drums. Besides this, a higher order differential equation containing the Biharmonic term also appears in the study of kinetic growth with surface relaxation (see, e.g., recent work in [\cite=Yan92] and references therein).

The influence of ramified Biharmonic patterns on the growth probability for each lattice site is on the type of pattern obtained and not on locating the transition. Several branches may also develop within the Poisson and Biharmonic growth models by attaching -simultaneously, and stochastically- more than one particle at each time step. For Poisson growth the structural transition is the result of including many-body contributions via screening in a sort of mean field approach. In the Biharmonic model, long range coupling appears naturally as a consequence of discretizing Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]) (as given in Eq.([\ref=eq:w4])). For planar symmetry, the transition point within both models appears when the growth velocities exhibit a minimum. This implies that Poisson and Biharmonic growth describe a similar class of complex structural transition phenonema from two different perspectives and on different systems.

The structural transition point can, to a good approximation, be estimated from the continuous limit of Eq.([\ref=eq:w1]) in cylindrical coordinates. Canessa and Wang [\cite=Can93] have shown that the transition point depends on the system size L only and occurs approximately at a distance (in lattice units) about 60% far from the seed particle indicated by the circle arrows in Fig.1(b). This prediction is in accord with their numerical simulations for η = 1.

By tuning η  →  0 in Eq.([\ref=eq:w22]), the structural transition corresponds to a 'dense-to-multibranched transition' whereas for η  →    ∞   one founds a 'transition from slow to faster growth'. On decreasing η from infinity to zero, Biharmonic fractals become denser as for Laplacian growth. For large η, the needle-like structures grow faster at one end and, in the overall, remain denditric. Furthermore the transition point is independent of geometrical constrains adopted for the seed particles.

Results of optical diffraction have enabled to identify and relate changes in df of aggregates to variations in the diffracted intensity as a function of the wave vector. Such findings may be experimentally confirmed. In fact, the averaged intensity < I(k) >  might be determined by using the set up as the one described in [\cite=All86]. Therein, a photomultiplier connected to a multichannel analyzer records I(kx,ky) and the displacement of the photomultiplier is controlled by a high-precision motorized micrometer. Then, after scanning the diffraction patterns displaying a structural transition, the average of intensity over concentric circles (< I(k) > ) might be obtained.
