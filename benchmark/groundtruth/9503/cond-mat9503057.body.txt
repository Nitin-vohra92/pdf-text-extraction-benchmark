Introduction

Random Schrödinger operators are differential operators on [formula] formally given by [formula], where Vω is an ergodic (or metrically transitive) random scalar potential. Here [formula] denotes the nabla operator in the d-dimensional Euclidean space [formula] and [formula] is the Hilbert space of Lebesgue square-integrable complex-valued functions on [formula]. These operators have been thoroughly investigated by physicists as well as mathematicians. See [\cite=pafi92], [\cite=cala90] or [\cite=kir89] for reviews of basic concepts and rigorous results. For a more physical point of view see [\cite=shef84], [\cite=ligr88]. The generalization of random Schrödinger operators to non-zero constant magnetic field are operators of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a non-random vector potential such that the magnetic-field tensor (Bjk) given by [formula] is constant. The two-dimensional version of ([\ref=2]) is widely believed to serve as a minimal model for the integer quantum Hall effect [\cite=sto92], [\cite=javi94], [\cite=beel94] and has therefore been intensively investigated by physicists, see for instance [\cite=anfo82], [\cite=kume88], [\cite=sto92], [\cite=javi94].

Only recently rigorous studies of the spectral properties of random operators of the form ([\ref=2]) have appeared [\cite=mapu92], [\cite=mat93], [\cite=brhu93], [\cite=uek94], [\cite=wan94], [\cite=cohi94], [\cite=doma95a], [\cite=doma95b], [\cite=brhuPREP], but see also the related earlier work [\cite=gus77]. The self-averaging property of the integrated density of states has been established under fairly general conditions and various of its asymptotic properties have been considered. Also the existence of localized states has been proven [\cite=cohi94], [\cite=doma95a], [\cite=doma95b].

In this note we are concerned with the Schrödinger operator ([\ref=2]) in two dimensions with a Poisson random potential determined by a non-negative single-site potential U, decaying algebraically at infinity. That is,

[formula]

where pω(j) are random points in the Euclidean plane [formula] distributed in accordance with Poisson's law. We will show how rigorous versions of results in [\cite=brhe89] and [\cite=brhe91] can be used to find the leading asymptotic behaviour of the integrated density of states as the energy approaches the infimum of the spectrum from above.

In the zero-field case the asymptotic behaviour changes its character depending on the decay of the single-site potential at infinity. For slow decay it is governed solely by the potential energy [\cite=pas77], that is, by classical effects. For rapid decay the kinetic energy also becomes relevant leading to genuine quantum effects. The form of the latter asymptotic behaviour has been discovered by Lifshitz [\cite=lif64], [\cite=lif67], [\cite=ligr88]. Convincing arguments for the validity of Lifshitz' conjecture were given by Friedberg and Luttinger [\cite=frlu75], [\cite=lut76]. Its rigorous proof [\cite=dova75], [\cite=nak77], [\cite=pas77] relies on Donsker's and Varadhan's involved large-deviation results [\cite=dova75], [\cite=dest89] about the long-time asymptotics of certain Wiener integrals.

For the case of non-zero constant magnetic field we will show that the low-energy tail is always given by the classical result irrespective of the decay of the single-site potential. Basically, this is due to the fact that in this case the ground state of the unperturbed Schrödinger operator H(0) consists of square-integrable functions.

The distance between successive eigenvalues of H(0), commonly referred to as Landau levels, and the degeneracy per area of each eigenvalue increase linearly with the strength of the magnetic field. For a fixed concentration of non-interacting electrons and sufficiently strong field it is therefore physically reasonable to investigate only the restriction E0H(Vω)E0 to the eigenspace [formula] of the lowest Landau level instead of the full Schrödinger operator H(Vω). For a rigorous discussion of this point see [\cite=mapu92], [\cite=brhu93], [\cite=brhuPREP]. Remarkably, Wegner [\cite=weg83] succeeded in calculating the corresponding restricted integrated density of states for the case of a delta-correlated Gaussian random potential. A rigorous version of this derivation is given in [\cite=mapu92]. Wegner's result was quickly extended to general delta-correlated random potentials by Brézin, Gross and Itzykson [\cite=brgr84], including Poisson potentials, the single-site potential of which being a Dirac delta function. The calculation in [\cite=brgr84] relies on the resummation of a suitable representation of an averaged Neumann series. A non-perturbative derivation was given by Klein and Perez [\cite=klpe85].

We will show that the restriction to any Landau level does not alter the leading asymptotic behaviour of the integrated density of states at the lower spectral boundary for algebraically decaying single-site potentials. This behaviour is in sharp contrast to that for delta-correlated Poisson potentials, where it can happen that the integrated density of states is not continuous at the infimum of the spectrum.

Although we will only discuss the two-dimensional case, our result generalizes to even dimensions and a non-degenerate magnetic-field tensor, that is, to the case where the magnetic-field tensor (Bjk) is constant and has full rank.

Statement of the Result

We will assume throughout that the random potential Vω is the Poisson random potential [\cite=pafi92] with concentration ρ  >  0 and non-negative single-site potential [formula], where U decays algebraically and integrably at infinity, that is

[formula]

In addition, for technical reasons we cannot allow for too strong local singularities. Therefore we will assume besides ([\ref=2.1]) either

[formula]

or, more restrictively,

[formula]

In the sequel we suppose B > 0 and the vector potential

[formula]

given in the symmetric gauge. Then the Schrödinger operator ([\ref=2]) is almost surely essentially self-adjoint on [formula] provided ([\ref=2.1]) and ([\ref=2.2a]) hold. This follows from [\cite=cyfr87] and the fact that [formula] for all [formula] almost surely because of Remark [\ref=2-1-v)]. On account of gauge equivalence [\cite=lei83], with the choice ([\ref=7]) there is no loss of generality for the description of a constant magnetic field.

The spectral resolution of the unperturbed part dates back to Landau [\cite=lan30] and is given by

[formula]

where the eigenvalues [formula] are called Landau levels and the corresponding infinite-dimensional eigenprojectors En are integral operators with kernels given by

[formula]

Here Ln is the n-th Laguerre polynomial [\cite=grry80].

The explicit formula for the integral kernel of En shows that [formula]. Since [formula] is stable under convolution, this implies that [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] is dense in [formula], because [formula] is dense in [formula]. Taking finally into account, that the mapping ([\ref=5b]) is almost surely polynomially bounded, we conclude that the Schrödinger operator restricted to the eigenspace of the n-th Landau level, in symbols [formula], and all its natural powers [formula], [formula], are almost surely well-defined non-negative operators from [formula] to [formula].

As for the essential self-adjointness of EnH(Vω)En on [formula], we were not able to prove it under the assumptions ([\ref=2.1]) and ([\ref=2.2a]). However, under the stronger assumptions ([\ref=2.1]) and ([\ref=2.2b]) a proof can be taylored along the lines given in the proof of Theorem 2.1 in [\cite=doma95a]. By appealing to Nelson's analytic-vector theorem [\cite=resi75] and to the fact that [formula] contains a countable dense subset it suffices to check that

[formula]

for all [formula] and some t > 0. We start by observing that there is a constant cn(B) such that

[formula]

for all [formula]. Moreover, by an iterated version of Hölder's inequality and translation invariance one has

[formula]

for all [formula]. Copying now the steps between Equations (2.15) and (2.20) in [\cite=doma95a] our estimates ([\ref=2.9b]), ([\ref=2.9c]) and ([\ref=2.4a]) yield for all [formula]

[formula]

As a consequence, ([\ref=2.9a]) is valid for all [formula].

In the following we are allowed and will understand the unrestricted operators H(Vω) and the restricted operators EnH(Vω)En as being almost surely essentially self-adjoint on [formula] under the imposed assumptions ([\ref=2.1]), ([\ref=2.2a]) and ([\ref=2.1]), ([\ref=2.2b]), repectively.

Let [formula] denote the projection-valued measure for the self-adjoint operator X. Here Θ is Heaviside's unit-step function: Θ(a) = 0 for a < 0 and Θ(a) = 1 for a  ≥  0. Our objects of study, the integrated density of states N and the n-th restricted integrated density of states Rn, are defined by

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively. Our aim is to identify the asymptotics of N(λ) and Rn(λ) as λ approaches the lower spectral boundary, that is, [formula] or [formula], respectively. By employing the so-called magnetic translations [\cite=zak64], [\cite=klpe85], see Equation ([\ref=A.18]) below, standard arguments [\cite=kima82], [\cite=kir89] show that both H(Vω) and EnH(Vω)En are ergodic families of operators [\cite=uek94], [\cite=wan94], [\cite=cohi94], [\cite=doma95a], [\cite=brhuPREP]. Therefore, their spectra are non-random quantities, see [\cite=uek94], [\cite=kima82] or [\cite=kir89]. It will turn out that [formula] and [formula] as expected. Our result is the following.

Proof

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=2-3] we follow the strategy in [\cite=pas77]. Instead of N(λ) we investigate its Laplace transform and use a Tauberian argument [\cite=pafi92]. Since H(Vω) is bounded below by [formula], this argument shows that ([\ref=15]) is equivalent to

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the shifted Laplace transform of N. Analogously we define

[formula]

to be the shifted Laplace transform of Rn. Then ([\ref=15a]) is equivalent to ([\ref=17]) with [formula] replacing [formula].

To establish the leading asymptotic behaviour of [formula] and [formula] for large t we use the following The Basic Inequalities provide us with asymptotically coinciding upper and lower bounds for the shifted Laplace transforms [formula] and [formula].

[formula]

Therefore we have

[formula]

On the right-hand side of ([\ref=25]) we substitute x  ↦  (μt)1 / αx and use Fatou's lemma to interchange the limit and the integration. Since

[formula]

by ([\ref=2.1]), we conclude

[formula]

Note that this is also true with [formula] replacing [formula], because the different prefactors in the upper bounds ([\ref=20]) and ([\ref=22]) coincide asymptotically. to 18pt 9pt height 9pt depth 0pt

[formula]

With the help of the substitution x  ↦  (μt)1 / αx this yields

[formula]

where we have introduced the one-parameter family [formula] of probability densities on [formula]

[formula]

The Fourier representation

[formula]

which may be verified with the help of [\cite=grry80], shows that δt approximates Dirac's delta function as t  →    ∞  . Therefore one can check

[formula]

using ([\ref=26]) and the fact that U is both integrable and square-integrable. According to Fatou's lemma this suffices for the validity of

[formula]

To obtain the same estimate with [formula] replacing [formula] one only has to specialize to n = 0 and to note that the differing prefactors in ([\ref=19]) and ([\ref=21]) become both irrelevant on the logarithmic scale. to 18pt 9pt height 9pt depth 0pt

Proofs of the Basic Inequalities

The proofs of the bounds ([\ref=19]) and ([\ref=20]) for [formula] rely on an approximation formula, which will be presented first.

[formula]

where μt,y0,x denotes the probability measure associated with the two-dimensional Brownian bridge from b(0) = x to b(t) = y. Here the potentials' part of the Euclidean action is given by

[formula]

Since the Brownian bridge is a continuous semimartingale [\cite=pro92], the Itô stochastic line integral in ([\ref=A.5]) is well-defined [\cite=pro92].

In [\cite=brhu94] it is proven that the right-hand side of ([\ref=A.3]) is jointly continuous in (t,x,y), t > 0, [formula], and we will get as a by-product in the proof of ([\ref=20]) below that [formula] is of trace class. Thus [\cite=kat84] we may write

[formula]

where we have performed the rigid shift b  ↦  b + x. Due to the translation invariance of Vω we get with the help of Itô's formula [\cite=pro92]

[formula]

where

[formula]

Since by Vω  ≥  0 one has

[formula]

the theorem of dominated convergence is applicable and yields

[formula]

Employing again the Feynman-Kac-Itô formula, for Ω = 0, the continuity of the involved integral kernels and the translation invariance of the random potential, one achieves by ([\ref=10]) and ([\ref=18])

[formula]

which concludes the proof of ([\ref=A.2]). to 18pt 9pt height 9pt depth 0pt

[formula]

Then [formula] is nothing but the standard overcomplete family of coherent states associated with the Heisenberg-Weyl group generated from the ground state of a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. Since [formula] is almost surely of trace class whenever t,Ω > 0, we may write, see [\cite=ber71] or [\cite=sim80]

[formula]

Since [formula] is almost surely essentially self-adjoint on [formula] and [formula], the Jensen-Peierls inequality [\cite=ber72], [\cite=sim79b] implies

[formula]

Due to the translation invariance of the random potential, we get by inserting ([\ref=A.14]) into ([\ref=A.13]) after some calculation

[formula]

With the help of ([\ref=A.2]) this proves ([\ref=19]). to 18pt 9pt height 9pt depth 0pt

[formula]

Therefore, we can use the Golden-Thompson inequality in the version given in the Corollary to [\cite=resi78] to conclude that [formula] is almost surely of trace class and its trace is bounded from above by the squared Hilbert-Schmidt norm ([\ref=A.16]). Taking the expectation with respect to the random potential, this shows

[formula]

Using ([\ref=A.2]) once again, ([\ref=20]) is proven. to 18pt 9pt height 9pt depth 0pt

As a preliminary to the proofs of ([\ref=21]) and ([\ref=22]) we show that the n-th restricted integrated density of states Rn is independent of [formula]. This is achieved with the help of the unitary magnetic-translation operator Wx defined by

[formula]

because on the one hand the eigenprojectors En are left invariant under its action, that is

[formula]

and on the other hand the potential is simply shifted

[formula]

Using these properties together with the translation invariance of the random potential, the right-hand side of ([\ref=11]) is seen to be independent of [formula]. For a complete discussion of the magnetic-translation group associated with H(0) see [\cite=zak64], [\cite=klpe85].

[formula]

for the shifted Laplace transform of the n-th restricted integrated density of states. Since [formula] and EnVωEn is almost surely essentially self-adjoint on [formula], we may use the Jensen-Peierls inequality [\cite=ber72], [\cite=sim79b] and the fact that Enφn  =  φn to estimate

[formula]

The insertion of ([\ref=A.22]) into ([\ref=A.21]) completes the proof of ([\ref=21]). to 18pt 9pt height 9pt depth 0pt

For the proof of ([\ref=22]) we will use again an approximation formula which we single out as

[formula]

Here we have introduced

[formula]

As a next step we claim that for all [formula] and almost all ω

[formula]

in the strong resolvent sense. Since [formula] is almost surely essentially self-adjoint on [formula] for all r > 0 and so is the right-hand side of ([\ref=A.27]), it is sufficient [\cite=resi80] to check that for all [formula] and almost all ω

[formula]

Since En is bounded and maps [formula] into itself, this follows from

[formula]

for all [formula], [formula]. The last inequality is due to the estimate [formula] and its right-hand side vanishes as r  →    ∞  , because the mapping ([\ref=5b]) is almost surely polynomially bounded.

The strong resolvent convergence ([\ref=A.27]) now implies [\cite=resi80] together with ([\ref=A.21])

[formula]

From [formula] one has

[formula]

almost surely. Therefore one can use the dominated-convergence theorem, ([\ref=A.30]) and ([\ref=A.25]) to obtain ([\ref=A.24]). to 18pt 9pt height 9pt depth 0pt

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

is of trace class, because it is the product of a trace-class operator and a norm-convergent sum [\cite=resi80]. Thus we have

[formula]

due to the continuity of the integral kernel [\cite=kat84], see Remark [\ref=2-2-iii)].

Analogously to the arguments in the proof of ([\ref=21]) we may rewrite the integrand in the approximation formula ([\ref=A.24]) as a scalar product, use the Jensen-Peierls inequality and in a next step the Jensen inequality together with [formula] to show

[formula]

Thanks to ([\ref=A.35]), ([\ref=A.34]) and the approximation formula ([\ref=A.24]) can be combined to yield the preliminary estimate

[formula]

Finally, we use the Jensen-Peierls inequality in the version of Berezin [\cite=ber72], [\cite=sim79b], which implies

[formula]

This is justified, since both [formula] and [formula] are almost surely essentially self-adjoint on [formula], [formula] is dense in [formula] and because the right-hand side is well-defined. The latter can be seen by an argument analogous to that at the beginning of this proof employing [formula]. Due to the continuity of the integral kernel of [formula] we are allowed [\cite=kat84] to calculate

[formula]

To finish the proof of ([\ref=22]), we only have to insert ([\ref=A.37]) into ([\ref=A.38]) and perform the limit with the help of ([\ref=A.38]). to 18pt 9pt height 9pt depth 0pt
