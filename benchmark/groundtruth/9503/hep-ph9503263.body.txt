Of the ideas that take us beyond the standard model (SM), supersymmetry is perhaps the most extensively discussed. As the name suggests, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is obtained by the naive supersymmetrization of both the SM particle content and the couplings [\cite=mssm]. Furthermore, an additional Higgs supermultiplet has to be included both for anomaly cancellation as well as for fermion mass generation. A new feature arises at this juncture. Since the SU(2)-doublet lepton superfields have the same gauge quantum numbers as one of the higgs supermultiplets, the latter can be replaced by the former in any or all of the Yukawa interaction terms. One may also write trilinear terms involving the SU(2)-singlet quark supermultiplets. The additional pieces in the superpotential may thus be parametrized as [\cite=rpar]

[formula]

where Li and Qi are the SU(2)-doublet lepton and quark superfields and Eci,Uci,Dci are the singlet superfields. Clearly λijk is antisymmetric under the interchange of the first two indices, while λ''ijk is antisymmetric under the interchange of the last two.

It is obvious that the presence of such terms can alter phenomenology to a great degree. For example, while the first two terms in eq.([\ref=R-parity]) violate lepton number, the last one violates baryon number. The simultaneous presence of both sets can, therefore, lead to a catastrophically high rate for proton decay. This and other such issues have provoked the introduction of a discrete symmetry known as "matter parity" or equivalently, "R-parity". Representable as R  =  ( - 1)3B  +  L  +  2S, where B,L,S are the baryon number, lepton number and the intrinsic spin of the field respectively, R has a value of + 1 for all SM particles and - 1 for all their superpartners. This symmetry rules out each of the terms in eq.([\ref=R-parity]), with the additional consequence that the lightest superpartner (LSP) must be stable.

While an exact R-parity is a sufficient condition for the suppression of certain unobserved processes, the theoretical motivation for such a symmetry is not clear. This makes the question of establishing phenomenological bounds on R-violating couplings an interesting one. This issue is of paramount importance in the context of the search for supersymmetric particles in the forthcoming colliders. Even a tiny R-parity-violating ([formula]) coupling can totally change the expected signatures.

The constraints imposed by the non-observance of proton decay can be circumvented by assuming that all of λ''ijk are zero. Such a scenario might be motivated within certain theoretical frameworks [\cite=hall-suzuki], and we implicitly assume the same in the rest of this note. This assumption also renders simpler the problem of preservation of GUT-scale baryogenesis [\cite=baryo]. Although the presence of the other [formula]  terms can also affect the baryon asymmetry of the universe, Dreiner and Ross [\cite=dreiner] have argued that such bounds are highly model-dependent and can hence be evaded. For example, in cases where at least one L-violating coupling involving a particular lepton family is small enough ([formula]) so as to (almost) conserve the corresponding lepton flavour over cosmological time scales, such bounds are no longer effective.

In what follows, we focus our attention only on the λ'-type L-violating Yukawa interactions. Bounds on individual λ'-type couplings have been derived from limits on the Majorana mass of νe, by demanding charge-current universality in various decays and also from analyses of atomic parity violation, forward-backward asymmetry in e+e- collisions, deep inelastic scattering etc. A comprehensive study can be found in refs.[\cite=barger]. However, while many of the λ'-type couplings are constrained to be [formula] for a common sfermion mass ([formula]) of 100 GeV, the existing low-energy bounds on some of them are still relatively weak. Additionally, LEP data on the Zl couplings have been used to derive some bounds on λ'i3k (~  0.5 for   =  100 GeV) [\cite=gg].

As far as λ'i2k are concerned, constraints exist for only some of them and these are not very stringent either. Derived mainly from three classes of experiments : (i) νμ-induced deep inelastic scattering, (ii) forward-backward asymmetry in e+e- collisions and (iii) atomic parity violation and eD asymmetry, the bounds range between 0.22-0.45 (for   =  100 GeV) at the 1σ level. It has been suggested in ref.[\cite=grt] though that the presence of λ'1jk would induce, at the one-loop level, a Majorana mass for νe. The upper bound on the latter could then be used to place stringent limits on λ'1jk (and similarly on λ1jk too). Such arguments, if correct, would also hold, to a lesser extent, for λ2jk and λ'2jk as well. However, a look at the Lagrangian in eqns.([\ref=R-parity],[\ref=lambda-pr]), shows that this constraint is applicable only for j  =  k, and not for the general case as suggested in ref.[\cite=grt]. The only relevant bound from νe mass on λ'i2k is then that on λ'122 which is now constrained to be [formula] (at 1σ) for   =  100 GeV. Bounds on λ'31k and λ'32k are, as yet, non-existent.

In this short note we attempt to improve the above situation. On the one hand, experimental data on the observed decays of D-mesons are utilized to place bounds on λ'i2k, on the other, τ-decays are used to constrain λ'31k. While some of these are new too, the others are at least comparable to those existing in the literature, and, in most cases, supplant them.

To keep the discussion simple, we shall confine ourselves to semi-leptonic decays, and there too to final states containing only a single meson. From eq.([\ref=R-parity]), the relevant part of the Lagrangian can be written (in terms of the component fields) as

[formula]

As is evident, the above [formula] couplings manifest themselves only when the two non-spectator quarks form an SU(2)L doublet. As an explicit example, we discuss the particular decay D+  (c)  →  (s)  μ+νμ. The presence of the above interaction introduces an additional quark level diagram (involving the exchange of a squark, say R as a particular case) having the current structure

[formula]

A Fierz reordering in eq.([\ref=rp-current]) takes it back to the SM current structure and, adding the two contributions, the effective current looks like

[formula]

It is easy to see that at the quark level, all the decays (whether of mesons or of the τ) meeting the above-mentioned criteria can be described by an effective four-fermion interaction similar to that in eq.([\ref=effective]). There now remains to calculate the branching fractions and compare these to the experimental results. However, there exists a small complication in the case of D-decays. The hadronic matrix elements involved in these decays can be parametrized in terms of a few form factors (two for D  →  Klν and four for D  →  K*lν). Although these may be calculated to some degree of accuracy in various models [\cite=bsw], the theoretical errors involved are still somewhat large. The straightforward approach of using each decay channel separately should thus be avoided till these form factors are known better, say from calculations on the lattice [\cite=lattice]. A better method, in this case, is to compare the partial widths into electron and muon channel respectively (keeping the mesons the same). Since the lepton masses are negligible compared to the scale of the problem, we may safely ignore the q2-evolution of the form factors. These no longer appear in the ratio of the experimental widths which thus gives a direct bound on the relative deviation due to the [formula]  interaction. Although the process of combining observables involves compounding different experimental errors, this is more than offset by the deliverance from the theoretical uncertainties. One should also bear in mind the possibility that the sizes of the [formula] couplings in the electronic and the muonic sector are similar and hence the effects might cancel each other. However, the data on FCNC processes already constrain the products of different couplings to be very small. We shall then work under the (reasonable) assumption that at most one of these couplings is non-zero. For τ-decays, no such considerations are necessary. As the pion decay constant fπ is relatively well-measured, we may compare the theoretical expression for the decay τ  →  πντ with the experimentally determined partial width to obtain our bounds on λ'31k.

For the numerical computation we use the following experimental inputs [\cite=pdg]

[formula]

and

[formula]

The constraints that we derive are summarized in Table 1. The bounds on λ'121 and λ'123 are already quite competitive with the ones existing in the literature. These are going to improve even further once the D-branching fractions are known to a better accuracy. On the other hand, for λ'221, our numbers are already better than the existing constraints. On the five couplings, λ'222,λ'223 and all λ'31k, our method places phenomenological bounds for the first time.

To summarise, we use the data on D- and τ-decays to constrain some of the λ'-type [formula] couplings within the MSSM. D-decays constrain λ'12k and λ'22k, while τ-decay constrains λ'31k. Bounds obtained on λ'121 and λ'123 are at par with the existing ones, while those obtained on λ'221 are already better. Further improvements can be expected from two sources : (i) an increase in the experimental accuracies, and/or (ii) a better determination of form factors involved in D-decays enabling us to use each decay channel as an independent input rather than use only their ratios. The most significant constraints that we have derived are those on λ'222, λ'223 and λ'31k. All of these bounds are new from the phenomenological standpoint. With this analysis, only one set of lepton-number violating [formula] couplings, namely λ'32k remains relatively unconstrained. This gap would, most likely, be difficult to fill from low-energy experiments, with rare D-decays perhaps being the best hope!
