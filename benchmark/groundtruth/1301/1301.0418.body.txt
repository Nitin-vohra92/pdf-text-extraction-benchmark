Can quintessence and phantom cause the late time acceleration of the Universe?

Introduction

The accelerated expansion of the Universe at late stages of its evolution, found little more than a decade ago [\cite=SN1] [\cite=SN2], is one of the most intriguing puzzles of modern physics and cosmology. Recognition of this fact was the awarding of the Nobel Prize in 2011 to Saul Perlmutter, Adam Riess and Brian Schmidt. After their discovery, there were numerous attempts to explain the nature of such acceleration. Unfortunately, there is no satisfactory explanation so far (see, e.g., the state of art in [\cite=stateofart]). According to the recent observations [\cite=7WMAP] [\cite=9WMAP], the ΛCDM model is the preferable one. Here, the accelerated expansion is due to the cosmological constant. However, there is a number of problems associated with the cosmological constant. Maybe, one of the main of them consists in the adjustment mechanism which could compensate originally huge vacuum energy down to the cosmologically acceptable value and to solve the coincidence problem of close magnitudes of the non-compensated remnants of vacuum energy and the energy density of the Universe at the present time [\cite=Dolgov]. On the other hand, it is well known that perfect fluids with the equation of state parameters ω <  - 1 / 3 can also cause the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Such fluids are called quintessence [\cite=quintess1] [\cite=quintess2] [\cite=quintess3] and phantom [\cite=phantom1] [\cite=phantom2] for - 1 < ω < 0 and ω <  - 1, respectively. Therefore, they can be an alternative to the cosmological constant. It is of interest to investigate the viability of these models.

In our Letter, we consider the compatibility of these models with scalar perturbations of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metrics at late stages of the Universe evolution. We explore a simplified model with a constant equation of state parameter ω  =   const. We demonstrate that, first, these fluids must be clustered (i.e. inhomogeneous) and, second, ω =  - 1 / 3 is the only parameter which is compatible with the theory of scalar perturbations. Therefore, this quintessence neither accelerates nor decelerates the Universe. We also obtain formulas for the nonrelativistic gravitational potential created by a system of inhomogeneities (galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies). We show that due to the quintessence, the physically reasonable expressions take place for flat, open and closed Universes. If quintessence is absent, the hyperbolic space is preferred [\cite=EZcosm1]. Hence, quintessence can play an important role.

The Letter is structured as follows. In Sec. 2, we consider scalar perturbations in the Friedmann Universe filled with the cosmological constant, pressureless dustlike matter (baryon and dark matter) and quintessence/phantom fluids. Here, we get the equation for the nonrelativistic gravitational potential. In Sec. 3, we find solutions of this equation for an arbitrary system of inhomogeneities for flat, open and closed Universes. These solutions have the Newtonian limit in the vicinity of inhomogeneities and are finite at any point outside inhomogeneities. The main results are summarized in concluding Sec. 4.

Scalar perturbations of FRW Universe

Homogeneous background.

To start with, we consider a homogeneous isotropic Universe described by the FRW metrics

[formula]

where

[formula]

If quintessence is absent (ε0 = 0), then we reproduce the formula obtained in [\cite=EZcosm1]. On the other hand, the expression ([\ref=3.12]) shows that for ε0 > 0  →  λ2 + 1  >  4, quintessence enhances the screening of the gravitating mass. For a many-particle system, the total gravitational potential takes the form

[formula]

where li denotes the geodesic distance between the i-th mass mi and the point of observation. Similarly, using Eq. ([\ref=3.11]), we can write the expression for the total potential in the case of the spherical space.

Taking into account that the averaged total truncated potential has again the form ([\ref=3.10]), the procedure of averaging leads to the physically reasonable result: [formula].

Concerning the case λ2 < 0, the truncated gravitational potential is finite in the limit χ  →    +    ∞  . However, the procedure of averaging does not exist here. Therefore, this case is not of interest for us.

To conclude this section, we discuss briefly the case λ2 = 0. For K = 0, - 1, the principle of superposition is absent now. To make the gravitational potential finite at any point including the spatial infinity, we need to cutoff it smoothly at some distances from each gravitating mass. If K = 0, then quintessence is absent and this case was described in detail in [\cite=EZcosm1]. It was shown that the averaged gravitational potential is not equal to zero. This is a disadvantage of such models. In the case K =  + 1, the principle of superposition can be introduced due to the finiteness of the total volume of the Universe. Here, the comoving averaged rest mass density can be split as follows: [formula]. Then, Eq. ([\ref=2.20]) can be solved separately for each combination [formula]. As a result, the gravitational potential of the i-th mass is

[formula]

This potential is convergent at any point χ  ≠  0, including χ  =  π. It is not difficult to see that [formula]. Therefore, the total averaged gravitational potential is also equal to zero: [formula].

Conclusion

In our Letter, we have investigated the role of quintessence and phantom field for the Universe at late stages of its evolution. It is well known that these fields can be an alternative to the cosmological constant explaining the late time acceleration of the Universe. It happens if their parameter of the equation of state ω <  - 1 / 3. To check the compatibility of these fluids with observations, we consider our Universe at scales much less than the cell of homogeneity size which is approximately 150 Mpc. At such distances, our Universe is highly inhomogeneous and the averaged Friedmann approach does not work here. We need to take into account the inhomogeneities in the form of galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies. All of them perturb the FRW metrics.

To clarify the role of quintessence and phantom, we endowed the Universe with these fluids with a constant equation of state parameter ω. We have shown that quintessence and phantom are compatible with the theory of scalar perturbations if they satisfy two conditions. First, these fluids must be clustered (i.e. inhomogeneous). Second, the parameter of the equation of state ω should be - 1 / 3. Therefore, this quintessence neither accelerates nor decelerates the Universe.

Then, we have obtained the equation for the nonrelativistic gravitational potential. We have shown that due to quintessence the physically reasonable solutions take place for flat, open and closed Universes. The presence of quintessence helps to resolve the Seeliger paradox [\cite=Norton] for any sign of the spatial curvature parameter K. If quintessence is absent, the hyperbolic space is preferred [\cite=EZcosm1]. Hence, quintessence can play an important role. Quintessence is concentrated around the inhomogeneities and results in screening of the gravitational potential.
