Introduction

In his thesis, Lacasse introduced the functions ξ(n) and ξ2(n) in the study of the PAC-Bayesian machine learning theory, where

[formula]

Based on numerical verification, Lacasse presented the following conjecture.

For any integer n  ≥  1, there holds

[formula]

Recently, by applying the Hurwitz identity on multivariate Abel polynomials, Younsi [\cite=Younsi] gave an algebraic proof of this conjecture. Later, using a decomposition of triply rooted trees into three doubly rooted trees, Chen, Peng and Yang [\cite=Chen] gave it a nice combinatorial interpretation.

In this note, using the derangement polynomials and their umbral representation, we provide another simple proof of ([\ref=eqn_1.1]).

The derangement polynomials and the proof of ([\ref=eqn_1.1])

Recall that the derangement polynomials {Dn(λ)}n  ≥  0 are defined by

[formula]

where Dn(1) = n! and Dn(0) = Dn is the n-th derangement number, counting permutations on [formula] with no fixed points. The derangement polynomials Dn(λ), also called λ-factorials of n, have been considerably investigated by Eriksen, Freij and W[formula]stlund [\cite=Eriksen], Sun and Zhuang [\cite=SunZhuang]. The derangement polynomials Dn(λ) have the following basic property [\cite=Eriksen] and an Abel-type formula [\cite=SunZhuang],

[formula]

and obey the recursive relation [\cite=SunZhuang],

[formula]

Denote by [formula] the umbral operator defined by [formula] for n  ≥  0 (See [\cite=Gesselb] [\cite=Roman] [\cite=RomRota] for more information on the umbral calculus), then by ([\ref=eqn_2.1]) Dn(λ) can be represented as

[formula]

Setting λ = 0,μ = n + 1 in ([\ref=eqn_2.4]), we have

[formula]

which proves ([\ref=eqn_1.1]), if one notices that ξ(n) and ξ2(n), by ([\ref=eqn_2.3]), can be rewritten as

[formula]

By the nontrivial property of [formula] [\cite=SunZhuang],

[formula]

one can get another expression for ξ2(n),

[formula]

This expression has been obtained by Younsi using an identity of Hurwitz on multivariate Abel polynomials and plays a critical role in his proof.
