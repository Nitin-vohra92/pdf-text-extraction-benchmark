On [formula]-complete topological semilattices

In this paper all topological spaces will be assumed to be Hausdorff. We shall follow the terminology of [\cite=CHK] [\cite=Engelking1989], and [\cite=GHKLMS]. For a subset A of a topological space X by [formula] we denote the closure of A in X. A filter [formula] on a set S is called free if [formula].

A semilattice is a set endowed with a commutative idempotent associative operation. If E is a semilattice, then the semilattice operation on E determines the partial order [formula] on E: This order is called natural. An element e of a semilattice E is called minimal ( maximal) if [formula] ([formula]) implies f = e for f∈E. A semilattice E is said to be linearly ordered or a chain if the natural order on E is linear.

If S is a topological space equipped with a continuous semigroup operation then S is called a topological semigroup. A topological semilattice is a topological semigroup which is algebraically a semilattice.

Let [formula] be a category whose objects are topological semigroups and morphisms are homomorphisms between topological semigroups. A topological semigroup [formula] is called [formula]-complete if for each object [formula] and a morphism f:X  →  Y of the category [formula] the image f(X) is closed in Y.

By a [formula]-completion of a topological semigroup X we understand any [formula]-complete topological semigroup [formula] containing X as a dense subsemigroup. A [formula]-completion [formula] of X is called universal if each continuous homomorphism h:X  →  Y to a [formula]-complete topological semigroup [formula] extends to a continuous homomorphism [formula].

It is well-known that for the category [formula] of topological groups and their continuous homomorphisms, each object [formula] has a [formula]-completion and each [formula]-completion of G is universal [\cite=Raikov1946].

In the category of topological semigroups the situation is totally different. We show this on the example of the discrete topological semigroups [formula] and [formula]. We shall study [formula]-completions and [formula]-completions of discrete topological semigroup [formula] and [formula] in the category [formula] (resp. [formula]) whose objects are Hausdorff topological semigroups and morphisms are continuous homomorphisms (resp. isomorphic topological embeddings) between topological semigroups.

The notion of [formula]-completion was introduced by Stepp in [\cite=Stepp1969], where he showed that for each locally compact topological semigroup S there exists an [formula]-complete topological semigroup T which contains S as a dense subsemigroup.

Stepp [\cite=Stepp1975] proved that a discrete semilattice E is [formula]-complete if and only if any maximal chain in E is finite. In [\cite=GutikPavlyk2003] Gutik and Pavlyk remarked that a topological semilattice is [formula]-complete ([formula]-complete) if and only if it is ([formula]-complete) as a topological semigroup. In [\cite=GutikRepovs2008] Gutik and Repov studied properties of linearly ordered [formula]-complete topological semilattices and proved the following characterization theorem:

A linearly ordered topological semilattice E is [formula]-complete if and only if the following conditions hold:

E is complete;

x =  sup A for [formula] implies [formula]; and

x =  inf B for [formula] implies [formula].

Also, in [\cite=GutikRepovs2008] Gutik and Repov proved that each linearly ordered [formula]-complete topological semilattice is [formula]-complete and showed that every linearly ordered semilattice is a dense subsemilattice of an [formula]-complete topological semilattice. In [\cite=ChuchmanGutik2007] Chuchman and Gutik proved that any [formula]-complete locally compact topological semilattice and any [formula]-complete topological weakly U-semilattice contain minimal idempotents.

In [\cite=Stepp1975] Stepp asked the following question: Is each [formula]-complete topological semilattice [formula]-complete? In the present paper we answer this Stepp's question in the negative by constructing an example of an [formula]-complete topological semilattice which is not [formula]-complete. Also we construct an [formula]-complete topological semilattice of arbitrary infinite cardinality λ which has 2λ many open-and-closed continuous homomorphic images which are not [formula]-complete topological semilattices.

Let [formula] denote the set of positive integers. For each free filter [formula] on [formula] consider the topological space [formula] in which all points [formula] are isolated while the sets [formula], [formula], form a neighbourhood base at the unique non-isolated point [formula].

The semilattice operation min  (resp., max ) of [formula] extends to a continuous semilattice operation max  min  (resp., max ) on [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] (resp., [formula]) for all [formula]. By [formula] (resp., [formula]) we shall denote the topological space [formula] with the semilattice operation min  (resp., max ). Simple verifications show that [formula] and [formula] are topological semilattices.

For each free filter [formula] on [formula] the topological semilattices [formula] and [formula] are [formula]-complete.

Each [formula]-completion of the discrete semilattice [formula] (resp., [formula]) is topologically isomorphic to the topological semilattice [formula] (resp., [formula]) for some free filter [formula] on [formula].

The topological semilattice [formula] (resp., [formula]) has no universal [formula]-completion.

(i) By Theorem [\ref=theorem-1], we have that the topological semilattices [formula] and [formula] are [formula]-complete. Since [formula] and [formula] are linearly ordered semilattices, Theorem 3 of [\cite=GutikRepovs2008] implies that the topological semilattices [formula] and [formula] are [formula]-complete.

(ii) We shall prove the statement for the semilattice [formula]. In the case of [formula] the proof is similar.

Let S be an H-complete topological semilattice containing [formula] as a dense subsemilattice. Since the closure of a linearly ordered subsemilattice in a Hausdorff topological semigroup is a linearly ordered topological semilattice (see [\cite=GutikPavlyk2003] and [\cite=GutikRepovs2008]), we conclude that S is linearly ordered and [formula] is a singleton {a}. Then since [formula] is a dense subsemilattice of S, the continuity of the semilattice operation in S implies that a  ·  a = a and a  ·  n = n  ·  a = n for any [formula]. Let [formula] be the filter of neighborhoods of the point a in S. This filter induces the free filter [formula]. Then we can identify the topological semilattice S with [formula] by the topological isomorphism [formula] such that [formula] and f(n) = n for every [formula].

(iii) Suppose the contrary: there exists a universal [formula]-completion S of the discrete semilattice [formula]. Then by statement (ii), the semilattice S can be identified with the semilattice [formula] for some free filter [formula] on [formula]. Let [formula] be any free filter on [formula] such that [formula]. Then the identity embedding [formula] cannot be extend to a continuous homomorphism [formula], witnessing that the [formula]-completion S of [formula] is not universal.

Later on, by E2  =  {0,1} we denote the discrete topological semilattice with the semilattice operation min .

Let [formula] be a free filter on [formula] and [formula] be a set with infinite complement [formula]. Then the following statements hold:

the closed subsemilattice [formula] of the direct product [formula] is [formula]-complete;

the subset [formula] is an open-and-closed ideal in E, and the quotient semilattice E / I with the quotient topology is discrete and not [formula]-complete;

the semilattice E is not [formula]-complete.

(i) The definition of the topological semilattice [formula] implies that E is a closed subsemilattice of [formula].

Suppose the contrary: the topological semilattice E is not [formula]-complete. Since the closure of a subsemilattice in a topological semigroup is a semilattice (see Corollary 19 of [\cite=GutikPavlyk2003]), we conclude that there exists a topological semilattice S which contains E as a dense subsemilattice and [formula]. We fix an arbitrary [formula]. Then for every open neighbourhood U(a) of the point a in S we have that the set [formula] is infinite. By Theorem [\ref=theorem-2], the subspace [formula] of E with the induced semilattice operation from E is an [formula]-complete topological semilattice. Therefore, there exists an open neighbourhood U(a) of the point a in S such that [formula] and hence the set [formula] is infinite.

Next we shall show that a  ·  x = x for any [formula]. Since the set [formula] is infinite, the continuity of the semilattice operation in E implies that a  ·  x = x for any [formula]. Now fix any point [formula]. By the definition of the semilattice operation on E, we can find a point [formula] with xy  ·  y = y and conclude that Since [formula] is a cluster point of the set [formula], the continuity of the semilattice operation implies that [formula].

Since [formula] is a neighborhood of the point [formula], the continuity of the semilattice operation yields the existence of neighborhoods U(a) and [formula] of the points a and [formula] in S such that [formula]. Now choose any point [formula] and find a point [formula] such that m  ≥  n. Then

[formula]

which contradicts the choice of [formula].

(ii) The definition of the semilattice E implies that [formula] is an open-and-closed ideal in E. Then the quotient semilattice E / I (endowed with the quotient topology) is a discrete topological semilattice, topologically isomorphic to the discrete semilattice [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=theorem-1], the semilattice E / I is not [formula]-complete.

Statement (iii) follows from statement (ii).

For a free filter [formula] on [formula], each closed subsemilattice of the semilattice [formula] is [formula]-complete if and only if [formula] is the filter of cofinite sets on [formula].

(⇐) If [formula] is the filter of cofinite sets on [formula], then the space [formula] is compact. Then each closed subset of [formula] is compact and hence each closed subsemilattice of the semilattice [formula] is [formula]-complete.

(  ⇒  ) If [formula] is a free filter on [formula] containing a set [formula] with the infinite complement [formula], then [formula] is a closed subsemilattice of the topological semilattice [formula] and Theorem [\ref=theorem-3] implies that E is not [formula]-complete.

The proof of the following theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem-3] with some simple modifications.

Let [formula] be a free filter on [formula] and [formula] be a set with infinite complement [formula]. Then the following assertions hold:

the closed subsemilattice [formula] of the direct product [formula] is [formula]-complete;

the subset [formula] is an open-and-closed ideal in E, and the quotient semilattice E / I with the quotient topology is discrete and not [formula]-complete;

the semilattice E is not [formula]-complete.

The proof of the following corollary is similar to the proof of Corollary [\ref=corollary-4] and follows from Theorem [\ref=theorem-5].

For a free filter [formula] on [formula], each closed subsemilattice of the semilattice [formula] is [formula]-complete if and only if [formula] is the filter of cofinite sets on [formula].

We remark that Theorems [\ref=theorem-3] and [\ref=theorem-5] give negative answers on Question 17 from [\cite=Stepp1975].

Also, Theorems [\ref=theorem-3] and [\ref=theorem-5] imply the following corollary:

There exists a countable locally compact [formula]-complete topological semilattice E with an open-and-closed ideal I such that I is an [formula]-complete semilattice and the Rees quotient semigroup E / I with the quotient topology is not [formula]-complete.

Let λ be any infinite cardinal and let 0∉λ. On the set [formula] endowed with the discrete topology we define the semilattice operation by the formula:

Let [formula] be a free filter on [formula] and [formula] be a set with infinite complement [formula]. Then for each infinite cardinal λ the following statements hold:

the closed subsemilattice [formula] of the direct product [formula] is [formula]-complete;

for each subset κ  ⊂  λ the subset [formula] is an open-and-closed ideal in E, and the quotient semilattice E / Iκ with the quotient topology is discrete and not [formula]-complete;

the semilattice E is not [formula]-complete.

(i) Assuming that the topological semilattice E is not [formula]-complete, find a topological semilattice T containing E as a dense subsemilattice with non-empty complement [formula]. Fix any element [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=theorem-1], the topological semilattice [formula] is [formula]-complete and hence is closed in T. Then there exists an open neighbourhood U(e) of the point e in T such that [formula]. By the continuity of the semilattice operation in T, there exists an open neighbourhood V(e)  ⊆  U(e) of the point e in T such that V(e)  ·  V(e)  ⊆  U(e). By Theorem [\ref=theorem-5], for each a∈λ, the subsemilattice [formula] of the direct product [formula] is [formula]-complete and hence is closed in T. This implies that [formula] for infinitely many points a∈λ, and hence [formula]. This contradicts the choice of the neighbourhood U(e). The obtained contradiction implies that the topological semilattice E is [formula]-complete.

(ii) The definition of the semilattice E implies that [formula] is an open-and-closed ideal in E. Then we have that the quotient semilattice E / Iκ with the quotient topology is a discrete topological semilattice. Also, E / Iκ is topologically isomorphic to the orthogonal sum of λ infinitely many of [formula] with isolated zero. This implies that the semilattice E / Iκ is not [formula]-complete.

Statement (iii) follows from statement (ii).

The topological semilattices E, and Iκ from Theorem [\ref=theorem-11] are metrizable locally compact spaces for each free countably generated filter [formula] on [formula] and any κ  ⊂  λ.

Since for each subset κ  ⊂  λ the natural homomorphism π:E  →  E / Iκ is an open-and-closed map, Theorem [\ref=theorem-11] implies the following corollary:

Let [formula] be a free filter on [formula] containing a set [formula] with infinite complement [formula]. Then for each infinite cardinal λ there exist 2λ many continuous open-and-closed surjective homomorphic images of the topological semilattice [formula], which are not [formula]-complete.
