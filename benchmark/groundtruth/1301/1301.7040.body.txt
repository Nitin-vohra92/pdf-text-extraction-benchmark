Positive temperature versions of two theorems on first-passage percolation

Introduction

Let [formula] be a random Schrödinger operator on [formula] with non-negative potential V  ≥  0:

[formula]

Assume that the entries of V are independent, identically distributed, and satisfy

[formula]

The inverse G  =  H- 1 of H defines a random metric

[formula]

on [formula] (see Lemma [\ref=l:bound.infty] below for the verification of the triangle inequality). We are interested in the behaviour of ρ(x,y) for large [formula] (here and forth [formula] stands for the [formula] norm); to simplify the notation, set ρ(x)  =  ρ(0,x).

Zerner proved [\cite=Z], using Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem [\cite=Ki], that if V satisfies ([\ref=eq:not0]) and

[formula]

then

[formula]

where [formula] is a deterministic norm on [formula] determined by the distribution of V. As to the fluctuations of ρ(x), Zerner showed [\cite=Z] that ([\ref=eq:not0]), ([\ref=eq:z.moment]), and

[formula]

imply the bound

[formula]

In dimension d = 1, the bound ([\ref=eq:z]) is sharp; moreover, ρ obeys a central limit theorem

[formula]

which follows from the results of Furstenberg and Kesten [\cite=FK]. In higher dimension, the fluctuations of ρ are expected to be smaller: the exponent

[formula]

is expected to be equal to 1 / 3 in dimension d = 2, and to be even smaller in higher dimension.

These conjectures are closely related to the corresponding conjectures for first-passage percolation. In fact, ρ is a positive-temperature counterpart of the (site) first-passage percolation metric corresponding to ω  =   log (1 + V); we refer to Zerner [\cite=Z] for a more elaborate discussion of this connection.

The rigorous understanding of fluctuations in dimension d  ≥  2 is for now confined to a handful of integrable models (see Corwin [\cite=C] for a review); extending it beyond this class remains a major open problem. We refer to the works of Chatterjee [\cite=Ch] and Auffinger-Damron [\cite=AD1] [\cite=AD] for some recent results.

Here we carry out a much more modest task: verifying that the bounds on the fluctuations in (bond) first-passage parcolation due to Talagrand [\cite=T] and Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm [\cite=BKS] are also valid for the random matric ([\ref=eq:def.rho]). Zerner's bound ([\ref=eq:z]) is a positive-temperature counterpart of Kesten's estimate [\cite=K]. Kesten showed that the (bond) first-passage percolation [formula] satisfies

[formula]

furthermore, if the underlying random variables have exponential tails, then so does [formula]. Talagrand improved the tail bound to

[formula]

Benjamini, Kalai, and Schramm [\cite=BKS] proved, in dimension d  ≥  2, the sublinear bound

[formula]

for the special case of Bernoulli-distributed potential. Benaïm and Rossignol [\cite=BR] extended this bound to a wider class of distributions ("nearly gamma" in the terminology of [\cite=BR]), and complemented it with an exponential tail estimate. Extensions of the Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm bound to other models have been found by van der Berg and Kiss [\cite=vdBK], and by Matic and Nolen [\cite=MN].

Theorem [\ref=thm:fluct] below is a positive temperature analogue of Talagrand's bound (with a slightly stronger conclusion under a slightly stronger assumption - mainly, to use a more elementary concentration inequality from [\cite=T0] [\cite=T] instead of a more involved one from [\cite=T]), and Theorem [\ref=thm:bks] - of the Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm bound. The strategy of the proof is very close to the original arguments; the modification mainly enters in a couple of deterministic estimates. Set [formula].

Suppose the entries of V are independent, identically distributed, and bounded from below by ε  >  0. Also assume that the entries of V are bounded from above by 0  <  M  <    ∞  . Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

for every t  ≥  0.

Assume that the distribution of the potential is given by

[formula]

for some 0  <  a  <  b, and that d  ≥  2. Then

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:fluct]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:fluct] is based on Talagrand's concentration inequality [\cite=T0] [\cite=T]. We state this inequality as

Assume that [formula] are independent random variables, the distribution of every one of which is supported in

[formula]

Denote g(x)  =  G(0,x). To apply Lemma [\ref=l:radek], we first compute the gradient of log g, and then estimate its norm.

For any [formula],

[formula]

Let Py  =  δyδ*y be the projector on the y-th coordinate. Set Hh  =  H  +  hPy, Gh  =  H- 1h. By the resolvent identity

[formula]

hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

Our next goal is to prove

Suppose V  ≥  ε  >  0. Then

[formula]

where Aε depends only on ε.

The proof consists of two ingredients. The first one, equivalent to the triangle inequality for ρ, yields an upper bound on every term in ([\ref=eq:l2]).

For any [formula],

[formula]

Let Hy be the operator obtained by erasing the edges that connect y to its neighbours, and let Gy  =  H- 1y. By the resolvent identity,

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

The second ingredient is

For any [formula],

[formula]

The proof of Lemma [\ref=l:7.5] requires two more lemmata. Denote

[formula]

For any [formula],

[formula]

and

[formula]

The first formula follows from the relation Hg  =  δ, and the second one - from the relation Hg2  =  g.

Set [formula].

For any [formula],

[formula]

For x  ≠  0, ([\ref=eq:relg]) and the concavity of logarithm yield

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq:relg]) once again, we obtain

[formula]

The argument is similar for x  =  0.

Let A  ≥   log - 1(1 + ε). Then from Lemmata [\ref=l:equ] and [\ref=l:convlog] the function [formula] satisfies

[formula]

By a finite-volume approximation argument,

[formula]

whence

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=l:bound.infty] ,

[formula]

The inequality V  ≥  ε implies G(y,y)  ≤  Aε'', and Lemma [\ref=l:7.5] implies

[formula]

Next, we need

For any [formula], log g(x), [formula], and [formula] are convex functions of the potential. Consequently,

[formula]

is a concave function of the potential.

The first statement follows from the random walk expansion:

[formula]

where the sum is over all paths [formula]. Indeed, for every w

[formula]

is a convex function of V, hence also [formula] is convex.

To prove the second statement, observe that

[formula]

where G0 is obtained by deleting the edges adjacent to 0. Therefore

[formula]

for every y, log G0(y,x) is a convex function of V, hence so is [formula].

Denote ρ0(x)  =   min (ρ(x),μ(x)). Then by Lemma [\ref=l:deriv] and Proposition [\ref=p:bound.2]

[formula]

Aε depends only on ε. By Lemma [\ref=l:conv], ρ0 is concave, therefore by Lemma [\ref=l:radek]

[formula]

Similarly, set ρt(x)  =   min (ρ(x),μ(x)  +  t). Then

[formula]

therefore

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:bks]

The proof follows the strategy of Benjamini, Kalai, and Schramm [\cite=BKS]. Without loss of generality we may assume that [formula]; set [formula].

Let

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the ball of radius m about the origin. According to Lemma [\ref=l:bound.infty],

[formula]

therefore ρ(x)  ≤  F  +  Ca,bm; similarly, ρ(x)  ≥  F  -  Ca,bm. It is therefore sufficient to show that

[formula]

We use another inequality due to Talagrand [\cite=T1] (see Ledoux [\cite=L] for a semigroup derivation). Let X be a (finite or countable) set. Let σ+x:{a,b}X  →  {a,b}X be the map setting the x-th coordinate to b, and σ-x:{a,b}X  →  {a,b}X -the map setting the x-th coordinate to a. Denote

[formula]

For any function f on {a,b}X,

[formula]

Let us estimate the right-hand side for f  =  F, [formula]. Denote

[formula]

then

[formula]

According to Lemma [\ref=l:deriv],

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

For any [formula] and any [formula],

[formula]

Let us first conclude the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:bks] and then prove the lemma. Set [formula], and let

[formula]

Then the contribution of coordinates in A to the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq:tal]) is at most [formula] by Lemma [\ref=l:7.5]. For y in the complement of A, Lemma [\ref=l:bks] yields

[formula]

hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

by the inequality #  B  ≥  Cm2 (which holds with d-independent C). The contribution of the complement of A to ([\ref=eq:tal]) is therefore at most [formula]. Thus finally

[formula]

For [formula] and [formula], set

[formula]

Similarly to Lemma [\ref=l:equ],

[formula]

By a finite-volume approximation argument, it is sufficient to prove the estimate ([\ref=eq:lbks]) in a finite box. Then max xuQ(x',x) is attained for some xmax∈Q. By symmetry, max x',xuQ(x',x) is attained when both x' and x are in Q. On the other hand, for x',x∈Q

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=l:7.5].
