Introduction and motivation

As is well known, the remainder term

[formula]

in the Taylor expansion of the complex exponent satisfies the precise inequality

[formula]

with equality attained as [formula], i. e. the factor 1 / n! on the r.-h. side of [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorApproxFromManuals] cannot be made less. Nevertheless, this does not mean that inequality [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorApproxFromManuals] is unimprovable. Indeed, in 1991 H. Prawitz [\cite=Prawitz1991] suggested to rearrange a part of the remainder (however, always a smaller part) to the main term and proved that:

[formula]

with equality still attained as [formula], whence [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorApproxFromManuals] immediately follows.

The advantage of bound [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorApproxPrawitz] as compared with [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorApproxFromManuals] becomes especially noticeable, if x is an integration variable. For example, in probability theory x may stand for the product tX of an arbitrary random variable (r.v.) X defined on some probability space [formula] and an argument [formula] of its characteristic function (ch.f.)

[formula]

which is the Fourier-Stieltjes transform of the function of bounded variation F(x) (the distribution function of the r.v. X). Namely, suppose that for some [formula]

[formula]

and denote

[formula]

[formula]

Then, by virtue of the Jensen inequality, [formula], [formula]. Moreover, αn may vanish for odd n, for example, for any symmetric distribution (i.e., if the r.v.'s X and ( - X) have identical distributions), whereas βn may be infinitely large.

As it follows from [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorApproxFromManuals],

[formula]

with equality attained at any degenerate distribution as [formula], i.e. the factor 1 / n! on the r.-h. side of [\eqref=ChFTaylorExpApproxFromManuals] cannot be made less. However, by use of inequality [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorApproxPrawitz], Prawitz managed to replace the absolute moment βn by the linear combination of |αn| and βn with coefficients still summing up to one:

[formula]

whence [\eqref=ChFTaylorExpApproxFromManuals] immediately follows by virtue of Jensen's inequality. Prawitz also paid a special attention to the case n = 3, which is very important in the problem of estimation of the accuracy of the normal approximation to normalized sums of independent random variables with finite third moments, and in the same paper [\cite=Prawitz1991] noted that the coefficient

[formula]

at β3 on the r.-h. side of [\eqref=ChFTaylorExpApproxPrawitz] cannot be less than

[formula]

Inequality [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorApproxPrawitz] stipulates natural questions: if a larger part of the remainder is rearranged to the main term, will the factor (n + 2) / (2(n + 1)!) on the r.-h. side of [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorApproxPrawitz] become less or not? If yes, then what is its least possible value and will the sum of the coefficients at the corresponding main term and remainder still be equal to one or will it increase? To answer these questions, we propose to consider the functions

[formula]

(although here the supremum over x > 0 can be replaced by the supremum over all [formula], [formula], we will use a less cumbersome variant), which guarantee the validity of the inequality

[formula]

Eliminating the real or the imaginary part in the definition of qn(λ) we observe that

[formula]

Replacing the supremum sup x > 0 in the definition of qn(λ) by the limit [formula] we also notice that

[formula]

for all [formula], hence we will consider only the interval [formula]. Inequality [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorApproxPrawitz] implies that

[formula]

Define

[formula]

[formula]

i. e. λ* is the greatest value of λ that minimizes the sum λ + qn(λ), and [formula] is the least value of λ that minimizes qn(λ). Then, actually, only λ∈[null] are of interest. Inequality [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorApproxPrawitz] also implies that

[formula]

and the posed questions can be re-formulated as follows:

[formula]

Moreover, using the introduced functions it is easy to obtain the following estimates for Rn(t) and its derivatives, which improve [\eqref=ChFTaylorExpApproxPrawitz].

For any r.v. X with the characteristic function f(t) and [formula] for some [formula], for all [formula] and [formula] the following estimates hold:

[formula]

[formula]

In lemmas [\ref=LemComplexExpTaylorApprox_n=3], [\ref=LemComplexExpTaylorApprox_n=2], [\ref=LemComplexExpTaylorApprox_n=1] below, it will be demonstrated that for n = 1,2,3

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] [formula] are, respectively, the unique roots of the equations

[formula]

[formula]

i. e. the functions λ + qn(λ) are constant (and equal to one) within the intervals [formula], increase strictly monotonically for [formula], and the functions qn(λ) decrease strictly monotonically for [formula] and attain their minimum values at λ  =  λ*(n), n = 1,2,3. In addition, in lemmas [\ref=LemComplexExpTaylorApprox_n=3], [\ref=LemComplexExpTaylorApprox_n=2], [\ref=LemComplexExpTaylorApprox_n=1] below it will be proved that

[formula]

i. e., actually, for n = 1,2,3 inequalities [\eqref=ComplexExpTaylorMyApprox_qLowBound] hold with the equality sign. In other words, say, for n = 3 one can eliminate the imaginary part of (eix - 1 - ix - (ix)2 / 2 - λ(ix)3 / 6) when searching the supremum in the definition of q3(λ) by choosing a special value of λ  =  λ*(3):

[formula]

Note that the estimates for Rn(t) and its derivatives

[formula]

implied by theorem [\ref=ThChFTaylorExpApprox] for n = 1,2,3 are precise in the sense that equalities in [\eqref=ChFTaylorExpApprox_n=3]-[\eqref=ChFTaylorExpApprox_n=1] are attained for each [formula] at the symmetric three-point distributions of the form [formula] (for which f(t) = 1 - t2θ- 2(1 -  cos θ), α1  =  α3 = 0, α2 = 1, β1 = |t| / θ, β3  =  θ / |t|) with θ  =  θ*3 in [\eqref=ChFTaylorExpApprox_n=3], θ  =  π in [\eqref=ChFDer1TaylorExpApprox_n=3], and θ  =  θ*1 in [\eqref=ChFDer2TaylorExpApprox_n=3], [\eqref=ChFTaylorExpApprox_n=1].

The following theorem allows to get rid of the third moment α3 in [\eqref=ChFTaylorExpApprox_n=3]-[\eqref=ChFDer2TaylorExpApprox_n=3] with [formula], [formula], [formula] being fixed.

For all [formula] and any r.v. X with [formula], [formula], [formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

with equality attained for each [formula] at the two-point distribution

[formula]

Moreover, the function A(b) is concave and increases strictly monotonically varying within the limits [formula], [formula]. The function bA(b), [formula], is concave as well.

Theorem [\ref=Th_|alpha3|<=beta3] improves Jensen's inequality, which states that [formula]: actually, this ratio is strictly less than one for all distributions with zero mean and only tends to one as the normalized third moment β3  /  β3 / 22 goes to infinity.

Theorems [\ref=ThChFTaylorExpApprox] and [\ref=Th_|alpha3|<=beta3] imply

For all [formula] and any r.v. X with [formula], [formula], [formula] the following inequalities hold for all [formula]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

moreover, the functions bγn(b), γn(b), n = 1,2,3, are concave and increase strictly monotonically in [formula], γn(b) varying within the limits

[formula]

The values of the functions γn(b), n = 1,2,3, for some [formula] are presented in columns 2, 5, 8 of table [\ref=TabChFgamma_n(b)+lambda_n(b)] [\ref=n=123]. In columns 3, 6, 9, the values of λn  =  λn(b) are specified, that deliver minimum in the definition of γn(b), and in columns 4, 7, 10 the values of qn = qn(λn(b)) are presented as well.

The problem of estimation of the accuracy of the approximation of characteristic functions by polynomials was also considered in [\cite=Rozovsky1985].

Note that the estimates given in corollary [\ref=CorChFTaylorExpApproxNOalpha3] are rather rough either for large t, or for large b. However, this defect can be corrected if the characteristic function f(t) is approximated by its derivatives (and the derivatives -- by the characteristic function). Namely, the following estimates can be derived from corollary [\ref=CorChFTaylorExpApproxNOalpha3] and the results of [\cite=KorolevShevtsova2010SAJ] [\cite=Shevtsova2012ShapeBias] which are obtained with the application of the zero biased and shape biased transformations:

[formula]

for all [formula] and any r.v. X with [formula], [formula], [formula]. Note that the r.h.-sides of the last inequalities remain bounded for large t as well as for large b.

The presented estimates for characteristic functions allow to sharpen substantially the Berry-Esseen inequality and its structural improvements (see, e.g., the recent works [\cite=Shevtsova2006] [\cite=Tyurin2009DAN] [\cite=Tyurin2010TVP] [\cite=KorolevShevtsova2010DAN1] [\cite=KorolevShevtsova2010DAN2] [\cite=KorolevShevtsova2009] [\cite=Tyurin2009arxiv] [\cite=Tyurin2010UMN] [\cite=KorolevShevtsova2010SAJ] [\cite=Shevtsova2010DAN_0.56] [\cite=KorolevShevtsova2010TVP] [\cite=Tyurin2011] [\cite=Shevtsova2011arxiv] and references in [\cite=KorolevShevtsova2009] [\cite=KorolevShevtsova2010SAJ]), non-uniform estimates of the accuracy of the normal approximation to distributions of sums of independent r.v.'s (see [\cite=Paditz1977] [\cite=Michel1981] [\cite=Tysiak1983] [\cite=Paditz1986] [\cite=NefedovaShevtsova2012] [\cite=NefedovaShevtsova2011DAN] and references therein), as well as uniform and non-uniform moment-type estimates of the rate of convergence in limit theorems for compound and mixed compound Poisson distributions (see [\cite=Michel1993] [\cite=KorolevShorgin1997] [\cite=KorolevShevtsova2010DAN2] [\cite=KorolevShevtsova2010SAJ] [\cite=NefedovaShevtsova2011DAN]).

Proofs

The following lemmas establish the properties of the functions qn(λ) and give the exact values of the quantities λ*(n), λ*(n), for n = 3 (lemma [\ref=LemComplexExpTaylorApprox_n=3]), n = 2 (lemma [\ref=LemComplexExpTaylorApprox_n=2]), and n = 1 (lemma [\ref=LemComplexExpTaylorApprox_n=1]).

Let [formula] be the unique root of the equation

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Let

[formula]

For [formula] by θ3(λ)∈(0,2π) denote the unique root of the equation

[formula]

and θ3(λ) = 0 for [formula]. Then θ3(λ*) = θ*3, q3(λ) = 1 - λ for [formula] and

[formula]

Moreover, the function λ + q3(λ) is strictly increasing for [formula], the function q3(λ) is strictly decreasing for [formula]. In particular,

[formula]

Denote

[formula]

[formula]

Then h(x,λ) > 0, f(x,λ) > 0 for all x > 0, and

[formula]

From a result of [\cite=Prawitz1991] it follows that [formula], hence, for all [formula]

[formula]

Since [formula] [formula], we conclude that q3(λ) = 1 - λ, θ3(λ) = 0 for all [formula].

Now consider 3 / 8 < λ < 1 / 2. For all x > 0 we have

[formula]

[formula]

Evidently, [formula] by the definition of θ3(λ). Split the domain x > 0 into the non-overlapping intervals [formula], [formula] where

[formula]

and consider the function f(x) and its derivatives on each of these intervals. The function cos x has the zeros π / 2 + 2πm and 3π / 2 + 2πm in the interval x∈(0,2π] + 2πm, which might be the zeros of the function f2'''(x) as well. However,

[formula]

for all [formula], thus all the roots of the equation f2'''(x) = 0 coincide with those of the function g(x), if [formula]. Now consider three cases for possible values of λ∈(3 / 8,1 / 2):

if 3 / 8 < λ < 3 / 7, then the function g(x) vanishes in the points x1∈(0,π / 2) + 2πm and x2∈(π,3π / 2) + 2πm changing its sign from +   to -  . Since cos x1 > 0, cos x2 < 0, the function f2'''(x) changes its sign on each of the intervals x∈(0,2π] + 2πm, [formula] only in the two points x1∈(0,π / 2) (from +   to -  ) and x2∈(π,3π / 2) (from -   to +  ).

if λ = 3 / 7, then f2'''(x) = λx2 cos x changes its sign in the two points: x1  =  π / 2 + 2πm (from +   to -  ) and x2 = 3π / 2 + 2πm (from -   to +  ).

if 3 / 7 < λ < 1 / 2, then the function g(x) vanishes in the points x1∈(π / 2,π) + 2πm and x2∈(3π / 2,2π) + 2πm changing its sign from -   to +  . Since cos x1 < 0, cos x2 > 0, the function f2'''(x) changes its sign on each of the intervals x∈(0,2π] + 2πm, [formula] only in the two points x1∈(π / 2,π) + 2πm (from +   to -  ) and x2∈(3π / 2,2π) + 2πm (from -   to +  ).

Summarizing what was said above we conclude that on each of the intervals x∈(0,2π] + 2πm, [formula] the function f2'''(x) changes its sign exactly in two points x1∈(0,π) + 2πm (from +   to -  ) and x2∈(π,2π) + 2πm (from -   to +  ). Thus, x1 is the point of maximum and x2 is the point of minimum of the function

[formula]

We have

[formula]

[formula]

hence, f2''(x1) > 0, f2''(x2) < 0, and f2''(x) changes its sign exactly in two points x3∈(x1,π) + 2πm  ⊂  (0,π) + 2πm (from +   to -  ) and x4∈(π,2π) + 2πm (from -   to +  ).

Thus, the function

[formula]

has exactly two stationary points on each of the intervals (0,2π] + 2πm, [formula]: x3∈(0,π) + 2πm which is the point of maximum and x4∈(π,2π) + 2πm which is the point of minimum. For m = 0 we have f2'(0) = 0, f2'(2π) =  - λ(2π)2 < 0, consequently, f2'(x3) > 0, f2'(x4) < 0, and the function f2'(x) changes its sign in a unique point x6∈(0,2π) (from +   to -  ). For [formula] we have

[formula]

[formula]

consequently, f2'(x3) > 0, f2'(x4) < 0, and f2'(x) changes its sign exactly in two points y5∈(0,π) + 2πm (from -   to +  ) and y6∈(π,2π) + 2πm (from +   to -  ).

Thus, the function

[formula]

has a unique stationary point x6 on the interval (0,2π] which is the point of maximum and exactly two stationary points on each of the intervals (0,2π] + 2πm with [formula]: y5∈(0,π) + 2πm which is the point of minimum and y6∈(π,2π) + 2πm which is the point of maximum. Since

[formula]

we conclude that f2(x6) > 0 and the function f1'(x) = 2x2f2(x) changes its sign on the interval (0,2π] in a unique point x8∈(x6,2π)∈(0,2π) (from +   to -  ). With [formula] we have

[formula]

and hence, the function f1'(x) = 2x2f2(x) changes its sign exactly in two points on each of the intervals (0,2π] + 2πm, [formula]: y7∈(y5,3π / 2) + 2πm∈(0,3π / 2) + 2πm (from -   to +  ) and y8∈(3π / 2,2π) + 2πm (from +   to -  ).

Thus, the function

[formula]

where h(x) > 0, has a unique stationary point x8 on the interval (0,2π] (the point of maximum), and exactly two stationary points on each of the intervals (0,2π] + 2πm with [formula]: y7∈(0,3π / 2) + 2πm (the point of minimum) and y8∈(3π / 2,2π) + 2πm (the point of maximum). Since

[formula]

the function f'(x) has a unique zero within the interval (0,2π), which is the point of maximum of the function f(x) and coincides with θ3(λ).

As regards the domain x > 2π, we are going to prove that f1(x) < 0 for all x > 2π and [formula], implying that the function f(x) has no maxima for x > 2π and completing the proof of the relation q3(λ) = 6f(θ3(λ),λ). Since the function f1(x) has a unique point of maximum y8∈(3π / 2,2π) + 2πm on each of the intervals (0,2π] + 2πm, [formula] it suffices to prove that f1(x) < 0 for all x∈(3π / 2,2π) + 2πm.

Note that cos x > 0, sin x < 0 for x∈(3π / 2,2π) + 2πm = (0,π / 2] + 3π / 2 + 2πm, and hence for [formula]

[formula]

moreover, as it can be easily seen, λ*x4 - 18x2 + 36 > 0, x2(λ* + 1) - 12 > 0 for all

[formula]

Split the domain x∈(0,π / 2] + 3π / 2 + 2πm into two intervals: x∈(0,π / 4) + 3π / 2 + 2πm and x∈[π  /  4,π  /  2] + 3π / 2 + 2πm and examine the function f1(x) on each of them. For x∈(0,π / 4) + 3π / 2 + 2πm we have [formula], [formula] and thus

[formula]

Since [formula], now it can be easily seen that f1(x) < 0 for all

[formula]

in particular, for [formula]

For x∈[π  /  4,π  /  2] + 3π / 2 + 2πm we have [formula], [formula] and thus

[formula]

for all [formula], since the discriminant [formula] is negative.

Thus, we have proved that the function f(x) = f(x,λ) attains its maximal value for x > 0 at the unique point x = θ3(λ)∈(0,2π) for [formula] and at the point [formula] for [formula].

Now prove that q3(λ*) = 6κ3. With

[formula]

(two last relations following from lemma [\ref=LemPrawitsCos3]), we have

[formula]

By virtue of the uniqueness of the root θ3(λ) of the equation f1(x) = 0, which is equivalent to f'x(x,λ) = 0 within the interval (0,2π), we conclude that θ3(λ*) = θ*3 so that

[formula]

Now prove the declared properties of the functions q3(λ), λ + q3(λ). Since

[formula]

the function f(x,λ) is strictly convex in λ for all x∈(0,  ∞  ). As it follows from what was proved, the least upper bound in the definition of q3(λ) is attained for all [formula] at a finite point x = θ3(λ) separated from zero:

[formula]

hence for all λ1,λ2∈(3 / 8,λ*] and [formula] we have

[formula]

i. e. the function q3(λ) is strictly convex for [formula] as well. Since

[formula]

λ  =  λ* being the unique point of minimum of the function q3(λ) on the interval [formula], the function q3(λ) should decrease strictly monotonically for [formula]. For [formula], obviously, the function q3(λ) = 1 - λ is strictly decreasing.

The function λ + q3(λ) is strictly convex for [formula] as a sum of a convex and a strictly convex functions, hence, it cannot be constant on any subinterval of the interval [formula]. On the other hand, [formula] for all [formula], thus, λ + q3(λ) should strictly increase for [formula].

For [formula] let θ2(λ)∈(0,π] be the unique root of the equation

[formula]

and let θ2(λ) = 0 for [formula]. Then θ2(4π- 2) = π, q2(λ) = 1 - λ for [formula] and

[formula]

Moreover, the function λ + q2(λ) is strictly increasing for [formula], the function q2(λ) is strictly decreasing for [formula]. In particular,

[formula]

Denote

[formula]

Then f(x,λ) > 0, x > 0, and

[formula]

From the result of [\cite=Prawitz1991] it follows that [formula], hence, for all [formula]

[formula]

Since [formula] [formula], we conclude that q2(λ) = 1 - λ with θ2(λ) = 0 for all [formula].

Now assume that [formula]. Consider two cases of possible values of x:

0 < x < 2π. We have

[formula]

Obviously, [formula] by the definition of θ2(λ). The function cos x has the zeros π / 2 and 3π / 2 within the interval x∈(0,2π), which might be the zeros of the function f2''(x) as well. However,

[formula]

for all [formula], thus all the roots of the equation f2''(x) = 0 coincide with those of the function g(x), if [formula]. Now consider three cases of possible values of λ∈(1 / 3,4π- 2]:

if 1 / 3 < λ < 2 / 5, then the function g(x) vanishes in some points x1∈(0,π / 2) and x2∈(π,3π / 2) where it changes its sign from +   to -  . Since cos x1 > 0, cos x2 < 0, the function f2''(x) changes its sign only in two points x1∈(0,π / 2) (from +   to -  ) and x2∈(π,3π / 2) (from -   to +  ).

if λ = 2 / 5, then f2''(x) = λx2 cos x changes its sign in two points x1  =  π / 2 (from +   to -  ) and x2 = 3π / 2 (from -   to +  ).

if [formula], then the function g(x) vanishes in some points x1∈(π / 2,π), x2∈(3π / 2,π,2π) where it changes its sign from -   to +  . Since cos x1 < 0, cos x2 > 0, the function f2''(x) changes its sign only in two points x1∈(π / 2,π) (from +   to -  ) and x2∈(3π / 2,2π) (from -   to +  ).

Summarizing what was said above we conclude that the function f2''(x) changes its sign on the interval (0,2π) exactly in two points x1∈(0,π) (from +   to -  ) and x2∈(π,2π) (from -   to +  ). Thus, x1∈(0,π) is the point of maximum and x2∈(π,2π) is the point of minimum of the function

[formula]

We have

[formula]

hence, f2'(x) changes its sign exactly in two points x3∈(0,π) (from +   to -  ) and x4∈(π,2π) (from -   to +  ).

Thus, the function

[formula]

has exactly two stationary points x3∈(0,π) which is the point of maximum and x4∈(π,2π) which is the point of minimum. We have f2(0) = 0, f2(2π) =  - λ(2π)2 < 0, hence, the function f2(x) changes its sign in a unique point x5∈(0,2π) (from +   to -  ), which is the unique point of maximum of the function

[formula]

Since f1(0) = 0, [formula] for all [formula], we conclude that the function f1(x) changes its sign in a unique point x6∈(0,π] (from +   to -  ), which is the unique point of maximum of f(x) and coincides with θ2(λ), since [formula].

[formula]. For [formula] we have

[formula]

[formula]

Summarizing what was said above we conclude that the function f(x) = f(x,λ) attains its maximum value for x > 0 at the unique point x = θ2(λ)∈(0,2π), if [formula], and at the point [formula], if [formula].

Prove that q2(4π- 2) = 2π- 1. Since f'x(x,4π- 2)|x = π = 0, we conclude that θ2(4π- 2) = π by virtue of the uniqueness of the root θ2(λ) of the equation f'x(x,λ) = 0. Hence,

[formula]

Now prove the properties of the functions q2(λ), λ + q2(λ). Since

[formula]

the function f(x,λ) is strictly convex in [formula] for all x∈(0,  ∞  ). As it follows from what has already been proved, the least upper bound in the definition of q2(λ) is attained for all [formula] at the finite point x = θ2(λ) separated from zero:

[formula]

hence for all λ1,λ2∈(1 / 3,4π- 2] and [formula] we have

[formula]

i. e. the function q2(λ) is strictly convex for [formula] as well. Since

[formula]

λ = 4π- 2 being the unique point of minimum of the function q2(λ) in the interval [formula], the function q2(λ) should decrease strictly monotonically for [formula]. For [formula], obviously, the function q2(λ) = 1 - λ is strictly decreasing.

The function λ + q2(λ) is strictly convex for [formula] as a sum of a convex and a strictly convex functions, hence, it cannot be constant on any subinterval of the interval [formula]. On the other hand, [formula] for all [formula], thus, λ + q2(λ) should be strictly increasing for [formula].

Let [formula] be the unique root of the equation x sin x  +   cos x - 1 = 0 within the interval (0,π). Then

[formula]

Consider the function f(x) = (1 -  cos x) / x, x > 0. Since for [formula] we have

[formula]

it suffices only to consider 0 < x < 2π. We have

[formula]

Since [formula], all the zeros of f'(x) within the interval (0,2π) coincide with those of the function g(x) = x -  tan (x / 2). It is easy to see that within the interval (0,2π) the function g(x) vanishes in a unique point x1∈(0,π) changing its sign from +   to -  . Since sin x1 > 0, the function f'(x) has a unique zero within the interval (0,2π), which coincides with θ*1 and delivers maximum to the function f(x).

Let

[formula]

For [formula] let θ1(λ)∈(0,π) be the unique root of the equation

[formula]

and θ1(λ) = 0 for [formula]. Then θ1(λ*) = θ*1, q1(λ) = 1 - λ for [formula] and

[formula]

Moreover, the function λ + q1(λ) is strictly increasing for [formula], the function q1(λ) is strictly decreasing for [formula]. In particular,

[formula]

Denote

[formula]

Then f(x,λ) > 0, x > 0, and

[formula]

Notice that [formula] for all [formula]. From a result of [\cite=Prawitz1991] it follows that [formula], hence, for all [formula]

[formula]

Since [formula] [formula], we conclude that q1(λ) = 1 - λ, θ1(λ) = 0 for all [formula].

Now assume that 1 / 4 < λ < 1 / 3, in particular, [formula]. Consider two cases of possible values of x:

0 < x < 2π. We have

[formula]

Obviously, [formula] by the definition of θ1(λ). Within the interval x∈(0,2π) the function x cos x has the zeros π / 2 and 3π / 2, which might be the zeros of the function f1''(x) as well. However,

[formula]

for all λ < 1 / 3. Hence, all the roots of the equation f1''(x) = 0 coincide with the zeros of the function g(x), for all [formula]. The function g(x) vanishes in the points x1∈(0,π / 2) and x2∈(π,3π / 2) changing its sign from +   to -  . Since cos x1 > 0, cos x2 < 0, the function f1''(x) changes its sign only in two points x1∈(0,π / 2) (from +   to -  ) and x2∈(π,3π / 2) (from -   to +  ). Thus, x1∈(0,π / 2) is the point of maximum and x2∈(π,3π / 2) is the point of minimum of the function f1'(x). We have

[formula]

hence, f1'(x) changes its sign exactly in two points x3∈(0,π) (from +   to -  ) and x4∈(π,2π) (from -   to +  ).

Thus, the function f1(x) has exactly two stationary points x3∈(0,π), the point of maximum, and x4∈(π,2π), the point of minimum. Since f1(0) = 0, f1(2π) =  - λ(2π)2 < 0, the function f1(x) changes its sign in a unique point x5∈(0,2π) (from +   to -  ). Moreover, f1(π) = λπ2 - 4 < π2 / 3 - 4 < 0, hence, x5∈(0,π), x5 delivers maximum to f(x) within the interval (0,2π) and coincides with θ1(λ).

[formula]. For 1 / 4 < λ < 1 / 3 we have

[formula]

[formula]

Summarizing what was said above we conclude that the function f(x) = f(x,λ) attains its maximum value for x > 0 at the unique point x = θ1(λ)∈(0,π), if 1 / 4 < λ < 1 / 3, in particular, if [formula], and at the point [formula], if [formula].

Prove that q1(λ*) = κ1. With

[formula]

(the last relation following from the definition of θ*1 given in lemma [\ref=Lem_sup(1-cos(x))/x]), we have

[formula]

by the definition of θ*1. By virtue of the uniqueness of the root θ1(λ) of the equation f1(x) = 0, which is equivalent to f'x(x,λ) = 0 within the interval (0,2π), we conclude that θ1(λ*) = θ*1 and thus

[formula]

Now prove the properties of the functions q1(λ), λ + q1(λ). Since

[formula]

the function f(x,λ) is strictly convex in λ for all x∈(0,  ∞  ). As it follows from what has been already proved, the least upper bound in the definition of q1(λ) is attained for all 1 / 4 < λ < 1 / 3 at the finite point x = θ1(λ) separated from zero:

[formula]

hence for all λ1,λ2∈(1 / 4,1 / 3) and [formula] we have

[formula]

i. e. the function q1(λ) is strictly convex for 1 / 4 < λ < 1 / 3 as well. Since

[formula]

λ  =  λ* being the unique point of minimum of the function q1(λ) on the interval 1 / 4 < λ < 1 / 3, and thus, the function q1(λ) should decrease strictly monotonically for [formula]. For [formula], the function q1(λ) = 1 - λ is obviously strictly decreasing.

The function λ + q1(λ) is strictly convex for 1 / 4 < λ < 1 / 3 as a sum of a convex and a strictly convex functions, hence, it cannot be constant on any subinterval of the interval 1 / 4 < λ < 1 / 3. On the other hand, [formula] for all [formula], thus, λ + q1(λ) should be strictly increasing for 1 / 4 < λ < 1 / 3, in particular, for [formula].

From the results of [\cite=Hoeffding1955] [\cite=MulhollandRogers1958] it follows that the extremal value of the linear with respect to the distribution function [formula], [formula], functional

[formula]

under the three linear moment-type conditions [formula], [formula], [formula] is attained at a distribution concentrated in at most four points (i. e. the distribution function F(x) being constant almost everywhere and having at most four jumps). For each [formula] there exists a unique two-point distribution which satisfies the conditions [formula], [formula], [formula]. This distribution is given in the formulation of the theorem and turns the stated inequality into equality. Thus, it remains to consider three- and four-point distributions only.

Let X take exactly three different values x,y,z with the corresponding probabilities p,q,r  >  0, p + q + r = 1. Without loss of generality it can be assumed that [formula]. From the conditions [formula], [formula] we find that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

[formula]

The Lagrange function of the optimization problem α3(x,y,z)  →   sup  under the constraint β3(x,y,z) = b has the form

[formula]

In the stationary points we necessarily have

[formula]

Since xz <  - 1 < yz, from these equations we find that

[formula]

whence it follows that λ = 0 by virtue of the conditions [formula]. If λ = 0, then the condition f'x(x,y,z,λ) = 0 implies that yz =  - 1, i. e. p = 0, that contradicts the condition xz <  - 1 < yz and reduces the problem to checking two-point distributions considered above.

Now let X take exactly four values t > u > v > w with the corresponding probabilities p,q,r,s > 0, p + q + r + s = 1. From the conditions [formula], [formula] we find that

[formula]

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Denote [formula]. Then the Lagrange function of the optimization problem α3(s,t,u,v,w)  →   sup  under the constraint β3(s,t,u,v,w) = b has the form

[formula]

For the proof of the theorem it suffices to consider two cases:

1) [formula]. In this case

[formula]

In the stationary points we necessarily have

[formula]

Since p > 0 and t > u > v, the second equation implies that λ =  - 1. With this value of λ the first equation implies that w = 0 contradicting the condition w < 0. Thus, there are no extremal distributions in this case.

2) [formula], u  ≠  v. In this case

[formula]

In the stationary points we necessarily have

[formula]

With the account of the conditions p,q > 0, t > u > v these equations imply λ =  - 1, v = 0. With these values of λ and v we have

[formula]

In the stationary points we necessarily have

[formula]

whence it follows that w = 0 = v contradicting the condition w < v. Thus, there are no extremal distributions in this case as well.

The properties of the function [formula] can be established by examination the derivatives. It is easy to see that

[formula]

i. e. A(b) increases strictly monotonically for all [formula], and

[formula]

decreases monotonically and, hence, attains its maximum value ( - 12) at the point b = 1. Thus, A''(b) < 0 for all [formula], i. e. A(b) is concave. For the function bA(b) we have

[formula]

hence, bA(b) is concave as well.
