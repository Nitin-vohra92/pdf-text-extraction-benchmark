Truncated Conformal Space Approach for Perturbed Wess-Zumino-Witten SU(2)k Models

Introduction

Correlations in one dimensional systems typically require non-perturbative, non-mean field techniques to access the underlying physics. These techniques often trade on low energy, field theoretical reductions of the system. Examples include bosonization [\cite=Bosonization], conformal field theory [\cite=dif], integrable field theory [\cite=Muss], the Bethe ansatz [\cite=BA], and the truncated conformal spectrum approach (TCSA) [\cite=YZ]. The last approach, unlike the aforementioned techniques, is able to deal in principle with any one dimensional field theory in an exact numerical manner. In that sense the TCSA is similar to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [\cite=White], but the framework where it is formulated is field theoretical and not discrete quantum lattice systems.

TCSA deals with models whose Hamiltonians can be represented in the form,

[formula]

where HCFT is the Hamiltonian of some conformal field theory and Φ is an arbitrary perturbation. The approach employs the Hilbert space of the conformal field theory as a computational basis and exploits the ability to compute matrix elements of the perturbing field in this same basis using the constraints afforded by the conformal symmetry. It was first employed by Yurov and Zamolodchikov in studies of massive perturbations of the critical Ising model [\citep=YZI] and the scaling Yang-Lee model [\cite=YZ].

Since its introduction it has been used in a large number of instances and to some degree has become a standard tool. It has been used to study perturbations of the tri-critical Ising [\cite=LMC] [\cite=LTCM], the 3-states Potts model [\cite=L3PM], bosonic (c  =  1) compactified theories [\cite=Fev2], the sine-Gordon model [\cite=Fev3] [\cite=Bajnok], and perturbations of boundary conformal field theories [\cite=Dorey3]. Spectral flows between different conformal field theories were addressed in Ref. [\cite=KlaMe2], while the correctness of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations was checked in Refs. [\cite=Dorey1] [\cite=Dorey2]. Finite-size corrections to the mass spectra have also been analyzed in Refs. [\cite=KlaMe] [\cite=Fev1]. By replacing the conformal field theory with an integrable field theory, the approach can also study models of perturbed integrable field theories. Matrix elements of the perturbing field are then computed in the form factor bootstrap approach [\cite=FonsecaZam].

While the TCSA approach is extremely flexible in the models it can attack, it is in practice limited to perturbations of conformal field theories with small central charge ([formula]). For theories with large central charge, the underlying conformal Hilbert space is large and becomes numerically burdensome to manipulate. The difficulty has recently been partially ameliorated with the development of a numerical renormalization group (NRG) for the TCSA [\cite=NRG] [\cite=NRG1] [\cite=NRG2] [\cite=NRG3] [\cite=NRG4]. This renormalization group permits large Hilbert spaces to be dealt with piecewise making the numerics manageable. Using this renormalization group, the excitonic spectrum of semi-conducting carbon nanotubes was studied [\cite=NRG3] (here the underlying conformal field theory had c = 4) as were large arrays of coupled quantum Ising chains [\cite=NRG1] (here the underlying conformal field theory had c  ~  30 - 50).

The TCSA approach, as designed, focuses on accurately computing the properties of the low energy states. However when combined with an NRG together with a sweeping algorithm not dissimilar to the finite volume algorithm of the DMRG [\cite=White], the TCSA can compute the properties of states over a wide range of energies. This was demonstrated in [\cite=NRG2] where the level spacing statistics were studied in crossing over from an integrable to a non-integrable model.

To the best of our knowledge the TCSA has not been applied previously to perturbations of Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models. WZW models are non-linear sigma models whose field g lives on a group manifold G. They possess topological terms, the Wess-Zumino term, whose action is quantized with the consequence that its coupling constant k is constrained to be a positive integer. The consequence of the topological term is to make the sigma models conformal with the affine Lie algebra associated with G, spectrum generating. Affine Lie algebras typically have richer structure than the Virasoro algebra and are consequently more difficult to treat with the TCSA. Specialized code needs to be developed in order to treat such models. Here we report the development of such code for the study of perturbations of SU(2)k WZW models.

Perturbed SU(2)k WZW models are interesting physically primarily because they are able to represent the low energy structure of spin chains [\cite=AfHal]. The most important example here is the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, whose low energy behavior is governed by SU(2)1 perturbed by a marginally irrelevant current-current interaction. Adding different perturbations to SU(2)1 leads to different variants of the Heisenberg model. The Hamiltonian

[formula]

where φ1 / 2,  ±  1 / 2 are the spin-1/2 fields in SU(2)1, is the low energy reduction of the dimerized J1 - J2 Heisenberg model

[formula]

The couplings of the two models are related via [formula] and [formula]. This model has been studied intensely both field theoretically with RG analyses [\cite=Af1] and with DMRG [\cite=kumar] [\cite=branes]. These methodologies do not currently agree on how the spin gap depends upon the dimerization parameter δ. It is one of the aims of our work to set up the framework under which disputed questions surrounding this model can be addressed.

SU(2)k for k > 1 WZW theories are also of considerable interest as they are the low energy reductions of families of spin-k / 2 spin chains with finely tuned, local interactions [\cite=AfHal]. They have also been shown more recently to represent Haldane-Shastry type spin chains [\cite=hs] with longer range interactions [\cite=cs] [\cite=ncs] [\cite=greiter]. In both cases, it is of interest to understand how SU(2)k WZW behaves in the presence of relevant and marginal perturbations. And more generally, because SU(2)k WZW theories are multicritical with many possible relevant perturbations. Actual spin chains are likely to be realized only in the vicinity of these critical points rather than precisely at them.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section II we present briefly the framework for the TCSA where perturbations of SU(2)k can be studied. In the next three sections we present applications of the TCSA to perturbed SU(2)k models, establishing how the methodology works. In Section III we examine the SU(2)1  +  Tr(g) model, which is equivalent to the sine-Gordon model. This allows us to compare our numerics with known analytic results. In Section IV we study the SU(2)1  +  L  ·  R model, which corresponds to a marginal current-current perturbation of SU(2)1. We show here that one can isolate the UV divergent behavior, essential for extracting the universal behavior of spin chains described by SU(2)k with a marginal perturbation. Finally, in Section V, we consider SU(2)2 perturbed by Tr(g)2. This provides a useful benchmark of our methodology as the theory is equivalent to three non-interacting massive Majorana fermions. We close in Section VI with conclusions and a discussion of future directions.

TCSA for SU(2)k WZW models

In this section we describe the application of the TCSA [\cite=YZ] to deformations of the SU(2)k Wess-Zumino-Witten model [\cite=KZ] [\cite=Af2]. We thus start by considering Hamiltonians of the form

[formula]

Here Φ is a spin singlet combination of (highest weight or current) fields of the WZW model. The Hamiltonian is defined on a circle of length R. Adding the time coordinate the underlying space-time is an infinite cylinder with circumference R.

The first step in the TCSA is to characterize the unperturbed theory, HSU(2)k. This theory provides the computational basis of the TCSA numerics. HSU(2)k has central charge [formula], and can be written à la Sugawara in terms of the SU(2)k currents:

[formula]

The left-moving currents J0,  ±m obey the algebra,

[formula]

with the right moving currents 0,  ±m obeying the same algebra.

The field content of HSU(2)k consists of k + 1 primary fields, [formula], forming spin [formula] representations. The conformal weight of the spin s primary field is given by Δs  =  s(s + 1) / (k + 2). The primary fields and the WZW currents are the basic tools to construct the Hilbert space of the unperturbed theory, providing the first ingredient of the TCSA. The Hilbert space can be written as a tensor product of its holomorphic (left) and anti-holomorphic (right) degrees of freedom. For SU(2)k, the left and right sectors of the Hilbert space each have k + 1 modules, where each module is associated to one primary field. The module consists of a highest weight state, [formula], together with an infinite tower of descendant states:

[formula]

These states ([\ref=ostates]) are eigenstates of the Virasoro operator L0,

and the third component component of the current J00:

[formula]

The quantity [formula] is called the Kac-Moody level, or simply the level, of the descendant state.

The set of states ([\ref=ostates]) is not yet a basis of the Hilbert space since it is over complete and contains null states. In order to form a complete orthonormal basis, we tackle each Kac-Moody module separately.

We do so in an iterative fashion. At each step we have a set of non-zero norm states which are linearly independent (at the beginning this set will consist solely of the highest weight state). We next add a new descendant state to this set, compute the matrix of scalar products of states in the expanded set (the Gramm matrix), and find its determinant. If it is non-zero, the new state is added to the list; otherwise it is discarded. We then move to the next descendant in the tower of states in increasing order in the level. The process ends when all the states up to a given level have been considered.

This procedure yields a complete set of states that we can easily orthonormalize to obtain a basis. In order to optimize this procedure we take into account the following properties:

states with different L0 quantum number are independent;

states having different spin (eigenvalue of J00) are independent;

we discard the states with null norm;

we act only with level 0 currents, J0,  ±0, directly on the highest weight state |s,s〉 in the module.

To demonstrate that the above method amounts to a numerically intensive task, we present in Table I the number of states per level for the two modules of SU(2)1 and the three modules of SU(2)2.

Once the chiral sector of SU(2)k has been obtained, the total Hilbert space is constructed as a tensor product of the isomorphic holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors. These tensor products are diagonal in the modules, i.e. left moving spin s states are only tensored with their right moving spin s counterparts. In forming these tensor products, we group the states by their value of Lorentz spin, (L0  -  0), and z-component of SU(2) spin, J00  +  00. Recall that the Lorentz spin is proportional to the momentum carried by the corresponding state. In Table [\ref=nonchiral] we present the number of cumulative states up to a given level in SU(2)1 and SU(2)2 with vanishing Lorentz spin.

Once the computational basis has been constructed, the TCSA requires the evaluation of matrix elements of the perturbing operator in that basis. For this purpose one uses the commutation relations of the fields, φs,m(0), with the current modes, J0,  ±0, which are given by

[formula]

With these commutation relations and those of the current modes ([\ref=current-algebra]), matrix elements of the form

[formula]

can be reduced to the structure constants, Cs1,m1,;s2,m2;s3,m3:

[formula]

We list all non-zero structure constants, Cs1,m1,;s2,m2;s3,m3 in Table III for SU(2)1 and SU(2)2.

With the spectrum of the unperturbed SU(2)k model specified and the matrix elements of the perturbing field given, we are able to compute explicitly the matrix elements of the full Hamiltonian on the circle and represent it in matrix form. To be able to analyze this Hamiltonian, we truncate (the truncation in the acronym TCSA) the Hilbert space by discarding all states with a chiral component whose level is greater than Ntr. The resulting finite dimensional Hamiltonian matrix can then be diagonalized numerically, obtaining the spectrum of the perturbed theory. This procedure is particularly robust for relevant perturbations since the low energy eigenstates of the perturbed theory, |r〉, are localized on the low energy conformal states, {|c〉α} . Namely, expanding |r〉 into the conformal basis, {|c〉α},

[formula]

the coefficients bα, are primarily concentrated on the low energy conformal states |c〉α determined by HSU(2)k.

To extract physical quantities for the perturbed Hamiltonian ([\ref=ham]), such as the mass gap, energy levels, correlation functions, etc., the choice of the system size, R, requires special consideration. For mR  ≪  1 (here m is the putative mass scale of the perturbed theory), the system lies in the UV limit where the conformal term, HSU(2)k, of the full Hamiltonian dominates. In this regime the spectrum resembles that of the conformal HSU(2)k where the energy levels scales as 1 / R. In the IR regime, Rm  ≫  1, the perturbation, [formula], dominates and one expects a scaling of the form ~  R1 - 2Δs, where 2Δs is the scaling dimension of the perturbing field. In general, the spectrum of the perturbed model must be extracted in a region of R where the conformal term and the perturbation are balanced in the sense that physical quantities remains stable under small variations of R. This region is usually denoted as the "physical window".

For theories where the dimension of the Hilbert space grows very fast, i.e. SU(2)k with k large, the truncation scheme proposed above may not yield accurate results.

In those cases one can take recourse to a numerical renormalization group (NRG) improvement of the TCSA [\cite=NRG] [\cite=NRG1] [\cite=NRG2] [\cite=NRG3] [\cite=NRG4]. This procedure allows the TCSA to reach much higher truncation levels than that possible in its unadorned form. Taken together with an analytic renormalization group, it is possible to remove the effects of truncation altogether [\cite=NRG]. While this NRG has been tested extensively on relevant perturbations of conformal field theories, it has not hitherto been tried on marginal perturbations of CFTs. We will show in Section IV that the NRG can accurately predict the low lying spectrum even in the marginal case.

SU(2)1 perturbed by the spin-1/2 field

Our first test of the TCSA is the perturbation of the SU(2)1 WZW model by the singlet formed from the spin-1/2 operator of SU(2)1, [formula]:

[formula]

The scaling dimension of Φ is 2Δ1 / 2  =  1 / 2, and so this is a relevant perturbation. Moreover the theory is invariant under h  →   - h. This Hamiltonian is equivalent to the sine-Gordon model whose Lagrangian is given by [\cite=tsvbook]

[formula]

with β2  =  2π. The correspondence between ([\ref=hamrel]) and ([\ref=SG]) is based on the identifications

[formula]

which, up to phase redefinitions, are the bosonization formulas of the SU(2)1 model [\cite=dif].

We now demonstrate that the TCSA numerics reproduce the expected behavior of the sine-Gordon model at this value of the SG coupling. The spectrum of the sine-Gordon model at β2  =  2π is composed of a soliton S and antisoliton S̄ with mass M and two breathers B1 and B2 with masses M1 = M and [formula] respectively. The soliton, anti-soliton, and the first breather form a triplet under SU(2). The charges of the particles (S,B1,S̄) are given by (1,0,-1) and they coincide with their Sz quantum number. The second breather, B2, is a singlet under SU(2).

Fig. [\ref=SGspectrum] shows the low energy TCSA spectrum which reproduces the basic structure: a low lying triplet with mass M, and a single excitation at roughly [formula]. The expected value of the mass M can be determined from the coupling constant used in the TCSA. The relation between the coupling of the sine-Gordon model and the mass M is given as [\cite=SGmass]

[formula]

where [formula]. With h = 0.0942753.. we expect the mass to be 1 while from the TCSA we find M = 1.0016, in excellent agreement.

For the second breather, found roughly at [formula], a more careful analysis of the TCSA data is required. For this excitation there are significant finite size corrections. These corrections can be understood as virtual processes on the cylinder [\cite=KlaMe] [\cite=YZ], which are suppressed exponentially as R becomes large. For B2 these corrections are given by [\cite=KlaMe]

[formula]

We can estimate the so-called error exponent to be σB2 = 1.105 [\cite=KlaMe]. Here SB2B2B2B2(θ) is the scattering S-matrix of the process B2 + B2  →  B2 + B2 [\cite=2Zam]. Fitting mB2  +  ΔmB2(R) to the TCSA data, we find that MB2 / M = 1.7322  ±  0.0003. Using this mass, we plot mB2  +  ΔmB2 against the TCSA data in Fig. [\ref=SingleB2], which shows an excellent agreement between the theory and the TCSA data for R > 9.

We now turn to the ground state energy Egs. The TCSA gives Egs as would be computed in conformal perturbation theory to all orders. This perturbative energy can be expressed as the sum of a linear term in R, proportional to a bulk energy density, εbulk, plus a term given by the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz ETBA [\cite=Zam3StatePotts] [\cite=YZ].

[formula]

The bulk contribution to Egs is given by [\cite=SGfreeEn]

[formula]

For sine-Gordon with β2 = 2π, α  =  0.14438.... The contribution from ETBA(R) is given by the solution of a coupled set of integral equations involving the S-matrices of the various excitations in the model [\cite=Zam3StatePotts] [\cite=YZ]. At large R, this contribution reads

[formula]

and essentially marks the correction to the energy due to the spontaneous emission of a virtual particle from the vacuum which travels around the system before being reabsorbed. Fig. [\ref=TBAgs] shows the TCSA data against the theoretical values of Egs (including the full, not just the leading order large R, contribution coming from ETBA(R)). There is a good agreement for R smaller than mR = 8 and then slight deviations thereafter, which can be reduced by increasing the value of Ntr (see Fig. [\ref=TBAgs]).

Above the single particle states, one encounters sets of two-particle states consisting of pairs of particles from the triplet and the singlet of the SG model. These two-particle states can be organized into SU(2) multiplets. For example, two-particle states involving the triplet decompose as [formula]. These states suffer finite size corrections due to scattering between the particles. These effects can be taken into account by solving the quantization conditions for the momentum in finite volume:

[formula]

where θi    (i = 1,2) are the rapidities of the particles that parametrize their energy-momentum, [formula], and Sij is the scattering matrix between the two particles [\cite=Z2]. The solution of these equations, for a pair (n1,n2), yields the rapidities as a function of R, and so the energy of these states. Fig. [\ref=BA] shows reasonably good agreement between the analytical and the TCSA results, particularly at large values of R. At smaller R, single particle virtual processes become important, leading to deviations between the TCSA and our analytic estimates.

SU(2)1 perturbed by current-current interactions

In this section we consider the perturbation of the SU(2)1 WZW model by the marginal current-current operator,

[formula]

Unlike the perturbation by the spin-1/2 field, here the sign of g matters as it differentiates the model's behavior in the IR limit [\cite=2Zam]. For g  >  0 the perturbation is marginally relevant and asymptotically free. The corresponding theory is a massive integrable rational field theory (RFT) coinciding with the SU(2) Thirring model [\cite=Thir]. And for g  <  0 the coupling is marginally irrelevant and the theory undergoes a massless RG flow towards the SU(2)1 fixed point.

We address two questions here. We first ask if we can determine with the TCSA the universal correction (as explained below) to the ground state energy due to the marginal perturbation. And second, we question if the numerical renormalization group improvement of the TCSA works in the context of marginal perturbations [\cite=NRG] [\cite=NRG1] [\cite=NRG2] [\cite=NRG3] [\cite=NRG4].

Universal Term in Ground State Energy from the TCSA

In the small g regime, the correction to the ground state energy on the cylinder is given in perturbation theory by [\cite=Cardy]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

We write these expressions so that they are valid for a general dimension, x, of the perturbing operator, φ( = L  ·  R for x = 2). Our conventions are such that two point function of φ is (on the plane)

[formula]

while its corresponding three point function equals

[formula]

with b = 3 / 2. The β  -  function for this theory in these conventions is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is then the dimensionless coupling and l is a logarithmic length scale. To convert to the conventions of Refs. [\cite=Cardy] [\cite=LudwigCardy], we need to take [formula].

Although the theory is defined on a spacetime cylinder, under a conformal transformation the integrals can be written as integrals over the plane, as given above. The integrals I2 and I3 are UV divergent and require regulation. The divergent pieces of these integrals contribute to the non-universal piece of E0 (non-universal because their value depends on the regulation scheme). If εp is a short distance regulator in the plane (i.e. the difference of two plane integration variables is not permitted to be smaller than εp), both I2 and I3 contain terms proportional to ε- 2p (for x = 2). Under a conformal transformation, εp is related to a short distance regulator on the cylinder, εc, by εp = 2πεc / R. Thus the divergent pieces lead non-universal correction of the form

[formula]

i.e. these corrections scale linearly with the system size.

On the other hand, the universal corrections coming from I2 and I3 are independent of the details of the regulator. Such corrections are usually accessed through analytic continuation in the operator dimension x. For sufficiently small x, the resulting perturbative integrals become convergent. For such a range of x, one then introduces a regulator, εp, and expands in a Taylor series, finding that I2 and I3 have the form [\cite=Cardy] [\cite=LudwigCardy]:

[formula]

Because everything is convergent, expressions can be developed for I2,univ.(x) and I3,univ.(x) as a function of x. The universal terms' values close to x = 2 are then the analytically continued parts of the expansion of I2 and I3 that are independent of the UV regulator (the non-universal terms, in contrast, in general either diverge or vanish close to x = 2). The relationship between I3,subleading(x) and I2,univ(x) arises from the OPE, φφ  ~  bφ[\cite=LudwigCardy].

In the case at hand, the universal contributions near x = 2 are [\cite=Cardy] [\cite=LudwigCardy]

[formula]

We also include the evaluation of I3,subleading(x) because exactly at x = 2 the prefactor of this term becomes independent of εp. Its evaluation, with important consequences, will turn out to depend upon the choice of regulator.

The universal and subleading parts of I2 and I3 allow us to write the universal part of E0 solely as a function of the running coupling (l), compatible with scaling theory [\cite=LudwigCardy]. E0,univ in terms of the bare dimensionless coupling,   =  gε2 - xc, is equal to

[formula]

Supposing [formula], we can use the β  -  function to express [formula] in terms of (l):

[formula]

where [formula] is the zero of the β  -  function. We then have

[formula]

c((l)) is nothing more than Zamolodchikov's c-function [\cite=ZamC]. We see that ∂(l)c((l)) has the same zero, *, as the β  -  function, as it should. We also see that exactly at the marginal point, x = 2, there is a finite third order correction in (l) to the ground state energy.

An interesting question is what of this universal behavior can be extracted from the TCSA. While it has been suggested in Ref. [\cite=KlaMe2] that the dependency of the TCSA data upon the UV regulator (here, the truncation level, Ntr) obscures such terms, it has been shown in Ref. [\cite=Watts2] that upon the subtraction of leading and sub-leading order divergences, universal IR behavior can be observed. In answering these questions, the breaking of Lorentz invariance by the TCSA regulator will turn out to be key.

In order to determine the nature of the universal behaviour in the TCSA approach, we need to compute the integrals I2 and I3 with the TCSA regulator in place. This however can be straightforwardly done [\cite=Watts2]. The essential idea is that these integrals can be expanded in powers of the integration variables z1,2. These expansions can then be compared with a Lehmann expansion of the corresponding correlation function (see Appendix A.1). By truncating the Lehmann expansion to the same low energy states used in the TCSA, we are able to compute I2,3 with the TCSA regulator. The results precisely at the marginal point x = 2 (see Appendices A.2 and A.3 for details) are surprisingly simple and can be computed exactly:

[formula]

These expressions for I2,3 contain both non-universal terms (as is evident from the dependency on Ntr) and potential universal terms. The question becomes how to identify which is which. We do so by comparison with the evaluation of I2 and I3 in Refs. [\cite=Cardy] [\cite=LudwigCardy] already given in Eqn.([\ref=I2I3]). At x = 2, I2(x = 0) is purely non-universal, i.e. I2,univ.(x = 2) = 0. This corresponds to our finding that I2 is proportional to Ntr(Ntr + 1) and indicates that the regulator, εp, used in Ref. [\cite=Cardy] [\cite=LudwigCardy] can be identified with the TCSA regulator via [formula]. However ITCSA3 is also proportional to Ntr(Ntr + 1), which seems to imply that the third order contribution to Egs, as with second order, is purely non-universal. We see then already at x = 2 that the TCSA regulator leads to a different universal structure to E0,univ than the Lorentz invariant regulator employed in [\cite=Cardy] [\cite=LudwigCardy].

We verify the accuracy of this perturbative computation by comparing it with the TCSA numerics. In Fig.[\ref=marginal] we plot E0 at small g evaluated numerically against the perturbative results. We obtain excellent agreement. To analyze more closely the possible presence of a universal term in the numerics, we plot in Fig. [\ref=marginal1] the residual ground state energy arrived at by subtracting from the numerical data the perturbative contributions (solely non-universal) corresponding to ITCSA2 + ITCSA3. To determine whether the numerics indicate any universal contribution, we plot the residual as a function of g and fit the results to a function of the form g3(a + gbNtr(Ntr + 1)). These fits put an approximate bound (the value of a) on the third order universal term consistent with the numerics. We find it to be considerably smaller than that found in Ref. [\cite=Cardy] [\cite=LudwigCardy], consistent with our previous statement that in the regulation scheme used by the TCSA, there is no universal term at third order in the coupling.

To get at the origin of the discrepancy between the TCSA evaluation of E0,univ and that of Refs. [\cite=Cardy] [\cite=LudwigCardy], we evaluate the integrals, I2 and I3 in the TCSA regulation scheme away from the marginal point. These integrals have the structure (compare with Eqn. [\ref=I2I3x])

[formula]

We can evaluate the divergent and universal parts exactly (see Appendices A.4 and A.5)

[formula]

where B(x,y) is the β  -  function and 3F2 is a generalized hypergeometric function. The subleading terms we are only able to evaluate numerically. Close to x = 2 we find

[formula]

Plots of their values near x = 2 can be found in Appendices A.4 and A.5.

Now how does this compare to the results of [\cite=Cardy] [\cite=LudwigCardy]? Remarkably the universal (constant) parts of I2 and I3 are the same (compare Eqn. ([\ref=I2I3x])):

[formula]

In particular

[formula]

We however see discrepancies in the subleading term, I3,subleading:

[formula]

This difference is a consequence of the TCSA's different (non-Lorentz invariant) regulator. It is possible to understand this difference as I3,subleading is finite at x = 2 due to a cancellation in a pole term due to an OPE and a zero in I2,univ.. This delicate cancellation leaves I3,subleading sensitive to choice of regulator in a way that I3,univ. is not.

What are then the implications of I3,subleading(x) depending upon the regulator? Firstly we obtain an altered Zamolodchikov c-function:

[formula]

where εTCSA  =  N- 1tr. Interestingly the TCSA c-function agrees with that derived previously in Ref. [\cite=LudwigCardy] for x < 2 in the large Ntr (small εp) limit. However it is not solely a function of (l) as would be suggested by scaling theory.

As we have already noted, at x = 2 the 3(l) term vanishes in cTCSA(). This suggests that corrections that contribute to the universal part of the ground state energy are sensitive to the use of a non-Lorentz invariant regulator. It is interesting to note that these Lorentz invariant corrections are seen in models which are the lattice equivalent of these field theories and so do not have Lorentz invariance. Ref. [\cite=Kluemper], using a quantum transfer matrix approach, has analyzed the XXX Heisenberg model, a lattice equivalent of SU(2)1 with a marginally irrelevant current-current interaction. In this work it is shown that the g3 term as computed in Refs. [\cite=LudwigCardy] [\cite=Lukyanov] using a Lorentz-invariant regulator is seen in the low temperature specific heat of the spin chain. At least for the XXX spin chain, terms in its field theoretic equivalent Hamiltonian that break Lorentz invariance are irrelevant rather than marginal in nature [\cite=Lukyanov].

An interesting possibility [\cite=CardyPC] is that the universal structure of the ground state energy as determined in a Lorentz invariant field theory remains in the presence of a non-Lorentz invariant regulator provided one allows the "speed of light" in the system to be renormalized by the interactions (a possibility if Lorentz invariance is broken), that is to say that all of the consequences of breaking Lorentz invariance reside in a renormalization of c. Because the ground state energy depends upon 1 / c (throughout this paper we have set the bare value of c to 1), we cannot distinguish between a breaking of universality in the ground state energy and a renormalization of c.

NRG and Marginal Perturbations

In this subsection we apply the numerical renormalization group to the study of the marginal current-current perturbation of SU(2)1. The NRG is a technique that allows the TCSA to include states at much higher conformal levels than would be possible with a straight exact diagonalization. It does so by taking a cue from Kenneth Wilson's NRG [\cite=wilson]: it takes into account the states that have a weaker influence on the low energy eigenstates of the full theory, in this case high energy conformal states, only in numerically manageable chunks. It works in the case of a relevant perturbation because such perturbations guarantee that the high energy conformal Hilbert space only affects weakly the low energy sector of the theory. Thus it is not clear, a priori, whether the NRG will work in the case of a marginal perturbation where the high and low energy sectors of the theory are more tightly coupled. We will, however, see that the NRG does work, reproducing with high accuracy the results of the TCSA run with a straight exact diagonalization.

Fig. [\ref=nrg+marginal] shows the RG evolution of the energies of the ground state, the first excited state, and the fifth excited state. The NRG results converge towards the exact diagonalization results with excellent accuracy. At least for the low lying energies in marginally perturbed conformal field theories, the NRG seems to be able to reproduce the expected energies, despite their dependencies upon the TCSA UV cutoff, Ntr.

SU(2)2 perturbed by the spin-1 field

In this section we apply the TCSA to a deformation of the SU(2)2 WZW model [\cite=dif]. The SU(2)2 WZW model is a [formula] conformal field theory with three primary fields, the spin-0 identity field, a spin [formula] field, φ1 / 2,  ±  1 / 2, and a spin 1 field, φ1,{  ±  1,0}, with conformal weights Δ = 0, [formula], and [formula] respectively.

SU(2)2 WZW can be thought of as a theory of three non-interacting massless Majorana fermions (the spin-1 fields). Perturbing SU(2)2 with the spin-1 field,

[formula]

makes the fermions massive. Finding such a spectrum however is a strong check on the TCSA as the massive Majorana fermions are not simply expressible in the conformal current algebra basis.

Fig. [\ref=su2spectrum] shows the low lying excited states from the TCSA. The coupling g is fixed to a value where the mass of the first excited state is 1. The TCSA captures this state (the Sz = 0 state of the triplet of massive Majoranas) as well as a set of three two particle states with an energy approximately equal to 2. The Majorana fermions are non-interacting, hence their mass must scale linearly with g. This behavior is shown in Fig. [\ref=su2_2]a. We also consider the finite size corrections to one of the two-particle states. Even though non-interacting, the quantization condition for the two-particle state, Eqn. [\ref=quant], is non-trivial as one needs to quantize with a doublet of distinct integers (n1,n2), n1  ≠  n2. Fig. [\ref=su2_2]b shows that the TCSA energy of the two-particle state matches the prediction derived from Eqn. [\ref=quant].

Conclusions and Discussions

In this paper we have applied the TCSA to perturbations of SU(2)k. The general methodology is illustrated with various examples. We began by studying the SU(2)1 + Tr(g) perturbation, equivalent to the sine-Gordon model at a particular value of its coupling. We showed the TCSA accurately captured both the ground state energy and excited state spectrum including finite size corrections. We next turned to SU(2)1 + L  ·  R, a WZW model perturbed by a marginal interaction. We demonstrated that one can accurately identify analytically the leading UV divergences in perturbation theory that characterize the ground state energy as computed numerically by the TCSA. By subtracting these UV divergences (i.e. the non-universal contributions to the ground state energy) we isolated the universal contribution to the ground state energy due to the marginal perturbation. We find that it differs from that predicted with calculations using Lorentz invariant regulators. Interestingly, away from the marginal point, the universal structure of the ground state energy is restored. Finally we considered SU(2)2 perturbed by Tr(g)2. This model is equivalent to three massive non-interacting Majorana fermions. The TCSA, is able to reproduce the expected spectrum. This is a non-trivial check of our methodology as the Majorana fermions do not have a simple representation in the current algebra basis employed by the approach.

We have developed this capability to study perturbed WZW models in order to tackle a number of problems. In particular, we have two in mind. In the first, we plan to examine the dimerized-frustrated J1 - J2  -  δ Heisenberg model whose Hamiltonian is

[formula]

Field theory analyses [\cite=Af1] argue that the low energy sector of this theory is equivalent to

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. If the marginal perturbation g is absent, the model's spin gap, ΔS, would scale simply with h: [formula]. In the presence of g, however, this scaling is altered to become [formula]. However this altered scaling has been difficult to see in DMRG studies of the dimerized-frustrated Heisenberg model [\cite=branes] [\cite=kumar]. It would be extremely interesting to analyze this scaling behavior using the TCSA.

Our study here of SU(2)1 + L  ·  R has thus lain the groundwork for this future study.

The second problem that we intend to tackle is the study of possible integrable perturbations of SU(2)k for k > 1. There are indications, coming from Zamolodchikov-type counting arguments [\cite=Zamcounting], that those perturbations do exists. We intend to study these perturbations with the TCSA, extracting both the spectrum of the model as well as evidence for or against their integrability. The example analyzed in this paper concerning SU(2)2 shows that this goal is within reach.

Evaluation of the Perturbative Integrals from the Current-Current Perturbation of SU(2)1

TCSA regularization and the Lehmann representation

We implement the UV regularization explicit in the TCSA with a truncation of the Lehmann representation of the n-point functions [\cite=Watts1] [\cite=Watts2]. As an explicit example, we compute the two point function using this truncation. Introducing projectors PNtr and PNtr that project out all chiral states of level higher than Ntr, we can write the two point function appearing in the evaluation of the second order perturbative contribution to the ground state energy as

[formula]

where T is the usual time ordering operator. These projectors act to truncate the Lehmann mode expansion arising from the insertion of the resolution of the identity in between the fields of ([\ref=p]):

[formula]

Here the truncated sum is over all states whose conformal level is less than Ntr and we just considered the contribution with t < 0. Using the time and space translation operator, e- Ht - iPx, and defining [formula] and [formula], we can rewrite the above as

[formula]

so reducing the correlation function to a sum over powers in z and [formula]. We see in this sum that no power greater than Ntr of z or [formula] appears.

The case of the third order correction to the energy involving a three-point function follows the same strategy. We insert the projectors

[formula]

arriving, in the case where t' < 0 < t, at

[formula]

If we again use the space time translation operator and use the notation [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula], we obtain

[formula]

that is a truncated polynomial at order Ntr in z,,w,.

Evaluation of I2 at x = 2

We want to compute the integral, ITCSA2, by regularizing as we did with ([\ref=p]). Transforming the integral in I2 back to the cylinder we obtain,

[formula]

where the factor of two counts the two contributions coming from time ordering. If we then expand the integrand as a power series in z, and compare with Eqn. [\ref=leh2], we see we should truncate the sum as follows

[formula]

whereupon the integral and sum are easily computed:

[formula]

Comparing with the evaluation in [\cite=Cardy] [\cite=LudwigCardy], we see that we obtain a relationship between the TCSA regulator and the short distance cutoff, εp, used in [\cite=Cardy] [\cite=LudwigCardy]:

[formula]

Evaluation of I3 at x = 2

We now turn to computing ITCSA3:

[formula]

Moving to the cylinder, the time ordering gives 6 contributions, t < t' < 0, t > t' > 0, t < 0 < t' and those with t  ↔  t', all being equal. We show, as an example, the integral for t > 0 > t':

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. We compute the contribution this makes by expanding the above in a power series of z,,w, and truncating it at the Ntr-th power, matching the truncation in the Lehmann expansion in Eqn. [\ref=leh3]. The integrand in ([\ref=3rd]) then becomes

[formula]

where C is defined by

[formula]

and all the indexes are positive or zero. The integrals can now be done and the sum that so arises evaluated to be

[formula]

Once combined with the other five equal contributions, we obtain the final result:

[formula]

Evaluation of ITCSA2(x)

For general x, I2 once transformed back onto the cylinder reads

[formula]

Expanding the integrands in powers of z and [formula], truncating with level Ntr, and performing the integrals leaves us with (compare Eqn. ([\ref=I2]))

[formula]

The coefficient of the first term in the above can be determined from the Euler-Maclaurin formula converting a sum to an integral in combination with our exact result at x = 2. The result is

[formula]

The universal term, ITCSA2,univ., can be determined from performing the integral in Eqn. ([\ref=I2x]) for 0  <  x  <  1 and then analytically continuing [\cite=Cardy]:

[formula]

Finally we determine ITCSA2,subleading(x) numerically: we compute the sum in Eqn. ([\ref=I2xsum]) numerically as a function of Ntr, subtract the first two terms in the second line of Eqn. ([\ref=I2xsum]), and fit the remainder to extract the coefficient of N2x - 6tr. The results are plotted in Fig. ([\ref=I2subleading]). We note in particular that as x  →  2, ITCSA2,subleading(x)  →  0.

Evaluation of ITCSA3(x)

ITCSA3(x) is computed by first reexpressing I3(x) as an integral over the cylinder:

[formula]

where zi = e2π(ixi + ti) / R. Expanding the integrand in powers of zi and truncating these sums on the basis of a comparison with the Lehmann expansion leaves us with

[formula]

ITCSA3(x) then has a similar structure to ITCSA2(x):

[formula]

We infer that the leading term of ITCSA3(x) must be proportional to (Ntr(Ntr + x - 1))x - 1 - otherwise the relationship between the TCSA cutoff, Ntr, and εp established in the evaluation of I2 would breakdown. (We will in any case verify this numerically in what is to come.) The coefficient of the leading term can be found be converting the sums to integrals:

[formula]

We can also evaluate analytically ITCSA3,univ.(x). This can be computed by performing the integral in Eqn. ([\ref=integrals]) for values of x where it is convergent and then analytically continuing. To make this evaluation we first perform the integration by parts suggested in Ref. [\cite=LudwigCardy]:

[formula]

We now evaluate this integral following the techniques introduced in Ref. [\cite=Dotsenko] and used in Ref. [\cite=sg_pt]. Writing zi  =  xi  +  iyi and making the changes of variables:

[formula]

followed by

[formula]

allows us to rewrite I3(x) as

[formula]

where Δw / y = (w / y)+ - (w / y)-. The positions of the contours for w- and y- relative to the various branch cuts of the arguments depend on the values of w+ and y+. Only for certain values of w+ and y+ is it not possible to deform the contours w- / y- to infinity without encountering poles or branch cuts. This allows us to restrict the limits of w+ and y+ dramatically, simplifying the above integral to

[formula]

The contours Ci,i = 1,2,3,4 are defined in Fig. ([\ref=contours]). These four separate integrals can now readily be expressed in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions with the results found in Eqn. ([\ref=evalI3]).

Finally we can evaluate ITCSA3,subleading(x) numerically. We compute this coefficient by evaluating the sum in Eqn. ([\ref=I3sum]) for a range of Ntr, subtracting off ITCSA3,div. and ITCSA3,univ.. The remainder is proportional to Nx - 2tr and we extract ITCSA3,subleading as the fitting coefficient. The results are found in Fig. [\ref=I3subleading]. We see in particular that ITCSA3,subleading(x)  →  2π2 as x  →  2.
