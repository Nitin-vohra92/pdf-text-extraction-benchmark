Key words: Comodule Hom-coalgebra, comodule coalgebra. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 16W30, 16S30.

Abstract. We introduce the concept of comodule Hom-coalgebras and show that comodule Hom-coalgebras can be deformed from comodule coalgebras via endomorphisms.

Introduction and Main Results

Hom-type algebras first appeared in the form of Hom-Lie algebras, which satisfy a twisted version of the Jacobi identiy. Hom-algebras have been introduced for the first time in [\cite=ms] to construct Hom-Lie algebras using the commutator bracket. The universal Hom-associative algebra of a Hom-Lie algebra was studied in [\cite=yau1]. Module Hom-algebras and Comodule Hom-algebras have been studied by D. Yau in [\cite=yau31] [\cite=yau32] [\cite=yau33]. Some other Hom-type algebras such as n-ary Hom-Nambu algebras and n-ary Hom-Nambu-Lie algebras have been studied in [\cite=amm] [\cite=yau4].

In this article, we introduce the concept of comodule Hom-coalgebras, the dual vision of module Hom-algebras, study some of their properties. We also show that comodule Hom-coalgebras can be deformed from comodule coalgebras via endomorphisms. All of our results are dual to D. Yau's work in [\cite=yau31] [\cite=yau33]. The difference between our's and his is that, since we are dealing with comodules and coalgebras, we will find that the Sweedler notions [\cite=sweedler] [\cite=dnr] are more convenient for us to do the work.

Roughly speaking, an H-comodule Hom-coalgebra structure on C consists of the following data:

1. (H,μH,ΔH,αH) is a Hom-bialgebra;

2. (C,ΔC,αC) is a Hom-coassociative coalgebra;

3. C has an H-comodule structure [formula], such that

[formula]

We call [\eqref=eq:mha''] the comodule Hom-coalgebra axiom. Here [formula] is the map [formula] for [formula], [formula].

Using Sweedler's notions, [\eqref=eq:mha''] can be written as

[formula]

for c∈C. If α2H  =  idH (e.g., if αH  =  idH), then [\eqref=eq:mha'''] reduces to the usual comodule coalgebra axiom

[formula]

In particular, comodule coalgebras are examples of comodule Hom-coalgebras in which αH = idH,αC  =  idC.

On the other direction, we can construct comodule Hom-coalgebras from comodule coalgebras, as our main results Theorem [\ref=thm:char] and Theorem [\ref=thm:deform] show. The first Theorem gives an alternative characterization of comodule Hom-coalgebras and the second one shows that we can deform comodule coalgebras into comodule Hom-coalgebras via endomorphisms.

Let H  =  (H,μH,ΔH,αH) be a Hom-bialgebra, C  =  (C,ΔC,αC) be a Hom-coassociative coalgebra, and [formula] be an H-comodule structure on C. Then the following statements hold.

The map

[formula]

gives C another H-comodule structure.

The map

[formula]

gives [formula] an H-comodule structure.

The map δ gives C the structure of an H-comodule Hom-coalgebra if and only if [formula] is a morphism of H-comodules, where we equip [formula] and C with the H-comodule structures [\eqref=eq:rho2] and [\eqref=eq:rhotilde], respectively.

Let H  =  (H,μH,ΔH) be a bialgebra and C  =  (C,ΔC) be an H-comodule coalgebra via [formula]. Let αH:H  →  H be a bialgebra endomorphism and αC:C  →  C be an coalgebra endomorphism such that

[formula]

Write Hα for the Hom-bialgebra [formula] and Cα for the Hom-coassociative coalgebra [formula]. Then the map

[formula]

gives the Hom-coassociative coalgebra Cα the structure of an Hα-comodule Hom-coalgebra.

Consider now a special case of Theorem [\ref=thm:deform] when αH  =  idH, we have the following corollary.

Let H  =  (H,μH,ΔH) be a bialgebra, C  =  (C,ΔC) be an H-comodule coalgebra via [formula], and αC:C  →  C be an coalgebra endomorphism that is also H-linear. Then the map δα [\eqref=eq:rhoalpha] gives the Hom-coassociative coalgebra Cα the structure of an H-comodule Hom-coalgebra, where H denotes the Hom-bialgebra (H,μH,ΔH,idH).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:intro], we give an introduction of our work and the statement of our main results. In Section [\ref=sec:modalg], we revisit the relevant definitions and prove the first two parts of Theorem [\ref=thm:char]. In Section [\ref=sec:deform], we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:deform] and the third part of Theorem [\ref=thm:char].

Preliminaries and Some Lemmas

In this section, we first recall some basic definitions regarding Hom-modules, Hom-associative algebras, Hom-coassociative coalgebras, and Hom-bialgebras. The first two parts of Theorem [\ref=thm:char] will be proved as Lemmas [\ref=lem:rhotilde] and [\ref=lem:rho2]. The last part will be proved in the next section.

Throughout the rest of this paper, vector spaces and linear maps are over a field [formula] of any characteristic. Given two vector spaces U and V, denote by [formula] the twist map, i.e., [formula]. For a coalgebra C with comultiplication [formula], we use Sweedler's notation for comultiplication: [formula]. For a comodule [formula] over a coalgebra C, we will write [formula] [\cite=dnr].

A Hom-module is a pair (V,α) [\cite=yau1] in which V is a vector space and α:V  →  V is a linear map. A morphism (V,αV)  →  (W,αW) of Hom-modules is a linear map f:V  →  W such that [formula]. We will often abbreviate a Hom-module (V,α) to V. The tensor product of the Hom-modules (V,αV) and (W,αW) consists of the vector space [formula] and the linear self-map [formula].

A Hom-associative algebra [\cite=ms] [\cite=ms3] [\cite=yau2] is a triple (A,μ,α) in which (A,α) is a Hom-module and [formula] is a bilinear map such that

[formula] (multiplicativity) and

[formula] (Hom-associativity).

If we write [formula], this means that for any a,b,c∈A,

[formula]

[formula]

A morphism f:(A,μA,αA)  →  (B,μB,αB) of two Hom-associative algebras is a morphism f:(A,αA)  →  (B,αB) of the underlying Hom-modules such that f(ab) = f(a)f(b) for all a,b∈A.

A Hom-coassociative coalgebra [\cite=ms] [\cite=ms3] is a triple (C,Δ,α) in which (C,α) is a Hom-comodule and [formula] is a bilinear map such that

[formula] (comultiplicativity) and

[formula] (Hom-coassociativity).

In what follows, we will also write [formula]. So in Sweedler's notation, the above condition means that

[formula]

[formula]

Suppose that (C,ΔC,αC) and (D,ΔD,αD) are two Hom-coassociative coalgebras. Their tensor product [formula] is a Hom-coassociative coalgebra, with [formula] and

[formula]

A morphism f:(C,ΔC,αC)  →  (D,ΔD,αD) of Hom-coassociative coalgebras is a morphism f:(C,αC)  →  (D,αD) of the underlying Hom-modules such that [formula], i.e. [formula].

A Hom-bialgebra is a quadruple (H,μ,Δ,α) in which:

(H,μ,α) is a Hom-associative algebra.

(H,Δ,α) is a Hom-coassociative coalgebra.

Δ is a morphism of Hom-associative algebras.

Note that Δ being a morphism of Hom-associative algebras means that

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

Let (C,ΔC,αC) be a Hom-coassociative coalgebra and (M,αM) be a Hom-module. An C-comodule structure on M consists of a morphism [formula] of Hom-modules, called the structure map, such that

[formula]

We will write [formula] for m∈M. In this notation, [\eqref=eq:moduleaxiom] can be rewritten as

[formula]

If M and N are C-comodules, then a morphism of C-comodules f:M  →  N is a morphism of the underlying Hom-modules such that

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

Let (H,μH,ΔH,αH) be a Hom-bialgebra and (C,ΔC,αC) be a Hom-coassociative coalgebra. An H-comodule Hom-coalgebra structure on C consists of an H-comodule structure [formula] on C such that

[formula]

We call [\eqref=eq:mha] the comodule Hom-coalgebra axiom. Here [formula] is the map [formula] (see also [\eqref=eq:rho2'] in Lemma [\ref=lem:rho2] with M = N = C).

If we write [formula] for c∈C, then [\eqref=eq:mha] can be written as

[formula]

In [\cite=yau2], D.Yau proved that we can deform an associative algebra into a Hom-associative algebra. Dually, our first lemma [\ref=lem:homcoalg] says that we can deform a coassociative coalgebra into a Hom-coassociative coalgebra.

Let (C,Δ) be a coassociative coalgebra and α:C  →  C be an coalgebra endomorphism of the coalgebra (C,Δ). Define the map

[formula]

Then Cα  =  (C,Δα,α) is a Hom-coassociative coalgebra.

We prove that Δα is Hom-coassociative.

[formula]

For the third equality, we use the fact that (C,Δ) is a coassociative coalgebra. Comultiplicativity of α with respect to Δα can be checked similarly.

The following Lemma will be needed in proving the first part of Theorem [\ref=thm:char].

Let (C,ΔC,αC) be a Hom-coassociative coalgebra and (M,αM) be a C-comodule with structure map [formula]. Define the map

[formula]

i.e. [formula]. Then [formula] is the structure map of another C-comodule structure on M.

The fact that δ is a morphism of Hom-comodules means that

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

First, we show that [formula] is a morphism of Hom-comodules:

[formula]

Second, we show that [formula] satisfies [\eqref=eq:moduleaxiom]:

[formula]

This completes the proof of the Lemma.

The following Lemma proves the second part of Theorem [\ref=thm:char]. By an H-comodule, we mean a comodule over the Hom-coassociative coalgebra (H,μ,α).

Let (H,μH,ΔH,αH) be a Hom-bialgebra, (M,αM) and (N,αN) be an H-comodule with structure map [formula] and [formula] respectively. Define the map

[formula]

[formula]

Then δMN is the structure map of an H-comodule structure on [formula].

First, we show that δMN is a morphism of Hom-comodules:

[formula]

To see that δMN satisfies [\eqref=eq:moduleaxiom] (with δMN, H, and [formula] in place of δ, C, and M, respectively), we compute as follows:

[formula]

This completes the proof of the Lemma.

Proof of the Main Theorems

The first two parts of the Theorem were proved in Lemma [\ref=lem:rhotilde] and Lemma [\ref=lem:rho2]. For the third part, we have equip C and [formula] with the H-comodule structures [formula] [\eqref=eq:rhot] and δCC [\eqref=eq:rho2'], respectively. Then ΔC is a morphism of H-comodules if and only if

[formula]

This is exactly the comodule Hom-coalgebra axiom [\eqref=eq:mha]. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:char].

The Hom-coassociative coalgebra [formula] was discussed in section [\ref=sec:modalg]. The proof that δα is the structure map of an H-comodule structure on C is given in Lemmas [\ref=lem:rhotilde] and [\ref=lem:rho2].

In order to show that [formula] gives Cα the structure of an Hα-comodule Hom-coalgebra, we only need to check that the comodule Hom-coalgebra axiom [\eqref=eq:mha] holds.

In this case, the comodule Hom-coalgebra axiom [\eqref=eq:mha] means that

[formula]

Let us compute the two sides of [\eqref=eq:mhadeform] as follows:

[formula]

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:deform].
