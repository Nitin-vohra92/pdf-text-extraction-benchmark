Koide's Z3-symmetric parametrization, quark masses and mixings

The doubly special Koide's parametrization

The appearance of three generations of leptons and quarks and the related issue of their masses started to baffle us three quarters of a century ago. Over the years the problem has become further complicated by the presence of inter-generation mixing, as revealed in weak interactions. Fortunately, various approximate regularities have been found in the observed pattern of particle masses and mixings. Among the many possible parametrizations of these regularities, there might be some whose simplicity could help us in deciphering physics beyond the Standard Model.

One of the most interesting of such regularities is an empirical relation between the charged-lepton masses discovered by Koide [\cite=Koide] (for a brief review see [\cite=RiveroGsponer]):

[formula]

with kL equal exactly 1. When the experimental e and μ masses (here taken from [\cite=PDG]) are inserted into Eq. ([\ref=KoideFormula]), this relation predicts the tauon mass within one standard deviation from its observed value:

[formula]

Discussions of this success of Koide's formula ([\ref=KoideFormula]) are naturally formulated in a Z3-symmetric framework by parametrizing the masses of any three given fermions f1,f2,f3 in terms of three parameters Mf,kf,δf as [\cite=Koide2] [\cite=Brannen]:

[formula]

This choice of parametrization of masses is particularly suited to Koide's formula as not only Mf but also δf drop out of the r.h.s. of Eq. ([\ref=KoideFormula]).

Since δf is free we may assume m1  ≤  m2  ≤  m3 without any loss of generality. From Eq. ([\ref=KoideParametrization]) one then gets a counterpart of Eq. ([\ref=KoideFormula]), in which it is now kL that drops out of the formula:

[formula]

From the experimental values of e, μ and τ masses one finds:

[formula]

which, as observed by Brannen and Rosen [\cite=Brannen2] [\cite=Rosen], is extremely close to

[formula]

Conversely, assuming δL = 2 / 9, Eq. ([\ref=tandeltaL]) predicts the value of the tauon mass in terms of experimental e and μ masses. Just as in the case of Koide's formula, the relevant prediction is within one standard deviation from the measured τ mass:

[formula]

Assuming that the Koide and the Brannen-Rosen observations do not reflect mere coincidences, the Z3-symmetric parametrization ([\ref=KoideParametrization]) should be rightly called 'doubly special'. A peculiar feature of this parametrization is that the simple numbers of 1 and 2 / 9 work well at the low-energy scale and not at some high mass scale. For example, taking the values of charged-lepton masses at the mass scale of MZ, the extracted values of kL and δL deviate from their 'perfect' values of 1 and 2 / 9 by about 0.2 % and 0.5 % respectively. Apparently, an explanation of the success of predictions ([\ref=tauKoideprediction], [\ref=tauRosenprediction]) should not be sought at the high-mass scale of some grand unified theory (see eg. [\cite=Mohapatra]).

Extending the scheme to the quark sector

If there is some physical reason behind the appearance of simple numbers such as 1 and 2 / 9 in the charged-lepton sector, one would expect its analogs working in the quark and neutrino sectors as well. However, it is known that the original Koide formula ([\ref=KoideFormula]) does not work when replacing the charged-lepton masses with those of neutrinos or quarks. For neutrinos one estimates directly from experiment that kν  ≤  0.81 [\cite=RodejohannZhang] (the mathematically allowed region being [formula]). For quarks, using their mass values appropriate at μ  =  2 ~ GeV, one obtains kD  ≈  1.08 (kU  ≈  1.25) for the down (up) quarks respectively [\cite=RodejohannZhang] [\cite=XingZhang]. If a higher energy scale μ = MZ is taken, even larger values are obtained, i.e. kD = 1.12 and kU = 1.29. Going from μ = 2 ~ GeV towards the low energy scale leads to smaller values of kD and kU. However, the top quark mass is so large that one certainly cannot bring kU into the vicinity of 1.

On the other hand, it has been observed recently [\cite=ZenKoide1] from the quark sector analogs of Eq. ([\ref=tandeltaL]) that at the low-energy scale the relevant phase parameters acquire approximate values:

[formula]

Due to the problem of quark confinement we obviously cannot check how precise the above equalities are. However, given the accuracy of their lepton counterpart (Eq. ([\ref=tauRosenprediction])) we may expect that they are nearly exact. Therefore, we will assume this from now on and conjecture that at the low energy scale the charged-lepton and quark mass bases are characterised by Eqs. ([\ref=deltaL29], [\ref=deltaUD]).

The problem then remains how to interpret the value of kL = 1 and how it should be generalized to the quark sector. Here we accept the suggestion of ref. [\cite=Gerard] that kf = 1 is a feature of the weak basis. Thus, according to [\cite=Gerard], the masses of charged leptons are described by kL = 1 because for charged leptons the mass and the weak bases coincide. The lepton mixing matrix (for simplicity we assume here Dirac neutrino masses), i.e.

[formula]

is then wholly assigned to the contribution from neutrinos (for which kν  ≠  1):

[formula]

In other words, if UL were different from 1, one would not expect the simplicity of Koide's formula to persist.

Since the analogs of the charged-lepton equality kL = 1 do not hold in the U and D quark sectors, one expects that the quark counterpart of the decomposition ([\ref=leptondecomposition]) will be also modified. Thus, in the CKM matrix

[formula]

both of the factor matrices UU and UD are expected to be different from 1.

For fermion type f the general connection between the mass and the weak bases is

[formula]

where M is the mass matrix in the weak basis. In the above formula [formula], while Uf,right may be chosen equal to 1. As a result, in the weak basis one deals with 'pseudo-masses' fj defined as [\cite=Gerard]

[formula]

For charged leptons (f = L, UL = 1) these pseudo-masses coincide with the observed masses, i.e. Lj = |mLj|. On the other hand, for quarks (f = D,U with UD,UU  ≠  1) the pseudo-masses are different from the observed mass values. It is for these 'pseudo-masses' that, according to the proposal of [\cite=Gerard], the analogs of Koide's formula ([\ref=KoideFormula]) are supposed to hold with kD = kU = 1. The authors of ref. [\cite=Gerard] used quark masses at the Z mass scale and found that it is possible to get kD = kU  ≈  1 provided one takes a value of the strange quark mass ms(Z) that is larger by a factor of 2.5 (!) from the theoretical estimate at that scale. Since the Koide and the Brannen-Rosen observations work best at the low-energy scale (and not at the Z mass), and since at the low-energy scale the masses of quarks (and especially ms, see [\cite=ZenKoide1]) are naturally expected to be larger than at the Z mass, a question appears if it is possible to recover Koide's formula for quarks using low-energy quark masses corresponding to phases of formulas ([\ref=deltaUD]). This is the question asked here. Thus, the present paper constitutes a low-energy-scale study of the idea of ref.[\cite=Gerard].

The structure of Uf in the quark sector

As the assumption of Koide's formula for pseudo-masses imposes constraints upon matrices UD and UU (and, consequently, upon VCKM), we have to discuss these matrices in some detail.

In [\cite=FritzschXing1] Fritzsch and Xing convincingly argued that the hierarchical structure of quark mass terms suggests certain particular parametrizations of UD and UU as 'most physical' (i.e. that it selects one of the nine possible parametrizations of the VCKM matrix [\cite=FritzschXing2] as probably the most suitable for the description of the quark-mixing phenomenon). The same parametrization was also advocated in ref. [\cite=Gerard] where the conjecture that Koide's formula holds in the weak basis was originally formulated. Consequently, we think that it is justified to accept the Fritzsch-Xing parametrization here. The relevant 'natural' parametrizations of UD and UU are then:

[formula]

with ([formula], [formula])

[formula]

Thus, the induced parametrization of the VCKM matrix can be read from:

[formula]

The product [formula] may be written in the form of Eq. ([\ref=R23form]) with a single phase φ  =  φb  -  φt and a single rotation angle θ  =  θb  -  θt, (with [formula], [formula])

[formula]

The CKM matrix is then parametrized as

[formula]

Since quark fields can be freely rephased, all of the three angles θd,θu,θ can be arranged to lie in the first quadrant so that su,sd,s and cu,cd,c are all positive (the phase φ cannot be so restricted).

We use the following absolute values of the elements of the CKM matrix most relevant for our parametrization [\cite=PDG]:

[formula]

Inserting the above numbers, we find from ([\ref=CKMparametrization]):

[formula]

Since formula ([\ref=pseudomasses]) involves absolute values, the actual sizes of φb and φt and, consequently, the experimentally imposed restriction on the CP-violating phase parameter φ  =  φb  -  φt are irrelevant for our purposes.

Imposing Koide's condition on pseudo-masses

The values of δD = 4 / 27 and δU = 2 / 27, together with the low-energy ratios ms / md = 20.4, mu / md = 0.56 (see e.g. [\cite=Weinberg]) suffice to fix the pattern of low-energy quark masses up to two overall mass scales (in the up and down sectors). These scales are irrelevant for the discussion of Koide's formulas for pseudo-masses. For illustrative purposes, however, one may set ms = 160.0 ~ MeV and mt = 172000 ~ MeV. This choice leads to the following representative values of low-energy quark masses (in MeV):

[formula]

For a given value of kf, with φb, φt dropping from expression ([\ref=pseudomasses]) for the pseudo-masses, the condition

[formula]

imposes two constraints: between θd and θb in the down quark sector, and between θu and θt in the up quark sector. Thus, θb becomes dependent on θd (and θt on θu). For kD = kU = 1 there are two possible solutions for function θb(θd) and two possible solutions for function θt(θu). They are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1] with solid lines marked as θb,n and θt,n (n = 1,2). However, only the combination θKoide  =  θb,1  -  θt,1 is positive. Specifically, taking the central experimental values of θu and θd, one finds

[formula]

which is only slightly different from the value given in Eq. ([\ref=anglesexp]).

A question thus emerges how big a departure of kD,kU from 1 is needed to fit the current experimental value of θ. The dashed lines in Fig. [\ref=fig1] correspond to θb,1 and θt,1 as obtained for kD = kU = 1.015. The predicted value of θ is then [formula], which is in good agreement with experiment. For completeness, we also show the contour plot of θ as a function of θd and θu for kD = kU = 1 (Fig. [\ref=fig2]a) and kD = kU = 1.015 (Fig. [\ref=fig2]b). Dashed lines correspond to contours [formula] (with [formula]).

Although it might seem that the above results indicate that one cannot obtain kU = kD = 1, this is not the case. One has to remember that while parametrizations ([\ref=UdUuparametrizations]) have been suggested as the most appropriate ones [\cite=FritzschXing1], they may be 'naturally' modified. Indeed, the same VCKM is obtained if one substitutes UD  →  U'D = WDUD and UU  →  U'U = WUUU, provided WD and WU denote the same arbitrary unitary matrix. If WD  ≠  WU, but both WD and WU are very close to 1, a minor modification of our results is expected. Such a natural modification of UD(U) = RD(U)23RD(U)12 is obtained if we put WD(U) = RD(U)13(θD(U)13) with very small θD13  ≠  θU13. Since the inclusion of two new parameters θD(U)13 introduces additional freedom into the scheme, it does not make sense to study it here. However - keeping this freedom in mind - the parametrization of Eq.([\ref=UdUuparametrizations]) and our numerical results may be viewed as capturing the dominant effects only.

In conclusion, the data are consistent with the statement that low-energy quark masses satisfy phase relations δD = 2δU = 4 / 27, while the expected Koide relations kU = kD  =  1 hold approximately for masses transformed to the weak basis, as suggested in [\cite=Gerard]. These observations might be relevant for a future theory of mass.
