Relaxation dynamics of conserved quantities in a weakly non-integrable one-dimensional Bose gas

Introduction

In their seminal experiment on one dimensional interacting cold atomic gases, Kinoshita et al. [\cite=weiss] argued for the possibility that the relaxational dynamics of such gases possessed memory of the gases' initial condition. Specifically, they observed that the momentum distribution of the gas did not rapidly evolve to a thermal equilibrium state, despite the presence of interactions between the gas' atoms. To explain this behavior, they conjectured that the gas possessed non-trivial conserved integrals of motion (beyond the energy of the gas), and that these integrals of motion were controlling the long time dynamics of the gas. These non-trivial integrals of motion should exist, they argued, because the underlying theoretical description of the gas, the Lieb-Liniger model, is known to be exactly solvable and has an infinite set of such integrals [\cite=ll] [\cite=korepin]. In subsequent work Rigol et al. [\cite=rigol] sharpened this conjecture by arguing that while the gas did relax to a state governed by a thermodynamic ensemble, this ensemble was not the canonical (or microcanonical), but an ensemble aware of these additional integrals of motion, an ensemble they dubbed the generalized Gibbs ensemble.

In subsequent work this ensemble has been shown to govern the dynamics of a number of systems characterized by sets of non-trivial conserved quantities, both non-interacting [\cite=barthel] [\cite=caza] [\cite=caza1] [\cite=essler] [\cite=rossini] and interacting [\cite=fior_muss] [\cite=NRG4]. However less studied has been the question of thermalization when the system has a set of weakly broken integrals of motion [\cite=yur_ols] [\cite=canovi] [\cite=kollar]. Does the weak breaking of the integrals of motion always lead to eventual thermalization of the gas as governed by the canonical ensemble? Is there a time scale of integrability breaking, τIB, for which for times t  <  τIB the dynamics appear integrable while for times t > τIB, the dynamics are governed by the standard thermodynamic ensembles? Or is there a smooth crossover in thermalization as suggested in [\cite=yur_ols] [\cite=kollar] [\cite=canovi], where physical quantities interpolate between their values under the generalized Gibbs ensemble and their values in the canonical ensemble?

It is with these questions in mind that we study the following quantum quench problem. We begin by considering a one dimensional atomic Bose gas of N particles in a system of length L in the presence of a one-body parabolic trap, Vpara(x) = mω2x2 / 2. We describe the gas with the Hamiltonian,

[formula]

where we work in units of 2m = . HLL is the well known Lieb-Liniger model [\cite=ll] with interaction strength c. We prepare the system in the ground state of this Hamiltonian, H. At t = 0 we remove the parabolic trap. In the absence of the parabolic trap, the Hamiltonian (now just the Lieb-Liniger model itself) is integrable, and we expect the subsequent dynamics of the gas to be governed by the non-trivial conserved charges in the system. If instead of simply removing the trap, we replace it with a different one-body potential, V cos(x) = A cos (ωx), we break integrability, so changing the nature of the post-quench dynamics. By varying the amplitude A of this potential, we control the amount of integrability breaking in the system and its concomitant effects on the dynamics. This quantum quench is illustrated in Fig. 1.

To study these dynamics, we employ a combination of Bethe ansatz solvability and a numerical renormalization group. The Lieb-Liniger model is a model that can be solved with the Bethe ansatz, both determining its spectra [\cite=ll] and its matrix elements [\cite=1989_Slavnov_TMP_79_82]. Because we can compute matrix elements, we can compute correlations functions of this model using their Lehmann representations [\cite=caux] [\cite=cc]. This however is computationally intensive. In order to accomplish this task we employ an optimized set of routines known as ABACUS [\cite=caux].

Because we are interested in perturbing the gas by introducing integrability breaking one-body potentials, both pre- and post-quench, the solvability of the Lieb-Liniger model is insufficient for the task at hand. Instead to study such deformations, we employ a numerical renormalization group (NRG) [\cite=NRG] [\cite=NRG1] [\cite=NRG2] [\cite=NRG3] [\cite=NRG4] able to study perturbations of integrable and conformal continuum field theories. This approach, as it is an extension of a methodology known as the truncated conformal spectrum approach [\cite=YZ] [\cite=YZ1], has been primarily used to study perturbations of relativistic field theories [\cite=NRG] [\cite=NRG1] [\cite=NRG2] [\cite=NRG3], but has recently been applied to the Lieb-Liniger model perturbed by a one-body potential [\cite=NRG4], the problem at hand. The NRG uses the eigenstates of the Lieb-Liniger model as a computational basis. Because this basis accounts for the interactions of the Bose gas particles with one another, this numerical method builds in the strong correlations present in the problem right at the start.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we demonstrate that we can compute the equilibrium properties of the gas in the one-body potentials. While we have shown in Ref. [\cite=NRG4] that we can accurately describe the ground state and first few excited states in such a potential, here we show that we can obtain with reasonably accuracy a wide range of the spectrum. This will be important for the determination of the post-quench time evolution of the Lieb-Liniger conserved charges. In Section 3, we consider the evolution of the expectation values of these charges. This will allow us to begin to understand the consequences of integrability breaking. In Section 4, we discuss these results briefly and examine possible further directions for this work.

Equilibrium properties of the gas in the one-body potentials

In this section we demonstrate that we can compute the equilibrium properties of the gas in the one-body potentials necessary to describe the dynamics of the system post-quench. We first show that we can prepare the initial state, the ground state of the gas in the presence of the parabolic potential, Vpara, accurately. To this end we show in the central panel of Fig. 2 the density profile, ρ(x), of the gas in this trap. We see that we get good agreement between the NRG numerics for N = L = 14,c = 7200 and an analytical computation of the density profile of the gas in its Tonks-Girardeau limit (c =   ∞  ). Such analytics are possible because the gas, for certain quantities such as ρ(x), can be treated as equivalent to free fermions. In Fig. 2 (right panel) we also demonstrate that we can accurately compute the density profile of the gas in a cosine potential.

However in order to compute post-quench dynamics, we need to be able to describe not only the ground state in the cosine potential, but some large number of excited states. In our quench protocol, we take as our initial t = 0 state the ground state of the gas in the parabolic potential, |ψGS,para〉. If we can compute a wide range of eigenstates in the cosine potential, both ground and excited states, |ψα, cos〉, we can expand this initial state in terms of the post-quench basis:

[formula]

Of course for this expansion to be exact, we would need to know all of the eigenstates of the gas in the parabolic potential. We will instead settle for a determination of the post-quench eigenbasis that allows us to include enough states so that [formula].

Because we use the eigenstates of the Lieb-Liniger model absent a one-body potential, |ψα,LL〉, as the computational basis of the NRG, the NRG gives any eigenstate in a one-body potential as a linear combination of such states:

[formula]

Each Lieb-Liniger state |ψ〉α,LL is characterized by N-rapidities, [formula]. These rapidities govern the energy, Eα, and momentum, Pα, of the state (relative to the Hamiltonian, HLL):

[formula]

These rapidities are found as solutions of the Bethe equations:

[formula]

In the limit of c = 0, we see that the Bethe equations collapse to the momentum quantization condition for a particle in a periodic system of length L.

In computing the spectrum of states in the cosine potential, we employ the variant of the NRG discussed in Ref. [\cite=NRG2]. The NRG in its plain vanilla formulation [\cite=NRG] can compute the spectrum of the low lying states of the gas in the one-body potential [\cite=NRG4]. But to capture accurately an appreciable fraction of the spectrum, we need to employ a sweeping routine [\cite=NRG2] analogous to that used in the finite volume routine of the density matrix renormalization group [\cite=DMRG].

In Fig. 3 we present the results for the spectrum of the gas in the V cos(x) =  cos (4πx / L) (A = 1) as computed with the NRG and with analytics in the c =   ∞   limit. We see we are able to describe accurately a wide range of the spectrum. For higher energy states, there are some slight differences between analytics and the NRG which we believe can be ascribed to 1 / c corrections, which while small are still present.

Post-quench dynamics of conserved charges

In this section we consider the time evolution of the Lieb-Liniger conserved quantities, Qn. These quantities commute with the Lieb-Liniger Hamiltonian,

[formula]

Q(t) = 〈 ψ(t)|Q|ψ(t)〉,

[formula]

Discussion and future directions

In this brief report we have considered post-quench dynamics of a cold atomic gas quenched from its ground state in a parabolic trap to a cosine shaped trap. To characterize these dynamics we have investigated the time dependency of the Lieb-Liniger conserved quantities induced by the presence of the post-quench integrability breaking cosine. In the presence of integrability breaking, the charges oscillate about a mean. This mean behaves smoothly as a function of the strength of integrability breaking, the amplitude, A, of the cosine. Similarly the amplitude of the oscillations go smoothly to zero as A is reduced to zero. However for the frequency of the oscillations of the charges this is not the case. Instead this frequency is related directly to the cosine potential's own frequency, which in our quench protocol is kept constant.

Our findings for the behavior of the charges are then in accordance with Ref. [\cite=yur_ols] [\cite=kollar] [\cite=canovi], namely we find that the introduction of integrability breaking leads to a smooth interpolation of the expectations values of observables (here the charges) between that in the integrable limit and that in the fully chaotic limit where the standard thermodynamic ensembles govern dynamics. However we also find that the time scale, τIB, for integrability breaking is not necessarily associated with the strength of the integrability breaking. We find rather that the charges oscillate with a frequency independent of the amplitude of the one-body cosine potential. This suggests the intriguing possibility that even relatively large integrability breaking terms, if suitably low-frequency, might lead to long thermalization times before completely chaotic behavior is observed.

In future work we intend to explore these questions in terms of the momentum distribution function (MDF) of the gas. The long time behavior of the MDF is considerably more complicated to compute than the time dependency of the charges. In the presence of integrability breaking, it requires one to compute a large number of matrix elements of the form,

[formula]

where ψ(x) is the Bose field operator. Each of these matrix elements is evaluated by inserting a resolution of the identity between the fields ψ, itself a computationally intensive task [\cite=cc]. Having already carried out preliminary computations for systems sizes of N = L = 14, we nonetheless expect to be able to perform these calculations for system sizes of up to N  ~  25 - 30.
