Anisotropic Dirac electronic structures of AMnBi2 (A=Sr, Ca)

Introduction

Low energy electrons obeying the relativistic Dirac equation have been reported in so-called Dirac materials such as graphene.[\cite=natmat-geim] [\cite=prl-theo] Many intriguing physical properties of Dirac fermions have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally, including the unconventional quantum Hall effect, Klein tunneling, suppressed back scattering, and so on.[\cite=rev-graph] Dirac materials are also reported in topological insulators,[\cite=TI] [\cite=TI1] [\cite=TI2] iron pnictides,[\cite=FeSC] [\cite=FeSC1] organic conductors,[\cite=orgcon] inverse perovskite,[\cite=invper] and the VO2-TiO2 interface,[\cite=Pick2009] with the list is rapidly growing these days. The effective Hamiltonian in all those systems is characterized by the Pauli matrices, which is essential to manifest spinor-related phenomena.

Recently, an anisotropic Dirac cone in SrMnBi2 was found by a density functional theory (DFT) calculation and confirmed by angle revolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillations.[\cite=Park2012] It is characterized by linear dispersions with strong anisotropy in the momentum-dependent Fermi velocity. Such a Dirac band near the Fermi level mainly results from the Bi square net layer,[\cite=Moro2011] and is responsible for a finite Berry phase in the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations[\cite=Park2012] and the linear-field dependence of the magnetoresistance.[\cite=Petro-Sr] Similar behavior was also found in CaMnBi2 with the same Bi square net.[\cite=Petro-Ca] [\cite=Chen2012] This indicates that the low energy electron motion in the Bi square net can be described by the Dirac Hamiltonian. So far, however, the origin of the Dirac fermions in the Bi squre net has not yet been investigated clearly. So, this paper is devoted to studying the origin of the anisotropic Dirac electrons observed in SrMnBi2 and CaMnBi2.

This paper is organized as follows. Section II explains the crystal structure of the two compounds and the details of the DFT calculation. In Section III, the DFT band structures containing the Dirac dispersion are presented. In Section IV, we clarify the mechanism of the anisotropic Dirac dispersion as well as the chirality of the Dirac electron by using a tight binding (TB) method. Also, the effect of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of heavy Bi atoms will be investigated. Finally, we conclude our paper in Section V.

Calculation method

Figure 1 shows the crystal structures of SrMnBi2 (SG 139, I4/mmm) and CaMnBi2 (SG 129, P4/nmm). Both compounds contain a square net of Bi atoms which are indicated by the red (dark gray) balls. The Sr or Ca atoms are located at the pyramid top of four base Bi atoms, where the vertical distance varies from 2.5 to 2.7 Å. Each Sr or Ca layer has a checkerboard ordering with respect to the Bi square net. There exist other buffer layers containing Mn-Bi tetrahedrons. So there are two types of Bi atoms in the unit cell: Bi(1) in the square net and Bi(2) in the Mn-Bi layer.

The stacking configuration of the two alkaline earth atomic layers above and below the Bi square net is different for SrMnBi2 from that of CaMnBi2. As one can see in Fig. 1 or more schematically in Fig. 5, each Sr (Ca) of one side appears at the overlapped (alternate) position of the same element at the other side. Due to this difference, SrMnBi2 (CaMnBi2) has a body-centered (primitive) tetragonal Bravais lattice. The experimental structural parameters of CaMnBi2 and SrMnBi2 are listed in Table I.

The band structure calculations are performed with the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method implemented in the WIEK2K package.[\cite=wien2k] The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) is used for the exchange-correlation potential.[\cite=pbe] The radius of the muffin-tin is set to 2.5 a.u. for all atoms. For the charge self-consistent calculation, the number of [formula] points used in the full Brillouin zone is 1000. Due to the magnetic Mn ions, the spin polarized calculation is carried out. Also the SOC is considered due to the presence of heavy Bi atom.

DFT results

In AMnBi2 (A=Sr and Ca), Mn2 + has a 3d5 electron configuration. The calculated spin magnetic moment within the muffin-tin sphere is about 4 μB for both compounds, which shows negligible changes under different magnetic configurations of Mn spins. In order to find the magnetic ground state, the total energies are calculated for various magnetic configurations such as ferromagnetic (FM), checkerboard-type antiferromagnetic (cAFM), and the stripe-type antiferromagnetic (sAFM) configurations. Their relative energies are listed in Table II. The ground state is found to be cAFM for both CaMnBi2 and SrMnBi2. The relative stability listed in Table II is qualitatively consistent with the literature.[\cite=Moro2011] The associated cAFM transition will be related to the magnetic transition observed at ~   290 K in the experiments.[\cite=Park2012] Under the cAFM order, the interlayer exchange interaction is so weak due to the large MnBi interlayer distance, and its contribution is as small as the order of magnitude of the energy tolerance (~   1 meV/f.u.). In our calculation we assumed an antiferromagnetic interlayer ordering of the Mn spins along the z axis, which does not alter the main feature of the band structures. The total energy difference in Table II remains almost the same when taking into consideration the SOC.

As explained, two Sr (or Mn-Bi(2)) layers adjacent to the Bi(1) square net in SrMnBi2 overlap when projected along the z axis, while the adjacent Ca layers are alternate in CaMnBi2. The total energy calculation is consistent with the experimental observation that SrMnBi2 favors the overlapping type, while CaMnBi2 favors the alternate type. So it is likely that the stacking type is mainly determined by the ionic size. Interestingly, another structurally related compound SrMnSb2 with the same stacking type as CaMnBi2 is known to exhibit the chain-type reconstruction of the Sb square net.[\cite=srmnsb2] However, CaMnBi2 does not show any distortion in the Bi square net. The absence of such distortion in the Bi square net in CaMnBi2 is mainly due to the SOC. In fact we found that soft phonon modes of 42 cm- 1 (5.3 meV) lead to a chain-type reconstruction in CaMnBi2 without including the SOC, but they disappear when the SOC is included. Thus, strong SOC has an important role in the suppression of the chain-type distortion in CaMnBi2.

Figure 2 shows the calculated band structures of SrMnBi2 and CaMnBi2 both without and with the SOC. Both compounds show spin-polarized Mn-driven bands near - 3.0 eV and 1.0 eV with majority and minority spins, respectively. As indicated by the size of the points, the bands near the Fermi level arise mostly from the Bi(1) p orbitals which are weakly hybridized with Sr or Ca d orbitals. Near the Fermi level, two linear bands cross at a certain wavevector, [formula], along Γ to M. When the SOC is included, the two linearly crossing bands change to quasi-linear bands with a small SOC-induced gap of 0.05 eV. The SOC-induced gap is much larger at the X point, so most of the states near the X point are removed from the Fermi level. This is because the electronic states have a smaller energy difference near the X point than [formula], and thus the SOC splitting is more sensitive to the nonvanishing SOC interaction. This will be shown more clearly in Section IV.C, based on the TB analysis and perturbation theory.

The linearly crossing bands in SrMnBi2 and CaMnBi2 have been ascribed to the observed Dirac fermion-like dispersion. [\cite=Petro-Ca] [\cite=Chen2012] [\cite=Moro2011] [\cite=Park2012] [\cite=Petro-Sr] [\cite=Pero-magtherm] In Fig. 3, we show the energy dispersion near the Dirac point at [formula] without including the SOC. Here k1 and k2 are defined by [formula] and [formula], where (kx,ky) corresponds to (0,0) and (π / a,π / a) at the Γ and M points, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the anisotropy, i.e., the ratio of Fermi velocities along the k1 and k2 directions, is as high as 50. Also the hole and electron bands touch at the Dirac point. In the case of CaMnBi2, shown in Fig. 3(b), the overall features in the energy dispersion near [formula] are similar to those of SrMnBi2. However the gap introduced by the hybridization with the states from the alkaline earth atoms is rather different in CaMnBi2. For SrMnBi2, the zero-energy gap is found only at the [formula] point between Γ and M, while it is found along a continuous line in the momentum space for CaMnBi2. These reflect the important role of the arrangement of the alkaline earth atoms with respect to the Bi square net, which will be discussed in detail in Section IV.A. In addition, when the SOC is included, a small gap is introduced at the Dirac point as mentioned above. However, the essential feature of the anisotropic Dirac dispersion is maintained.

Figure 4 shows the calculated Fermi surfaces by considering the SOC. Near Γ, hole pockets exist in both compounds. Around X or [formula], there are strongly anisotropic pockects caused by the Dirac bands for SrMnBi2 and CaMnBi2. Also, these are highly two-dimensional, which is consistent with the result of Fig. 2 that the Dirac band is mainly caused by Bi px and py orbitals. Such Dirac fermions are supposed to dominate the transport property mainly because of their high Fermi velocities. From our calculation, the carrier type near the X point is the electron type, and near the [formula] point, the hole type. Since the hole pocket at [formula] in SrMnBi2 is absent in CaMnBi2, the hole carrier density is greater in SrMnBi2 than CaMnBi2. This may be related to an experimental result that positive (negative) thermopower is observed in SrMnBi2 (CaMnBi2).[\cite=Pero-magtherm]

TB analysis

Our ab initio band structures for SrMnBi2 and CaMnBi2 indicate that the Dirac-like dispersion is mainly caused by the Bi(1) px and py orbitals. Depending on the stacking of Sr or Ca, they show a Dirac point or a continuous band crossing line. In order to understand the main mechanism for the different band structures, we carried out a TB analysis on both CaMnBi2 and SrMnBi2. We construct the TB Hamiltonian of the Bi square net with and without including the interaction with the Sr or Ca atom, and discuss the mechanism for the Dirac-like electronic structures. Also the chiral nature of the Dirac electron as well as the effect of the SOC are investigated.

Bi square net with [formula] unit cell

Figure 5 represents the Bi square lattice interacting with the Sr or Ca atoms. Because of the unit cell doubling due to the Sr or Ca atoms, there are two Bi atoms at (0,0,0) and (a / 2,a / 2,0) in the primitive unit cell with the lattice constant a. They are denoted by BiA and BiB, respectively. First, we study the pristine Bi square net without considering the Sr or Ca atoms. From the DFT result in the absence of the SOC, we have checked that the linearly crossing bands are mainly dominated by the Bi px and py orbitals, so we ignore the pz orbital in the TB analysis. Using the relevant px and py orbitals of each Bi atom as basis, the Bloch function is

[formula]

where [formula] is given by (a/2,a/2,0). [formula] and [formula] are the atomic px and py orbitals at the Bii atom with i = A and B. We use an orthogonal basis set and consider the nearest neighbor interaction only. The resulting TB Hamiltonian for each [formula] has following form of dimension 4. Here εp is the onsite energy of the px and py orbitals. The hopping term Vαβ is

[formula]

where [formula] means a summation over the four nearest neighbors. Employing the Slater-Koster parametrization,[\cite=SK] we obtain Vαβ:

[formula]

Here, t1π and t1σ are the hopping parameters for the π and σ bonds.

One can express H0 in a simpler form by using the 2×  2 identity matrix I and the Pauli matrix σx. The orbitals in the two Bi types interact only through the off-diagonal blocks VxxI  +  Vxyσx whose eigenvalues are Vxx  +  γorbVxy with the relative phase γorb  =    ±  1 between the px and py orbitals. Thus the eigenvalues of H0 can be written as εp  +  γatom(Vxx  +  γorbVxy), where γatom  =    ±  1 denotes the relative phase between the two Bi types.

We estimated the values of t1σ and t1π as having a good agreement with the DFT band structures. The DFT calculation of the Bi square net was performed by considering well separated layers of the Bi square net, and the result is shown in Fig. 6(a). Bi px and py driven DFT band structures are well reproduced by using t1σ = 2.0 eV, t1π =  - 0.5 eV. The TB band structure with εp = 0 is shown in Fig. 6(b). Additional DFT bands from the pz obital crossing the Fermi level are not considered in this TB analysis.

The linear crossing at the Fermi level is found in Fig. 6(b) due to a folding of the px and py bands from two Bi atoms. Such degeneracy appears at every [formula] point in the Fermi level and produces a line-shape FS shown in Fig. 6(c). So the unit-cell doubling in the Bi square net makes the conduction and valence bands touch each other on the whole Fermi surface.

We now consider Sr atoms located at (0,a / 2,  ±  c) in the unit cell, as shown in Fig. 5(a). According to the DFT results of SrMnBi2, it is mainly the Sr d orbitals which participate in the hybridization with the Bi p band near the Fermi level. The major contribution of the Sr d orbitals comes from the z2 (~  20%) and xz  /  yz (~  50%) orbitals, but there are also non-negligible contributions from x2  -  y2 and xy (~  30%). So we consider all five d obritals for the TB Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltonian matrix of the SrBi lattice, whose dimemsion is 14, is given below involving H0. Here, εd denotes the onsite energy of the Sr d orbital, and I is the 10×  10 identity matrix. VSrBi, the hopping term between the Sr d and Bi p orbitals, is the 4×  10 matrix listed in Table III.

Fig. 7(a) shows the DFT band structure of the SrBi layer, again adopting periodic boundary condition along the z-direction with enough of a vacuum region. We choose εd  =  4 eV to represent the Sr d states in the TB Hamiltonian, and uσ  =  1.5 eV, uπ  =   - 0.5 eV in VSrBi. As shown in Fig. 7(b), a qualitative agreement between the DFT and the TB results is obtained. Around the linear crossing point, denoted by the circle in Fig. 7(b), the energy surfaces of two bands are plotted in Fig. 7(c). One can see that the degeneracy along the band crossing line is lifted except one point which induces the anisotropic Dirac cone, as is clearly shown in Fig. 7(c). The anisotropy of the momentum-dependent Fermi velocity is estimated to within an order of 10, as shown in Fig. 7(d).

In the description of CaMnBi2, the Ca atoms are located at (a / 2,0,c) and (0,a / 2, - c), as shown in Fig. 5(b). Similarly, the Ca d orbitals are hybridized with the Bi p orbitals. So a 14×  14 TB Hamiltonian HCaBi is given below with the onsite energy εd of the Ca d orbital. The matrix elements of VCaBi are listed in Table IV.

In Figs. 8(a) and 8(b), we compare the band structures obtained by the DFT and TB methods, respectively. Qualitative agreement is obtained by using the TB parameters uσ = 1.2 eV, uπ =  - 0.5 eV, and εd  =  4 eV. In contrast to the SrBi layer, the degeneracy along the line-type FS is not lifted, as can be seen from Fig. 8(c). Fig. 8(d) clearly shows the almost zero gap along the continuous line (k0  +  δk,k0  -  δk).

The distinct electronic structures between the SrBi and the CaBi lattices arise from the different arrangements of the alkaline earth atoms with respect to the Bi square net. This can be understood using perturbation theory for the first-order degenerate states. The two degenerate states along (k0  +  δk,k0  -  δk) are unperturbed eigenstates. The perturbation potential [formula] by the adjacent A (=Sr or Ca) atomic layers gives the following energy eigenvalue difference (see the Appendix for a detailed derivation).

[formula]

where I2 and J2 are the coupling terms of V between the next-nearest neighboring orbitals, as illustrated in Fig. 9. When two A atomic layers have overlapped stacking as in the case of SrBi, the perturbation V results in I2  ≠  J2 as shown in Fig. 9(a). For this reason, a linear dispersion of δε is obtained along (k0  +  δk,k0  -  δk). This is consistent with the anisotropic Dirac cone feature of SrMnBi2. But, when two A atomic layers have alternate stacking as in CaBi, I2 - J2 = 0, as is shown in Fig. 9(b). This causes δε = 0. So the degeneracy is not lifted, which is consistent with the result for CaMnBi2.

Chirality of Dirac electrons

In the anisotropic Dirac band of the SrBi lattice, the original two bands in the folded zone are associated with symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of two Bi sublattice orbitals. In other words, the eigenstate is (φAx  +  γorbφAy) + (φBx  +  γorbφBy) at a certain k on one side of the Dirac point, while it is (φAx  +  γorbφAy) - (φBx  +  γorbφBy) on the other side. A state with γatom = 1 needs to be changed continuously to another state with γatom =  - 1 around the Dirac point. If we associate γatom  =    ±  1 with up/down spinor states, the momentum k and the (pseudo)spinor are coupled to each other, giving rise to a specific chirality. Together with the linear variation of the energy eigenvalues with [formula], this coupling is generally described by the Weyl equation, which involves the Pauli matrices σx,σy,σz. Such a Hamiltonian gives a value for Berry's phase of π when a state is scattered back to the original [formula] state while going around [formula]. For this reason, the back scattering is suppressed, as is known for graphene and materials with strong spin-orbit couplings.[\cite=Ando] This also can explain the abnormal phase observed in the quantum oscillation experiments.

In order to study the chirality, we express an eigenstate as a superposition of φ1  =  φAx  +  γorbφAy, φ2  =  φBx  +  γorbφBy, that is, [formula]. One needs to find a unitary matrix that transforms φ1  ±  φ2 into spinor states with [formula]. Such a transformation T is given by For a given [formula], one obtains the expectation values of σα as [formula] with α = x,y,z. For α = x,z, they are evaluated as [formula], [formula]. For α = y, [formula], which vanishes as long as d1, d2 have the same imanginary value. Near the Dirac point, we calculate [formula] for each of the hole and electron TB states, to represent two-component vector fields (nx,nz). As shown in Fig. 10(a), there are four Dirac points in the first Brillouin zone, (  ±  k0,  ±  k0) with k0 > 0. Also we define local k1 and k2 axes for each Dirac point as indicated in Fig. 10(a). As a function of k1 and k2, the vector field (nx,nz) is represented in Figs. 10(b) and 10(c). For all cases, the vector rotates by 2π along the closed [formula] loop, i.e., it has a winding number of 1. Also when k2 = 0, the hole is purely a [formula] state at negative (positive) k1 as we expect, but it is reversed for the electron case. So the chirality is the opposite for the hole state from the electron state. From Fig. 10(b), the arrow rotates clockwise as one follows the contour line counter-clockwise in both hole and electron states around (k0, k0) or (- k0, - k0). In contrast, around (- k0, k0) or (k0, - k0), the rotation is the opposite, as shown in Fig. 10(c).

One can construct the effective Hamiltonian [formula] as a function of [formula] where [formula] with α = x,y,z are the velocity parameters and σ0 is the unit matrix.[\cite=PRL] [\cite=JPSJ] Nonvanishing [formula] means the tilting of the Dirac cone, i.e., electron-hole asymmetry. For the case of SrBi without an SOC, [formula], we simply use the (nx,nz) results of Fig. 10 and assume an ideal elliptical shape for the energy contours in the limit k1,k2  →  0 in order to obtain an approximate form of Heff as below. where v1 and v2 are the Fermi velocities along the local unit vectors in the k1 and k2 directions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10(d), positive (negative) eigenvalues of Heff make up the upper (lower) part of the anisotropic Dirac cone. By fitting to the TB results, the absolute magnitudes of v1 and v2 are approximately 16 and 0.4 eV/(2π / a), respectively. The sign of v1 is always positive, but v2 > 0 near ±  (k0,k0) and v2 < 0 near ±  ( - k0,k0).

Spin-orbit coupling

The spin-orbit interaction is typically described by the following potential. Replacing the radial integration by an effective constant λSO, we assume [formula].

The TB band structure of the single layer Bi square net is calculated with an additional term HSO. The matrix elements of [formula] need to be found in the φx,y,z basis, instead of usual spherical harmonics representation, Yml. By using the relationships [formula], [formula], φz = Y01, we can express HSO in terms of the following basis for each of Bii (i = A and B), where [formula] indicates the spin. With this basis, we obtain 6  ×  6 HSO for each atom.

[formula]

HSO is added to the 12  ×  12 H0 which additionally takes into account the pz orbital and the spin degree of freedom. The calculatd TB band structure is shown by the solid line in Fig. 11(b), where λSO = 0.6, εx,y = 0.0, εz =  - 0.5. Also we have used t1z cos (kxa / 2) cos (kya / 2) with t1z = 2t1π =  - 1 for the π interaction between φAz and φBz. Excellent agreement with the DFT band structure is shown in Fig. 11(a).

The SOC-induced splitting does not need to occur at every [formula] point where the px,y band crosses the pz band. In order to explain this, we show the γatom =  - 1( + 1) bands whose local orbitals are given by φAx + y  +  γatomφBx + y and φAz  +  γatomφBz without taking into consideration HSO. Those bands have no hybridization with each other, as can be seen in Fig. 11(b). Along the direction from Γ to M, each φz band crosses the φx + y bands twice. The leading contribution of the perturbation HSO is of second order, which is given by [formula]. The main factor is due to the fact that [formula] is non-vanishing only when the values of γatom are equal to each other for ψ(0)m and ψ(0)n. For this reason, H(2)SO breaks the degeneracy only at the point where two crossing bands have the same γatom.

Discussion

The linear crossing behavior along lines of high symmetry is quite common in (transition) metal compounds. But SrMnBi2 possesses distinguishing features that cause the anisotropic Dirac fermions as observed in experiments. The main factors can be summarized as follows. First, the Bi p band is folded due to the unit cell doubling. This gives rise to a linear crossing of folded bands without lifting the degeneracy, which is rather common. Second, the two-fold rotational symmetry of the perturbing potential by adjacent atomic layers lifts the degeneracy except at the Dirac point. Third, and most importantly, the anisotropic Dirac cone mainly contributes to the electronic properties at the Fermi level. We have seen that most of the other bands are absent near the Fermi level. This is because the Mn-related bands are well spin-polarized and separated away from the Fermi level due to the antiferromagnetic ordering. Also the Dirac cone exhibits an exceedingly high Fermi velocity compared to the other Fermi pockets, dominating the electron transport properties. In these respects, SrMnBi2 is quite unique.

The chirality that we obtained for SrBi, i.e., in Fig. 10, is almost identical to that of graphene. A superficial difference of SrMnBi2 from graphene is that the Dirac cone is highly anisotropic. So, the contribution of the anisotropy to the transport properties deserves further investigation. Also it is not clear how the two types of Dirac cone shown in Figs. 10(b) and 10(c) are related to each other. For example, two inequivalent Dirac cones in graphene are related by the time-reversal transformation. Furthermore, SrMnBi2 contains a significant SOC of Bi, in contrast to graphene. As one can see in Fig. 3(a), it has a sizable energy gap at the Dirac point and a significant electron-hole asymmetry due to the SOC. In such a case, Berry’s phase cannot be quantized to be β  =  π, as it is in graphene. Rather it should show a deviation from π.

We have not included the interlayer interaction in the TB calculation of the SrBi and CaBi layers. Such an omission is reasonable from the highly two dimensional nature of the Fermi surfaces in the DFT result in Fig. 4. But it is far from being a completely two dimensional system, as one can see a little dump near the kz=0 for the anisotropic Fermi pocket in Fig. 4. A slight dispersion will originate from the indirect coupling through the insulating MnBi layers. In spite of there being little interlayer interaction, the anisotropic Dirac behavior is equally reproduced by the DFT method, i.e., the DFT results shown in Figs. 3(a) and (b), in comparison with the TB results, Figs. 7(c) and 8(c), respectively. This suggests that the indirect coupling does not destroy the anisotropic Dirac nature, which explains the Dirac fermions observed in some three dimensional systems such as iron pnictides, topological insulators, organic conductors, and so on.

Conclusion

The DFT results show the presence of an anisotropic Dirac cone in SrMnBi2. But, in CaMnBi2 the band crossing occurs along a continuous line in momentum space. From the TB analysis, we conclude that the anisotropic potential created by the Sr atoms is a main factor for the anisotropic Dirac band. Our study indicates that the nature of the Dirac dispersion is sensitive to the nearest neighbor interaction in the Bi square net. So, it would be interesting to investigate the Dirac nature of the Bi square net with further changes, such as structural distortions or magnetism.

APPENDIX

A single Bi square net layer is regarded as an unperturbed system. At each [formula] with 0  ≤  kx,ky  ≤  π / a, two bands touch at the Fermi wavevectors as shown in Fig. 6(c). Their symmetries are given by γorb =  + 1 and γatom  =    ±  1. The unperturbed eigenvalues are [formula] and [formula]. The only condition for the band crossing, i.e., [formula], is that Vxx + Vyy = 0. This results in tan (kxa / 2) tan (kya / 2) = (t1σ + t1π) / (t1σ - t1π). Assuming t1π = 0 to simplify our problem, we obtain cos (kxa / 2 + kya / 2) = 0. As a result, the [formula] line of the band crossing satisfies kx + ky  =  π / a. The Dirac point [formula] has k0  =  π / 2a. Also, from γorb =  + 1, the unperturbed eigenstates can be written as a linear combination of local orbitals, such as [formula] and [formula] with the lattice vector [formula] and [formula]. So they are expressed by where γatom1 = 1 and γatom2 =  - 1 give the bonding and anti-bonding states, respectively.

Now we consider the perturbation by the additional potential of A (=Sr or Ca) atomic layers. Each A atomic potential is assumed to be an isotropic potential v(r), to give the total potential [formula] for the case illustrated in Fig. 9. In order to get the energy shift due to the perturbation, we need to evaluate the matrix elements Vij=<  ψ0i|V|ψ0j  >   for i,j = 1,2.

[formula]

By assuming a short-ranged function [formula], we consider the overlap integrals up to the second nearest neighbors, which are defined as follows.

On-site:

First nearest neighbor:

[formula]

Second nearest neighbor:

[formula]

Note that I2  ≠  J2 for the SrBi lattice, as illustrated in Fig. 9, but I2  =  J2 for the CaBi case. After a straightforward procedure, one can obtain the following matrix elements.

[formula]

Along the band crossing line with respect to the Dirac point [formula], that is, [formula], this becomes V11 = V22 = I0 with the only nontrivial element V12 = V21. Diagonalizing V gives the following energy eigenvalue shifts.

[formula]

By using [formula] and [formula], with δ  ≪  1, we obtain the following relation.
