Beyond General Relativity

To begin with we recall that recent astrophysical data are in agreement with a universe in current phase of accelerated expansion, in contrast with the predictions of Einstein gravity in FRW space-time. Most part of energy contents, roughly 75  % in the universe is due to mysterious entity with negative pressure: Dark Energy. The simplest explanation is Einstein gravity plus a small positive cosmological constant. As an alternative, one may consider more drastic modification of General Relativity: Extended Gravity Models (see, for example [\cite=Capo] [\cite=turner] [\cite=No] [\cite=fara] [\cite=ea] [\cite=seba08]). Thus, it is of some interest to investigate the existence of static spherically symmetric black hole solutions and the associated thermodynamical properties, in particular the non energy issue associated with energy.

First example: the Lovelock gravity

Lovelock gravity is an extended gravity, with higher derivative terms but in higher dimensions, and it deals only with second order partial differential equations in the metric tensor as in GR. Lovelock Lagrangian contains Euler densities

[formula]

where [formula] Riemann tensor in D-dimensions and [formula] generalized totally antisymmetric Kronecker delta. The action for Lovelock gravity is

[formula]

[formula] and am are arbitrary constants. Here,

The generic extended gravity models

What about other extended gravity models? In general, it is rather difficult to define the analogue of the quasi-local Misner-Sharp mass. However, in D = 4, for BH energy related to a class of extended gravity, one may make use of the following procedure [\cite=gorbunova]: assume to know a BH exact solution with rH depending only on a unique constant of integration C. Compute the Wald entropy: if the black hole Entropy depends only on rH, then make use of the knowledge of TH and of the Clausius Relation THdS = dE. As a result, BH energy turns out proportional to C. This proposal is supported by the derivation of the Clausius Relation from the equations of motion, and by evaluation of the BH entropy via Wald method and the Hawking temperature via the quantum mechanics techniques in curved space-time.

Second example: a class of four-dimensional F(R) modified gravity models

The action is

[formula]

F(R) is a generic function of the Ricci scalar R. The Metric Ansatz for BH solutions

[formula]

In general a(r) is non trivial. Again BH solutions exist when B(rH) = 0 with rH > 0. As already mentioned, the two relevant quantities are: the Hawking temperature

[formula]

and the BH entropy evaluated by by the Wald method, which reads

[formula]

Note that, once the BH solution is known, TH and SW can be evaluated. Now assume that rH depends only on a constant of integration C and RH = RH(rH). From equations of motion on horizon and Wald entropy and TH, one gets

[formula]

Interpretation: this is the Clausius Relation. Thus, integrating over rH, one gets the F(R)    BH energy formula n[\cite=seba]

[formula]

Several exact BH solutions are known, and one has a non trivial check of above F(R) BH energy expression and [formula]. For example, the Clifton-Barrow solution associated with F(R) = R1 + δ (see, for example [\cite=clifton] [\cite=Bel]), has been shown to satisfy the above energy formula.
