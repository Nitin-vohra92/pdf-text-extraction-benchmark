Existence of ground states for negative ions at the binding threshold

Introduction and main result

The energy of a quantum-mechanical system composed of N electrons and one fixed nucleus of charge Z > 0 is described by the Hamiltonian

[formula]

(Here we use units in which the electron mass m = 1 / 2, the electron charge e =  - 1 and Planck's constant [formula].) The terms p2i, where [formula], and - Z / |xi| describe the kinetic energy of the i-th electron and its potential energy due to the attraction to the nucleus, respectively. The term |xi - xj|- 1 stands for the potential energy due to the repulsion between the i-th and the j-th electron. The Pauli principle dictates that the Hamiltonian is considered as acting in the subspace [formula] of anti-symmetric functions in [formula], that is, ψ's satisfying

[formula]

(For the sake of simplicity, we ignore the electron spin. It can be included easily.)

The ground state energy of the system is given by the bottom of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian [\eqref=eq:hamintro]. If this bottom of the spectrum is an eigenvalue, that is, if there is an eigenfunction in [formula], then the system is said to be bound and the eigenfunction describes its ground state.

It is intuitively clear that a nucleus of charge Z can bind N electrons if Z is large compared to N, and that it cannot if Z is small compared to N. This fact can also be shown mathematically: Zhislin [\cite=Zh] proved that the system is bound if Z > N - 1 and Nam [\cite=Na] showed that the system is not bound if N  ≥  1.22Z  +  3Z1 / 3, improving the earlier condition N  ≥  2Z + 1 of [\cite=Li]. For asymptotic results as Z  →    ∞  , see, for instance, [\cite=Ru] [\cite=Si] [\cite=LiSiSiTh] [\cite=SeSiSo]. In these results, and also in our paper, we shall consider Z as an arbitrary positive (not necessarily integer) parameter. Then the cited results imply that for fixed N there is (at least one) critical value of Z where a binding-unbinding transition occurs.

In this paper we are interested in this binding-unbinding transition. More precisely, we investigate whether the system is bound at this critical Z value, that is, whether a ground state exists. Intuitively, this question is related to the size of the system. As the continuous parameter Z moves from the binding regime across the critical value into the unbinding regime, there are two possible scenarios: Either the size of the system increases indefinitely and becomes infinite as Z reaches the critical value Zc, or else the size of the system approaches a finite value at the critical value and then jumps discontinuously to infinity. The first scenario corresponds to the case where no ground state exists at the critical value, and the second one to where it does exist.

This question has been discussed in the physics literature (see, e.g., [\cite=St]) and it was proved by Th. and M. Hoffmann-Ostenhof and Simon [\cite=HOS] that for two-electron atoms in the spin singlet state the second scenario occurs, that is, there is a ground state at the critical coupling value. This corresponds to the case N = 2, but without the anti-symmetry assumption. On the other hand, Th. and M. Hoffmann-Ostenhof [\cite=HO] showed that in the triplet S-sector the first scenario occurs. This corresponds to the N = 2 case with anti-symmetry, but the admissible functions are further restricted to depend only on |x1|, |x2| and x1  ·  x2. Very recently Gridnev [\cite=G] has, among other things, generalized the Hoffmann-Ostenhof-Simon existence result to arbitrary N, but with the additional assumption that Zc lies in the interval (N - 2,N - 1). He has also conjectured that the assumption of a lower bound N - 2 on the critical Z is not necessary.

Our goal here in this paper is to reprove Gridnev's result by completely different means and to replace his assumption by a weaker one which we believe to be optimal. (In contrast to [\cite=G], however, we only consider an infinitely heavy nucleus.) Our method extends the one introduced in [\cite=FLS], where an alternative proof of the Hoffmann-Ostenhof-Simon existence result was given. In contrast to [\cite=HOS] no positivity of the ground state is needed and the proof in [\cite=FLS], as well as the proof in this paper, extend to the case where the particles move in an external magnetic field, for instance.

We proceed to formulate our results precisely. It is physically equivalent and mathematically convenient to rescale the xi in [\eqref=eq:hamintro] by U = 1 / Z. We then find that, apart from an overall factor of Z2, the Hamiltonian [\eqref=eq:hamintro] is unitarily equivalent to the Hamiltonian

[formula]

We consider H(N)U as a self-adjoint operator in the Hilbert space [formula] of anti-symmetric functions and denote its ground state energy by

[formula]

The ground state energy E(N)U of H(N)U is a non-decreasing, concave function of U and one has the ordering

[formula]

with respect to N. We define U(N)  =  {U > 0: E(N)U  <  E(N - 1)U}. The set of critical coupling constants is given by

[formula]

As mentioned before, by Zhislin's theorem E(N)U  <  E(N - 1)U for U < 1 / (N - 1) and, for instance by [\cite=Li], E(N)U  =  E(N - 1)U for all large U. Thus, U(N)c is non-empty. It is natural to believe that U(N) is a single interval and that U(N)c contains only one element, but we do not know how to prove this.

According to the HVZ theorem (see, e.g., [\cite=CyFrKiSi]) the strict inequality E(N)U  <  E(N - 1)U implies that E(N)U is an eigenvalue of H(N)U and, consequently, a ground state exists. On the other hand, it is clear that if [formula], then E(N)U is not an eigenvalue of H(N)U.

The following theorem is our main result. It gives a sufficient condition for E(N)Uc to be an eigenvalue of H(N)Uc for Uc∈U(N)c. The sufficient condition (for fixed Uc∈U(N)c) depends on an integer 1  ≤  K  ≤  N - 1, which is the largest integer such that E(N)Uc = E(N - K)Uc. Thus, we have

[formula]

where we interpret E(0)Uc = 0. Physically, K denotes the maximal number of electrons that can be removed from the system at U = Uc without changing the energy.

Our main result is as follows.

Let Uc∈U(N)c and assume that [formula], where K is the largest integer such that E(N)Uc = E(N - K)Uc. Then H(N)Uc has a ground state eigenfunction [formula].

The theorem is also valid if the anti-symmetry assumption is dropped or, which is the same, replaced by a symmetry assumption. The proof in this unconstrained case follows along the same line and is actually somewhat simpler, see Remark [\ref=symm]. The method also goes through essentially without modification in the case of spin.

In the case N = 2 and without the anti-symmetry assumption, the strict inequality Uc > 1 is a classical result of Bethe [\cite=Be]. Thus, (the symmetric version of) Theorem [\ref=binding] extends the results of [\cite=HOS] and [\cite=FLS].

In the case N = 2 and with the anti-symmetry assumption enforced, one has equality Uc = 1 and no ground state exists (at least no ground state depending only on |x1|, |x2| and x1  ·  x2) [\cite=HO]. This suggests that, in general, the assumption [formula] may not be dropped.

Our theorem generalizes Gridnev's result (in the case of infinite nuclear mass). Indeed, Gridnev's assumption [formula] implies, by Zhislin's theorem, that E(N - 1)Uc  <  E(N - 2)Uc and thus K = 1. Gridnev's second assumption [formula] coincides with our assumption. We emphasize that the main difficulty that we overcome in this paper is the case [formula] or, more generally, the case where K  ≥  2.

Strategy of the proof

A standard way to prove the existence of ground states at threshold is to prove that the weak limit of a ground state sequence ψUn when Un  →  Uc is not zero. Once one knows that the weak limit is non-zero it is easy to see that this weak limit has to be a ground state. In the spirit of [\cite=FLS] we give an upper bound on the 'radius' of ψUn which is independent on Un. Hereafter we denote |x|∞: =  max {|x1|,...,|xN|}. We interpret this as the maximal distance of the electrons from the nucleus.

For any δ,θ > 0 and any 1  ≤  K  ≤  N - 1 there are constants m,R > 0 such that for all U∈U(N) satisfying

[formula]

and for all normalized ground states ψU of H(N)U one has

[formula]

This theorem immediately implies Theorem [\ref=binding]. Indeed, let Uc∈U(N)c, let K be the largest integer such that E(N)Uc = E(N - K)Uc and assume that [formula]. Then there is a non-empty subset of U(N), containing Uc in its closure, with elements satisfying [\eqref=eq:mainass] for

[formula]

Then Theorem [\ref=main] implies that any sequence ψUn of normalized ground states of H(N)Un with Un from this subset and with Un  →  Uc satisfies [\eqref=eq:main]. Since ψUn is bounded in [formula] it has a weak limit in this space which, according to [\eqref=eq:main] is not identically zero. One easily verifies that the weak limit is a ground state of H(N)Uc, thus proving Theorem [\ref=binding]. This observation reduces the proof of Theorem [\ref=binding] to the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

Theorem [\ref=main], in turn, can be deduced from two lemmas that we state next. The first one, and this is the novelty of this paper, is an operator inequality for H(N)U. It estimates H(N)U - E(N)U from below by a potential well which is attractive of order l- 2 for |x|∞ < l, but has a repulsive Coulomb tail for |x|∞ > l. The parameter l can be chosen arbitrary large and the constants are uniform in U. The precise statement is

For any δ,θ > 0 and 1  ≤  K  ≤  N - 1 there are three constants c,C,l0 > 0 such that for all U∈U(N) satisfying [\eqref=eq:mainass] and all l  ≥  l0 one has

[formula]

The second ingredient in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] is the following elementary lemma, which we cite from [\cite=FLS].

Let [formula] be non-negative with [formula]. Assume that there are constants b > 0 and l0  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

for all l  ≥  l0. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

We now use Lemmas [\ref=opineq] and [\ref=calc] to give the

Fix δ,θ > 0 and 1  ≤  K  ≤  N - 1 and consider U's as in the statement of the theorem. Any normalized ground state ψU of H(N)U satisfies, according to the operator inequality [\ref=operineq],

[formula]

for all l  ≥  l0 and some constants c,C,l0 > 0. (Here we also used the fact that E(N - 1)U  ≥  E(N)U.) Lemma [\ref=calc] now implies that

[formula]

This proves [\eqref=eq:main].

To summarize the content of this section, we have reduced the proof of our main result to the proof of the operator inequality in Lemma [\ref=opineq]. This will be accomplished in Section [\ref=sec:opineq] after some preparations in Section [\ref=sec:ims].

A partition of unity

Our goal in this section is to construct a partition of unity in [formula] with an effective control on the Coulomb interaction between (subsets of) the 'particles' (electrons) [formula] and another 'particle' (nucleus) at the origin. Throughout this section we fix an integer N  ≥  2.

In order to formulate the properties of our partition of unity we need to introduce some notation. For every integer 1  ≤  k  ≤  N we denote by Jk the collection of all integer sequences [formula], where 1  ≤  Jl  ≤  N for all l and where all the Jl's are mutually distinct. For given J∈Jk and [formula] we denote by x̂J the vector in [formula] which coincides with x, but where the entries [formula] have been erased. Thus, if we denote as usual |x|∞: =  max {|x1|,...,|xN|}, then

[formula]

One can think of |x̂J|∞ as the maximum distance of the N - k electrons from the nucleus after having removed the k electrons with indices in J.

Finally, if π∈SN is a permutation and [formula], we set

[formula]

Here is the description of our partition of unity.

For any integer 1  ≤  K  ≤  N - 1 and any 0 < ε < 1 / 2 there is a constant cε > 0 with the following property. For any l > 0 there is a quadratic partition of unity,

[formula]

with

[formula]

and, for 1  ≤  j  ≤  N,

[formula]

and, for [formula],

[formula]

Moreover, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally, the Λ's behave as follows under permutations π∈SN.

[formula]

Here, for n = 1 we set [formula], that is, the condition [formula] for n = 1 means [formula].

Before proving this proposition we record some useful geometric facts.

Let 1  ≤  n  ≤  N - 1, [formula] and assume that [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

To prove the first claim it suffices to notice that

[formula]

To prove the second claim we shall show that [formula] implies [formula]. Thus, assume that for all [formula] one has [formula]. By the triangle inequality we get

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

as claimed.

The following result is a consequence of the construction of the partition of unity in Proposition [\ref=partition] and of Lemma [\ref=imp2]. It says that on the support of ΛJ with J∈JK + 1, all K + 1 particles [formula] are 'far out', that is, at a distance comparable to the distance of the particle that is farthest out. This will be useful in the proof of Lemma [\ref=opineq].

Let 1  ≤  k  ≤  N and [formula]. Assume that [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Then

[formula]

for every 1  ≤  n  ≤  k.

In particular, with the notation of Proposition [\ref=partition], let J∈JK + 1 and let [formula] such that ΛJ(x)  ≠  0. Then [\eqref=eq:farout] holds for every 1  ≤  n  ≤  K + 1.

By [\eqref=eq:lem2] the second assumption yields [formula] for all 1  ≤  n  ≤  k - 1. Combining this with the first assumption, we get

[formula]

Iterating this bound and recalling that [formula] we obtain claimed inequality.

If ΛJ(x)  ≠  0 for some J∈JK + 1, then the above assumptions are satisfied by the construction of ΛJ.

We now turn to the

We begin by constructing a finer partition of unity,

[formula]

The terms Λ0 and ΛJ with J∈JK + 1 are as in the statement of the proposition. For [formula] with 1  ≤  k  ≤  K, we will have

[formula]

We will also prove that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover, the refined partition of unity has the symmetry property

[formula]

for all J∈Jk, 1  ≤  k  ≤  K + 1, and Λ0(xπ) = Λ0(x).

We now explain how to obtain the asserted partition of unity from the refined one. We keep the terms Λ0 and ΛJ with J∈JK + 1. Moreover, for 1  ≤  j  ≤  N we define

[formula]

Thus, if Λj(x)  ≠  0, then there is a 1  ≤  k  ≤  K and a J∈Jk with Jk  =  j such that

[formula]

But this inequality implies that also

[formula]

which is the asserted condition for Λj. Moreover, by the Schwarz inequality,

[formula]

Therefore, the gradient bounds for the coarser partition of unity follow from those for the refined one.

The reason why we pass from the refined partition to the one stated in the proposition is that the latter satisfies the required symmetry assumptions. This is an immediate consequence of [\eqref=eq:symm].

Thus, it remains to construct the refined partition of unity. Let us start by introducing the following functions [formula],

[formula]

and the corresponding [formula] fulfilling f2(s) + 2(s) = g2(s) + 2(s) = 1 for all s  ≥  0. With this notation we define

[formula]

For [formula] with 1  ≤  k  ≤  K we set

[formula]

For [formula] we set

[formula]

It is straightforward but somewhat tedious to verify that this defines indeed a quadratic partition of unity. One way to verify this is to begin to sum ΛJ(x)2 over all J∈JK + 1 whose K first entries [formula] agree with some given element in JK. After having performed this sum, we sum ΛJ(x)2 over all J∈JK + 1 and all J∈JK whose K - 1 first entries [formula] agree with some given element in JK - 1. This sum can be simplified using g2  +  2 = 1. Proceeding in this way, we obtain the claimed partition of unity property.

The claimed support conditions and the symmetry condition [\eqref=eq:symm] follow immediately. We also observe that the terms in the denominators are positive, since for any [formula] and any [formula] there is a [formula] such that [formula] and therefore, since (1) = 1,

[formula]

Now we prove the gradient estimates [\eqref=eq:grad1] and [\eqref=eq:grad2]. The functions f, [formula], g, [formula] and |  ·  |∞ are Lipschitz, and therefore ΛJ is so as well and it suffices to prove the gradient bounds only in subsets where the numbers [formula] are pairwise distinct. Moreover, since all factors in the definition of ΛJ are bounded, it suffices to prove that each factor individually satisfies the claimed gradient bounds.

We begin with the term (|x|∞ / l). Differentiating we get This is obviously bounded by

[formula]

Moreover, since ' is supported in

[formula]

| ( () ) | ≤  .

[formula]

| ( () ) | ≤ ≤  .

[formula]

, it suffices to bound the gradient on the set where

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq:lem1] this bound entails |xm - xJn|  ≥  |xJn| / ((N - n)(1 - ε)) for all [formula], and therefore

[formula]

We can now argue as before and use Lemma [\ref=farout] to bound |xJn|- 1 from above in terms of |x|- 1∞. Then, again because of the factor (|x|∞ / l), we may replace |x|- 1∞ in the above bound by either 2l- 1 or (2 / l|x|∞)1 / 2. This yields the claimed bound. The proof for g instead of [formula] is similar and is omitted.

As already explained in the proof, the argument of passing from the refined partition of unity to the one stated in Proposition [\ref=partition] is needed to obtain the symmetry properties. Those are needed since in our main theorem [\ref=binding] we consider the operator H(N)U on anti-symmetric functions. If, instead, we had considered H(N)U without any symmetry restrictions, the refined partition would have been sufficient for the proof of our results.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=opineq]

With the help of the partition of unity that we constructed in the previous section we are now able to give the

Let 1  ≤  K  ≤  N - 1, let δ,θ > 0 and assume that U satisfies [\eqref=eq:mainass]. Our argument makes use of two additional parameters ε > 0 and l > 0 that we will specify later depending on δ and θ.

We use the partition of unity from Proposition [\ref=partition] (with the given parameters K, ε and l) and the IMS formula (see, e.g., [\cite=CyFrKiSi]) to localize the Hamiltonian. That is, we write for any wave function ψ

[formula]

where ψj  =  Λjψ and ψJ  =  ΛJψ. Here

[formula]

and similarly for eJ. Our goal is to show lower bounds on ej and eJ.

For e0, namely on the support of Λ0, we know from Proposition [\ref=partition] that the localization error is bounded by cε / l2. Moreover, since Λ0 is a symmetric function, ψ0 is anti-symmetric. Thus, bounding H(N)U from below by E(N)U we immediately arrive at

[formula]

Now let 1  ≤  j  ≤  N. On the support of Λj the localization error is bounded by cε / (l|x|∞). Moreover, we split

[formula]

where H(N - 1)U is obtained from H(N)U by dropping all terms involving the coordinate xj. By construction of Λj, ψj is an anti-symmetric function of the variables x̂j. Thus,

[formula]

If we now use the fact that ψj has support where Λj  ≠  0, we can further bound

[formula]

We now choose ε > 0 so small that

[formula]

Because of the first assumption on U in [\eqref=eq:mainass], this implies that

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

Finally, we bound eJ with [formula]. As before, on the support of ΛJ the localization error is bounded by cε / (l|x|∞). By construction of ΛJ, ψJ is an anti-symmetric function of the variables [formula]. By splitting off all the coordinates xJn with 1  ≤  n  ≤  K + 1 we obtain the lower bound

[formula]

On the support of ΛJ we can use Lemma [\ref=farout] to control the last sum and we obtain

[formula]

where [formula]. Notice that, since |x|∞  ≥  l / 2 on the support of ΛJ, we have there

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

At this point, we choose l0 > 0 such that

[formula]

Then, by the second assumption on U in [\eqref=eq:mainass],

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

for all l  ≥  l0.

To summarize, we have shown that for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  N and all J∈JK + 1 we have

[formula]

for all l  ≥  l0. Moreover, recall that

[formula]

Thus, using the fact that

[formula]

we obtain the claimed operator inequality [\eqref=operineq].
