A countable series of bisimple H-trivial finitely presented congruence-free monoids

It is well-known a countable series of infinite finitely presented simple groups by Graham Higman [\cite=Higman]. In view of that Boone-Higman Conjecture (see [\cite=LS] to learn about the results on finitely generated simple groups) is still an open problem, every example of finitely generated (and especially finitely presented) group and semigroup are very precious. Surprisingly, the semigroup analogue of simple groups - congruence-free semigroups - were studied not that extensively as that was for simple groups. The only results in this area are due to Jean-Camille Birget, we refer the reader to [\cite=Birget1]-[\cite=Birget5] to learn about semigroup analogues of Higman's groups.

The author of the current note asked himself - would it be possible to find the 'really' semigroup counterpart of Higman's series, i.e. so that each of the semigroups is finitely presented, congruence-free, bisimple, but yet H-trivial. Indeed such a series exists and the main goal of the note is to prove

Since Mn is given by a finite complete system, it is convenient to work with elements of Mn in their normal forms. So, a typical element of Mn looks like

[formula]

where ε  ≥  0, s  ≥  0, p  ≥  0, l  ≥  0; [formula]; [formula]; [formula].

Later we will need the following norm for the elements of Mn: if w∈Mn admits the normal form [\eqref=eq:form], then

Bisimplicity and H-triviality

It is straightforward from the presentation that alR1 for all l  ≥  0, and that ambR1 for all m  ≥  n + 1. Furthermore, bεL1 for all ε  ≥  0, and adbkL1 for all 1  ≤  d  ≤  n and k  ≥  1. Using these, by [\eqref=eq:form] we immediately see that every element of Mn is D-equivalent to 1 and so Mn is bisimple. One can quite easily assure oneself that Mn is, in addition, H-trivial.

Congruence-freeness

That Mn is congruence-free is equivalent to the following: for every congruence ρ on Mn, and u  ≠  v in Mn such that uρv, it follows that ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

We induct on [formula] to show that if u  ≠  v in Mn and ρ is a congruence on Mn with uρv, then ρ = Mn  ×  Mn. Prior to starting our induction we prove two facts we will use frequently within the induction arguments:

Any group homomorphic image of Mn is trivial.

Let G be the group presented by the initial presentation for Mn. Then an + 1b = 1 and so anb = 1 in G. This yields a = 1 and b = 1 in G.

Let ρ be a congruence on Mn such that adbR1 in Mn  /  ρ for some 1  ≤  d  ≤  n. Then ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

Since an + 1badb = 1, we have that adb∈H1 in Mn  /  ρ. Again by an + 1badb = 1, then an + 1b∈H1 and so an + 1 - d∈H1 (in Mn  /  ρ). This yields a∈H1 and thus b2∈H1 (in Mn  /  ρ). Therefore a,b∈H1 (in Mn  /  ρ) and thus Mn  /  ρ is a group. By Lemma [\ref=lm:first-lemma], ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

Base of induction: [formula]

Without loss we may assume that [formula] and v = 1. The possibilities for u are:

u = b. Then bρ1 and so an + 1ρ1 and an + 2ρ1. Thus aρ1 and so ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

u = a. Then aρ1 and so b2ρ1 and b2ρb. This implies bρ1 and thus ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

u = adb with 1  ≤  d  ≤  n. Then by Lemma [\ref=lm:second-lemma], ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

Induction step: [formula]

We may assume that u and v are in their normal forms. First let us sort out the case when one of u and v is the identity. Let, say, v = 1. If u starts with b, then b∈H1 in Mn  /  ρ. Then by an + 1b2 = b, a∈H1 in Mn  /  ρ. By Lemma [\ref=lm:first-lemma], then we have ρ = Mn  ×  Mn. If u starts with a, then three cases can happen:

[formula] for 1  ≤  d  ≤  n. Then adbR1 in Mn  /  ρ and so by Lemma [\ref=lm:second-lemma] ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

[formula] for m  ≥  n + 1. Then abρUambab = Uam - n - 1 and so aban + 1bρ1. Then abR1 in Mn  /  ρ and we are done.

[formula] for m  ≥  n + 1 and l  ≥  1. If l  ≥  n, then

[formula]

and running the arguments from the previous case, we derive that ρ = Mn  ×  Mn. If l  ≤  n - 1, then Uambρan + 1 - lbab. This yields an + 1 - lbabalρUambalρ1, and so an + 1 - lbR1 in Mn  /  ρ, thus ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

From now on, in the remainder of the induction step we may assume that u  ≠  1 and v  ≠  1. Now we sort out the case when at least one of u and v starts with b. Essentially there are only three following cases:

[formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] and so U  ≠  V (since U and V in their normal forms). But bL1 and so UρV. By induction, ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

[formula] and v = adbkV for 1  ≤  d  ≤  n, ε  ≥  1, k  ≥  1. Then bεU = an + 1b  ·  bεUρbk - 1V. Note that bεU and bk - 1V are in their normal forms. Thus if [formula], by induction it follows that ρ = Mn  ×  Mn. So, assume that [formula]. Then k  ≥  2 and so an + 1 - dbk - 1Vρan + 1b2  ·  bk - 2V = bk - 1V. Now by induction, ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

[formula] and [formula] for ε  ≥  1 and m  ≥  n + 1. Then bR1 in Mn  /  ρ, and so b∈H1 in Mn  /  ρ. By an + 1b2 = b, this gives a∈H1 in Mn  /  ρ and so by Lemma [\ref=lm:first-lemma], ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

We are left with the situation when both u and v start with a. First we deal with the case when one of u and v starts with a prefix of the form adb for some 1  ≤  d  ≤  n. Up to changing the roles of u and v, this splits into the following two cases:

[formula] and [formula] for 1  ≤  d,d + r  ≤  n, and d,r,k,t  ≥  1, and such that U is either empty or starts with a. Premultiplying uρv with an + 1ban - d - r, we obtain bk - 1Uρbt - 1V. Both bk - 1U and bt - 1V are in their normal forms. If [formula], then by induction we are done. So, assume that [formula]. Then ad + rbkUρadbkU. If k > 1, then by premultiplying the last ρ-equivalence with an + 1 - d - r, we obtain bk - 1Uρan + 1 - rbkU and can apply induction. So assume that k = 1. Then an + 1bUρan + 1 - rbU and so in general an + 1 + prbUρan + 1 - rbU for all p  ≥  0. For a sufficiently large p, an + 1 + prbUR1 and so an + 1 - rbR1 in Mn  /  ρ. By Lemma [\ref=lm:second-lemma], then ρ = Mn  ×  Mn.

[formula] and [formula] for 1  ≤  d  ≤  n, k  ≥  1, m  ≥  n + 1; and such that U is either empty or starts with a. If k  ≥  2, then bk - 1Uρan + 1 - d + mbV and so bR1 in Mn  /  ρ. Then, as above, aρbρ1 and so ρ = Mn  ×  Mn. If k = 1, then adbUρambV and so Uρan + 1bambV. Hence adban + 1bambVρambV and so adban + 1bρ1. Therefore adbR1 in Mn  /  ρ and by Lemma [\ref=lm:second-lemma] we are done.

In the remainder of the induction step, both u and v will start with prefixes of the form amb for m  ≥  n + 1. If both u and v end with a, we can cancel this distinguished a (since aR1) and then apply induction. So without loss we will assume that [formula] (with m  ≥  n + 1). We have two cases to consider depending on whether v ends with a or not:

[formula] with p  ≥  n + 1. Then postmultiplying UambρVapb with ab, we obtain Uam - n - 1ρVap - n - 1 and may apply induction.

[formula] with l  ≥  1. Then UambρVal and so, by postmultiplying with anb, Uam - n - 1ρVal + nb. If [formula], then we may apply induction. So assume that [formula]. Then m = n + 1 and uρv reads as

[formula]

If l  ≥  n + 1, then ValbρVal + nb2 = Val - 1b, and since Valb is in its normal form (and regardless whether Val - 1b must be reduced to get its normal form), we may apply induction. So we will assume that l  ≤  n. If 2  ≤  l  ≤  n, then postmultiply [\eqref=eq:something] with an + 1 - l to obtain Van + 1bρVal + nb and then use induction. Hence let l = 1, then posmultiply [\eqref=eq:something] with b: VabρVan + 1b2 = Vb. If [formula], then abρb and so b2ρ1 and aρab2ρb2ρ1. This yields that Mn  /  ρ is a group and so we are done. Thus we may assume that V is non-empty: [formula] (with t  ≥  n + 1). Then If t - n - 1  ≥  n + 1, then we may apply induction. So let t - n - 1  ≤  n. If [formula], then anρanb and so 1ρan + 1ban. This implies a∈H1 in Mn  /  ρ, which in turn gives b∈H1 in Mn  /  ρ. These imply ρ = Mn  ×  Mn. Thus we may assume that V' is non-empty: V' = V''aqb (with q  ≥  n + 1). Then V''aq - n - 1ρV''aqbat - n - 1. If t - n - 1 = 0 we may apply induction. So assume that 1  ≤  t - n - 1  ≤  n and then by postmultiplying with b the last ρ-equivalence, we obtain V''aq - n - 1bρV''aq - n - 1. Proceeding further in this manner we eventually will arrive at two distinct ρ-equivalent words in their normal forms and then apply induction.

The proof is complete.
