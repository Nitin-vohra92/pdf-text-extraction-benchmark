Introduction

Throughout the paper, we consider only the simple graph. Let V(G) and E(G) denote the vertex set and edge set of the graph G. As usual we will use the symbol

[formula]

n(K,d)≤ 2d k+2d-1 i-1.

[formula]

. Construct the biclique cover [formula] which Hi has (Xi,Yi) as vertex classes such that Xi is the set of all subsets that contain i and Yi is the set of all subsets that do not contain i. These results are far from being optimal, but the above construction motivated us to define the following definition. We will denote by nr(K,d) the maximum possible cardinality of the vertices of a complete graph such that there exists a regular biclique cover of type K and size d. We prove the following upper bound of nr(K,d).

If K is a set of k positive integers, then

[formula]

It is interesting to consider the biclique cover of type K of other graphs besides the complete graph. Assume that K is a set of k positive integers and X is an arbitrary set of d points. Suppose that [formula] and [formula] are two collections of subsets of X such that [formula] for i  ≠  j and [formula] for every i. The pair (A,B) is called a cross K-intersection families. The following theorem shows that a cross K-intersection family can be formulated in terms of biclique cover of type K of the graph K-m,m.

Let [formula], there exists a cross K-intersection families with m blocks on a set of d points if and only if there exists a biclique cover of type K and size d of K-m,m.

In [\cite=snevily] Snevily made the following conjecture. By Theorem [\ref=cross], we can state the above conjecture in terms of the biclique cover as follows. The maximum number of the vertices in each part of a complete bipartite graph with a perfect matching removed that admits a biclique cover of size d is at most [formula]. Note that this bound is sharp by taking all k-element subsets of

[formula]

as B. In [\cite=Chen] William Y.C. Chen and Jiuqiang Liu proved the following theorem. Clearly, for a prime number p greater than d, and r = 1 the above theorem is true and the following corollary is straightforward.

Let [formula] be a set of k positive integers and max  lj  <  s. Suppose that [formula] and [formula] are two collections of subsets of

[formula]

m ≤.

[formula]

This corollary shows that if we have a biclique cover of type [formula] of a complete bipartite graph with a perfect matching removed such that every vertex of this graph lies in exactly s bicliques and max  lj  <  s. Then the maximum possible cardinality of the vertices of this graph is at most [formula]. The structure of the rest of this paper is to prove Theorem [\ref=koli], [\ref=regular], and [\ref=cross]. The proofs based on the concept of applying linear algebra method that is used in [\cite=alon2] [\cite=Chen] [\cite=Liu] [\cite=snevily].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=koli]

A polynomial in n variable is called multilinear if every variable has degree 0 or 1. Observe that when each variable in a polynomial attains values 0 or 1, if each variable xpi (p > 1) is replaced by xi, we can consider this polynomial as a multilinear polynomial. For a subset Ai of

[formula]

A:={ j  |  i ∈ X }     &     B:={ j  |  i ∈ Y }.

[formula]

P(x,y)= (v.x + v.y-l).

[formula]

A={(M,N)  |  M,N ⊆,   M N= ,    d∈ N,    |M N |≤ k }.

[formula]

Q(x,y)=x y.

[formula]

P={ P(x,y)  |  1≤ i≤ n} { Q(x,y)  |  (M,N) ∈ }

[formula]

α P(x,y) + β Q(x,y)=0.

[formula]

n+ 2d-1 i≤ 2d i.

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=regular]

Before embarking on the proof of Theorem [\ref=regular], we will establish the following lemma.

For every 1  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1, let the set Bi define as follows:

[formula]

Let for every pair (I,J)∈Bi ,Ri(I,J)(x,y) denote the following polynomial

[formula]

Then

[formula]

is a set of linearly independent polynomials.

Obviously, for every 1  ≤  i  <  d we have

[formula]

It is a well-known fact that

[formula]

By this fact clearly, [formula]. Let [formula] and B is defined as Lemma [\ref=poly]. We claim that [formula] with all the polynomials Ri(I,J)(x,y)∈B remain linearly independent. Before prove the claim, we shall note that all polynomials in the set B have this property that vanish in the point (vBi,vAi) for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Now, assume the claim is false and let

[formula]

be a nontrivial linear relation.

Step 1.  Let i0 be a subscript such that [formula] and αi0  ≠  0. Substitute (vBi0,vAi0) for (x,y) in the linear relation [\ref=se]. We know that for every i and every (I,J)∈Bi, Ri(I,J)(vBi0,vAi0) = 0. Also, d∈N so Q(M,N)(vBi0,vAi0) = 0. Using these and by [\ref=sefr] all terms in the linear relation [\ref=se] but αi0Pi0(vBi0,vAi0) vanish. Since Pi0(vBi0,vAi0)  ≠  0, therefore αi0 = 0.

Step 2.  According to the step 1 we have

[formula]

Let i0 be a subscript such that αi0  ≠  0. We define v'Ai0 to be [formula]. Substitute (vBi0,v'Ai0) for (x,y) in the linear relation [\ref=chahar]. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1 and every pair (I,J)∈Bi, by the definition of Ri(I,J)(x,y), it holds that Ri(I,J)(vBj,vAj) = Ri(I,J)(vBj,v'Aj) for every 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. Now, similar in the step 1 all terms in the relation [\ref=chahar] but αi0Pi0(vBi0,v'Ai0) vanish. Since Pi0(vBi0,v'Ai0)  ≠  0, therefore αi0 = 0. So, we have

[formula]

Step 3.  Since d∈N and [formula] for all (I,J)∈Bi, [formula], if we evaluate equality [\ref=panj] in (vI,vJ) then we conclude that γ(I,J) = 0. Hence we have

[formula]

Assume that (I0,J0) is a subscript such that has minimum cardinality in the set A1 such that γ(I0,J0)  ≠  0. Substituting (vI0,vJ0) in the equation [\ref=shish] then since [formula] and [formula] all terms in [\ref=shish] but γ(I0,J0)R1(I0,J0)(vI0,vJ0) vanish. So we have γ(I0,J0) = 0 Step 4.  By independence of the polynomials in the set P, each β(M,N) = 0, therefore the claim is true.

So, we have [formula] linearly independent polynomials which, as the proof of Theorem [\ref=koli], are in the space generated by [formula] monomials. Hence,

[formula]

That complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=regular].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=cross]

Let [formula], and (A,B) be a cross K-intersection families with m blocks on a set of d points. For every 1  ≤  j  ≤  d, let

[formula]

[formula]

Now, for [formula], we construct the complete bipartite graph Gj with vertex set (Xj,Yj), where Xj and Yj were defined as above. Let ij be an arbitrary edge of K-m,m, consider sets Ai and Bj. Without loss of generality assume that [formula], which 1  ≤  l  ≤  k. It is not difficult to see that the edge ij was covered by the graphs [formula]. So we have a biclique cover of type K and size d of K-m,m. Conversely let [formula] be a biclique cover of type K and size d of the graph K-m,m. Assume Gi has (Xi,Yi) as the vertex set. For every 1  ≤  j  ≤  m define

[formula]

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula] for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  d then [formula] for every 1  ≤  j  ≤  m. Also, if [formula] is the set of graphs that cover the edge ij then [formula] where [formula]. Hence (A,B) is a cross K-intersection family.
