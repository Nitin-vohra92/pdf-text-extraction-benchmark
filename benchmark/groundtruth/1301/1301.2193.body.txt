Regularity and fast escaping points of entire functions

Introduction

Let [formula] be a transcendental entire function and denote by [formula], the nth iterate of f. The Fatou set F(f) is the set of points [formula] such that [formula] forms a normal family in some neighborhood of z. The complement of F(f) is called the Julia set J(f) of f. An introduction to the properties of these sets can be found in [\cite=wB93].

In recent years there has been much interest in understanding the structure of the escaping set  I(f) of f, defined as follows:

[formula]

The first general results about I(f) were obtained by Eremenko in [\cite=E], who showed that [formula] and J(f) = ∂I(f), and also that all the components of [formula] are unbounded. Much of this work has been directed towards solving what is known as Eremenko's conjecture, which states that all the components of I(f) itself are unbounded. Though this conjecture is still unsolved, much progress has been made in special cases (see [\cite=RRRS] for example), and in the general case it is known [\cite=RS05] that I(f) has at least one unbounded component.

This result in the general case was proved by using the fast escaping set  A(f), which consists of points whose iterates tend to ∞   as fast as possible. The set A(f) was introduced in [\cite=BH99] and can be defined as follows; see [\cite=RS09a]. Let

[formula]

and put

[formula]

where Mn(r) denotes iteration of M(r), and R > 0 is any value such that M(r) > r for r  ≥  R. The set A(f) has many strong properties that can be used in the study of I(f) and J(f); see [\cite=RS09a]. For example, all the components of A(f) are unbounded.

In [\cite=RS09a] we gave a weaker condition on the iterates of a point that is sufficient to ensure that the point is in A(f). To be precise we showed that if μ(r)  =  εM(r), r > 0, where ε∈(0,1), then

[formula]

where R > 0 is sufficiently large to ensure that μ(r)  >  r, for r  ≥  R.

Sixsmith [\cite=dS12] recently gave a weaker but somewhat more involved condition than the one in [\eqref=fast-weak] which ensures that points are in A(f).

A further weakening of [\eqref=fast-weak] is to replace εM(r) by M(r)ε. In other words, for 0 < ε < 1, we let

[formula]

and consider the set

[formula]

where R > 0 has the property that με(r) > r for r  ≥  R. It is easy to check that the definition of Qε(f) is independent of the choice of R with the property that με(r) > r for r  ≥  R.

Points that lie in Qε(f) for some ε, 0 < ε < 1, have played a significant role in recent work related to both Eremenko's conjecture and a conjecture of Baker that all transcendental entire functions of sufficiently small order have no unbounded Fatou components (see [\cite=RS11b]), and also in papers related to the Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff dimension of various Julia and escaping sets (see the remark following Theorem [\ref=classB-thm]). Because of the increased significance of these points we define the set

[formula]

to be the quite fast escaping set of f. It follows immediately from these definitions that

[formula]

The central question in this paper concerns the relationship between Q(f) and A(f), and we show that for many transcendental entire functions Q(f) is identical to A(f). However, we also give examples of entire functions for which Q(f)  ≠  A(f); further such examples, which are related to Eremenko's conjecture and Baker's conjecture and are much more complicated, are given in [\cite=RS11].

An important special case of our results is the following theorem concerning the much-studied Eremenko-Lyubich class B, which consists of transcendental entire functions whose set of singular values (that is, critical values and asymptotic values) is bounded.

Let f be a transcendental entire function in the class B. Then Q(f) = A(f).

Remark. Theorem [\ref=classB-thm] implies that some results concerning the Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff dimension of the escaping sets and Julia sets of certain functions in the class B also hold for the fast escaping sets of such functions. In particular, [\cite=BKS] and [\cite=jP11] were proved by considering points in Q(f) (although this is not stated explicitly) and so, since the functions in those results are in the class B, it follows from Theorem [\ref=classB-thm] that the conclusions of those results also hold for A(f).

The proof of Theorem [\ref=classB-thm] is in two steps. First we introduce a regularity condition on f which implies that Q(f) = A(f). Let R > 0 be any value such that M(r) > r for r  ≥  R. We say that f is

ε-regular, where 0 < ε < 1, if there exists r = r(R) > 0 such that

[formula]

or, equivalently, if there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

weakly regular if f is ε-regular for all 0 < ε < 1.

We note that the definition of ε-regularity is independent of the value of R with the property that M(r) > r for r  ≥  R.

Roughly speaking, the aim of these regularity conditions, and other related conditions to be introduced later in the paper, is to prevent the maximum modulus of a transcendental entire function from behaving on long intervals in a way that is too similar to that of a polynomial.

We show that, not only is weak regularity a sufficient condition for Q(f) = A(f), but it is also a necessary condition for Q(f) = A(f).

Let f be a transcendental entire function and 0 < ε < 1. Then

f is ε-regular if and only if  Qε(f) = A(f);

f is weakly regular if and only if  Q(f) = A(f).

The proof that weak regularity is a sufficient condition for Q(f)  =  A(f) is straightforward. However, in order to prove that it is also a necessary condition we require a rather general result from [\cite=RS13a] that guarantees the existence of points with a prescribed rate of escape; see Section [\ref=mainthm].

The second (and main) step in the proof of Theorem [\ref=classB-thm] is to show that if f is in the class B, then f is weakly regular. Recall that if f is in the class B, then f is bounded on some path to ∞  ; see [\cite=EL92]. Our next result shows that f is weakly regular whenever f is bounded on a path to ∞   and indeed under a much weaker hypothesis involving the minimum modulus of f, which is defined as follows:

[formula]

Thus Theorem [\ref=classB-thm] can be viewed as a special case of the following result.

Let f be a transcendental entire function such that, for some r(f) > 1,

[formula]

where K = 4 log 4. Then f is weakly regular, and hence Q(f) = A(f).

In fact we show that [\eqref=minmod1] implies that f satisfies a stronger regularity condition called 'log-regularity' that we define in Section [\ref=regprops]. This log-regularity condition was introduced by Anderson and Hinkkanen in [\cite=AH99] in connection with Baker's conjecture, and it is easier to check than weak regularity. We prove Theorem [\ref=main1a] by using a comparatively unknown result of Beurling from his thesis [\cite=aB33], which relates the size of the minimum modulus of a function to the growth of its maximum modulus.

The structure of the paper is as follows. We begin in Section [\ref=basics] by discussing some of the basic properties of Q(f). In Section [\ref=mainthm] we prove Theorem [\ref=main2a] and also construct functions for which Q(f)  ≠  A(f).

In Section [\ref=regprops], we discuss several regularity conditions for a transcendental entire function and the relationships between them; in particular, we show that log-regularity implies weak regularity and that ε-regularity is equivalent to a type of regularity introduced in [\cite=RS09a]. Then in Section [\ref=logreg] we prove Theorem [\ref=main1a]. Finally, in Section [\ref=example] we construct examples in order to show that ε-regularity, weak-regularity and log-regularity are not equivalent conditions.

Basic properties of Q(f)

In this section we show that Q(f) has many of the same basic properties as I(f) and A(f). As mentioned earlier, Eremenko [\cite=E] established the following properties of I(f):

[formula]

and he also showed that [formula] has no bounded components. The fast escaping set also has the properties listed in [\eqref=Iprops], and in addition A(f) itself has no bounded components, as noted earlier; see [\cite=BH99] and [\cite=RS05].

The sets Q(f) and Qε(f) have similar properties to I(f). The proofs of these properties are similar to those for I(f) so we give only brief details for Q(f).

Let f be a transcendental entire function. Then

[formula]

and [formula] has no bounded components. Similar properties hold for each set Qε(f), where 0 < ε < 1.

The first three properties in [\eqref=Qprops1] are immediate since these properties hold for A(f) (see [\cite=RS09a]) and A(f)  ⊂  Q(f).

Because Q(f) is infinite and completely invariant under f, we have [formula], and this implies that J(f)  ⊂  ∂Q(f) since any open subset of Q(f) is contained in F(f). Also, no point of ∂Q(f) lies in F(f) since any such point would have a neighbourhood in Q(f) by an application of the distortion theorem for iterates in Fatou components; see [\cite=wB93]. Hence J(f) = ∂Q(f).

Finally, if [formula] has a bounded component, E say, then there is an open topological annulus A lying in the complement of [formula] that surrounds E. Since [formula] is completely invariant under f, we deduce by Montel's theorem that A  ⊂  F(f) and since J(f) = ∂Q(f) we deduce that A is contained in a multiply connected Fatou component. But any multiply connected Fatou component of f is contained in A(f) (see [\cite=RS05] or [\cite=RS09a]) and hence in Q(f), so we obtain a contradiction. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=Qprops].

Remark  In view of the considerable interest in Eremenko's conjecture, it is natural to ask whether all the components of Q(f) are unbounded.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main2a]

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=main2a] and also construct examples for which Q(f)  ≠  A(f). The proof of Theorem [\ref=main2a] uses the following general result from [\cite=RS13a].

Let f be a transcendental entire function. There exists R = R(f) > 0 with the property that whenever (an) is a positive sequence such that

[formula]

there exists a point ζ∈J(f) and a sequence (nj) with nj  →    ∞   as j  →    ∞  , such that

[formula]

This result guarantees in particular that for any given rate of escape that is at most that of 'fast escape' there exist points that escape at least at this given rate and in some sense at no faster rate.

We first prove part (a), which states that f is ε-regular if and only if Qε(f) = A(f). Let 0 < ε < 1 and let R > 0 be so large that με(r) > r for r  ≥  R and so that Theorem [\ref=rate] can be applied with this value of R.

Suppose first that f is ε-regular. If z∈Qε(f), then there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Let r = r(R) be as in the definition of ε-regularity. Then there exists m∈N such that μmε(R) > r so

[formula]

and hence z∈A(f). Thus Qε(f) = A(f).

The proof of part (a) in the opposite direction uses Theorem [\ref=rate]. The idea is to show that if the function f is not ε-regular, where 0 < ε < 1, then the set [formula] is non-empty.

If f is not ε-regular, then for each [formula] there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Next, by Theorem [\ref=rate], with an  =  μnε(R), [formula], there exists a point ζ and a sequence (nj) with nj  →    ∞   as j  →    ∞  , such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=QnotA1] that ζ∈Qε(f). Also, [\eqref=QnotA2] and [\eqref=not-weak-reg] together imply that, for each [formula], we have

[formula]

for sufficiently large values of j. Hence ζ∉A(f), so [formula], as required.

Part (b) of Theorem [\ref=main2a] follows easily from part (a). If f is weakly regular, then f is ε-regular for all 0 < ε < 1, so Qε(f) = A(f) for all 0 < ε < 1, by part (a), and hence Q(f) = A(f). In the other direction, if Q(f) = A(f), then Qε(f) = A(f) for all 0 < ε < 1, by [\eqref=AQI], so f is ε-regular for all 0 < ε < 1, by part (a), and hence f is weakly regular.

Next we show that there exist transcendental entire functions f such that Q(f)  ≠  A(f).

Let 0 < ε < 1. There exists a transcendental entire function f such that Qε(f)  ≠  A(f), and hence Q(f)  ≠  A(f).

We use the following lemma.

Let

[formula]

Then there exist δ∈(0,1) and a sequence (cm), with cm  →  0 as m  →    ∞   and 0 < cm < 1 for [formula], such that, if rm + 1  >  4rm for [formula], then

[formula]

This follows easily by writing

[formula]

We now indicate how Lemma [\ref=exlem] can be used to show that, if 0 < ε < 1 and rm + 1 / rm is sufficiently large for each [formula], then the function f given by [\eqref=prod] is not ε-regular and hence Qε(f)  ≠  A(f).

Let ε'∈(ε,1). It follows from [\eqref=poly] that, for each [formula], if rm + 1 / rm is sufficiently large, then there exists Rm  >  rm such that

[formula]

Now fix [formula] and set Mm(r)  =  rε'm and με,m(r)  =  rεm. Since ε  <  ε', there exists [formula] such that (εm)Nm + m  <  (ε'm)Nm and hence, for r > 0,

[formula]

So, if we choose rm + 1 sufficiently large to ensure that [formula], then it follows from [\eqref=Mnu] and [\eqref=Nn], with r = Rm, that

[formula]

Now let R be so large that M(r) > r, for r  ≥  R and let [formula] be such that Rm  >  M(R)  >  με(R). Then there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=Nm] and [\eqref=long] that

[formula]

and so, if n is sufficiently large,

[formula]

Hence f is not ε-regular, as required.

Remark  In Section [\ref=example] we show by a different method that if 0 < ε  <  ε' < 1, then there exists a function that is ε'-regular but not ε-regular, thus giving an alternative construction of a function for which Q(f)  ≠  A(f).

Regularity conditions

Theorem [\ref=main2a] tells us that weak-regularity implies that Q(f) = A(f). Unfortunately, weak-regularity is not straightforward to check directly. In this section we discuss several other regularity conditions and the relationships between these conditions and weak regularity. In particular, we discuss log-regularity which implies weak regularity and is often easy to check.

We say that a transcendental entire function f is log-regular if there exists c > 0 such that the function φ(t)  =   log M(et) satisfies

[formula]

As mentioned earlier, the log-regularity condition was introduced by Anderson and Hinkkanen in [\cite=AH99] in relation to Baker's conjecture. The name log-regular was suggested by Aimo Hinkkanen in a private communication and used first by Sixsmith [\cite=dS11]. It was pointed out in [\cite=H] that this condition holds for all transcendental entire functions of finite order and positive lower order; recall that the order ρ and the lower order λ of a transcendental entire function f are:

[formula]

The paper  [\cite=dS11] gives many other classes of entire functions that are log-regular; for example, any composition of transcendental entire functions is log-regular if one of the functions in the composition is log-regular and any transcendental entire function f is log-regular if and only if its derivative is log-regular.

There are also many transcendental entire functions which are not log-regular. For example, if f has a multiply connected Fatou component, then f is not log-regular. This follows from the fact that such Fatou components contain large annuli within which the iterates of f behave like the iterated maximum modulus of f (see, for example, [\cite=BRS11]); combined with log-regularity this fact would contradict the distortion theorem for iterates in a Fatou component [\cite=wB93].

We now show that log-regularity implies weak-regularity. This result can also be deduced by combining results given in [\cite=RS08] and [\cite=RS09a] (see Theorem [\ref=condns] part (d)) but we include a direct proof here for completeness.

Let f be a transcendental entire function. If f is log-regular, then f is weakly regular.

Remark  In Section [\ref=example] we give an example of an entire function which is weakly regular but not log-regular.

To prove Theorem [\ref=main2], we first give a result on convex functions that leads to an alternative characterisation of log-regularity. This alternative characterisation is used again in Sections [\ref=logreg] and [\ref=example] of this paper to determine whether certain functions are or are not log-regular, and also in [\cite=dS11].

Let φ be an increasing convex function defined on [formula]. The following are equivalent:

there exist t0 > 0 and c > 0 such that

[formula]

there exist t0 > 0 and c > 0 such that for all k > 1 and d = kc, we have

[formula]

there exist t1 > 0, k > 1 and d > 1, such that

[formula]

Remark   For definiteness, in the statement of this theorem φ'(t) denotes the right derivative of φ at t.

To obtain our alternative characterisation of log-regularity we apply Theorem [\ref=log-reg-phi] with φ(t) =  log M(et).

Let f be a transcendental entire function. The following are equivalent:

f is log-regular;

there exist r0 > 0 and c > 0 such that for all k > 1 and d = kc, we have

[formula]

there exist r1 > 0, k > 1 and d > 1, such that

[formula]

Remarks  1. Corollary [\ref=log-reg] part (b) shows that log-regularity represents a strengthening of the following version of Hadamard convexity, given in [\cite=RS08]: for every transcendental entire function f there exists r(f) > 0 such that, for all r  ≥  r(f) and all k > 1,

[formula]

2. The condition in Corollary [\ref=log-reg] part (c) is equivalent to a regularity condition used by Wang in [\cite=W], namely, that there exists k > 1 such that

[formula]

Thus the latter condition is equivalent to log-regularity.

To prove that (a) implies (b), we note that, for t  ≥  t0,

[formula]

Next, it is clear that (b) implies (c).

To prove that (c) implies (a), suppose that t  ≥  kt1. Since φ' is increasing,

[formula]

so, using the fact that φ(t)  ≥  kdφ(t / k), we have

[formula]

where c > 0, as required.

Now we deduce Theorem [\ref=main2].

Suppose that f is log-regular with constant c > 0 and let ε be given with 0 < ε < 1.

Let R be so large that M(r) > r, for r  ≥  R. By Corollary [\ref=log-reg] part (b), there exists r0  ≥  R such that for all k > 1 and d = kc, we have

[formula]

We apply this estimate with d = 1 / ε > 1 and k = d1 / c > 1. Then

[formula]

Thus, by induction,

[formula]

Hence f is ε-regular.

We point out that there are other types of regularity conditions that are closely related to log-regularity and weak-regularity. These were introduced in [\cite=RS08] and [\cite=RS09a] in relation to Baker's conjecture and the existence of a spider's web structure for the fast escaping set. We summarize the relationships between these conditions in the following theorem which shows that there are many examples of transcendental entire functions that are weakly regular.

Let f be a transcendental entire function and let R > 0 be such that M(r) > r, for r  ≥  R. Then

f is ε-regular, where 0 < ε < 1, if and only if there is a sequence (rn) such that

[formula]

where m = 1 / ε;

if m > 1 and there exists a real function ψ defined on

[formula]

, n  ≥  0.

Next, for 0 < s < 1, we let Ψs(t) = sΦ(t), [formula], and we estimate the size of Ψs(t) for t∈[tn,tn  +  1]. A general point t∈[tn,tn  +  1] is of the form

[formula]

and, by [\eqref=phi-def],

[formula]

By [\eqref=general-t],

[formula]

and hence, by [\eqref=nu-t] and [\eqref=phi-def],

[formula]

Hence, for all t∈[tn,tn  +  1] and s∈(0,1), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

To prove part (a) it is sufficient to prove that f is b-regular. Put [formula], so c < β < b. Then, by [\eqref=lower] with s = β and t∈[tn,tn  +  1], we have

[formula]

provided that

[formula]

Thus if N is so large that

[formula]

and t∈[(4(1  -  c)  /  (b  -  c))tN,tN  +  1], then, by repeated application of [\eqref=lower-1], we obtain

[formula]

In particular, if t∈[(4(1  -  c)  /  (b  -  c))tN,tN  +  1], then

[formula]

Since 0 < β / b < 1, we can apply Lemma [\ref=clunie-kovari] to obtain a transcendental entire function f and [formula] such that

[formula]

and also such that [\eqref=N1] holds, and hence [\eqref=nu-n].

For 0 < ε < 1, we put

[formula]

Then, by [\eqref=f-cond],

[formula]

Therefore, if t∈[(4(1  -  d)  /  (b  -  d))tN,tN  +  1], then, by [\eqref=nu-n] and [\eqref=f-cond] again,

[formula]

so

[formula]

Hence f is b-regular.

To prove part (b) it is sufficient to show that f is not a-regular. Put [formula], so a < α < c. Then, by [\eqref=upper] with s = α and t∈[tn,tn  +  1], we have

[formula]

We deduce, by [\eqref=f-cond], [\eqref=mu-def] and [\eqref=upper1], that if t∈[tn,tn  +  1], then

[formula]

Since 0 < a / c < 1, we deduce that for any [formula] and t∈(tn,tn + 1] there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

By applying this result repeatedly we see that for any [formula], t∈[tn,tn  +  1] and [formula] there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Now let

[formula]

Then, by [\eqref=f-cond], we have

[formula]

Thus if we put

[formula]

then Φn(tN)  ≥  Tn  ≥  Ψnβ(tN), for n  ≥  0, so it follows by [\eqref=nu-n] that

[formula]

Thus, for any n  ≥  N and t∈[tn,tn  +  1] we can take [formula] in [\eqref=drop] and deduce that there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

by [\eqref=nodrop]. Hence, for any sufficiently large t, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

by [\eqref=Phi-def] and [\eqref=Tn-def], and it follows that f is not a-regular.
