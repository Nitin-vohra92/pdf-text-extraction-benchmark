n-Weak Module Amenability of Triangular Banach Algebras

Introduction

The concept of module amenability for Banach algebras was initiated by Amini in [\cite=am1]. The fundamental result was that the semigroup algebra [formula] is module amenable as a Banach module on [formula] if and only if S is amenable, where S is an inverse semigroup with subsemigroup E of idempotents. In fact he showed that Johnson's theorem [\cite=joh] (for groups) holds for discrete inverse semigroups if the relevant module structure is taken into account. Amini and Bagha in [\cite=am3] introduced the concept of weak amenability for Banach algebras showed that [formula] is weakly [formula]-module amenable when S is a commutative inverse semigroup with the set of idempotents E (indeed this is true for inverse semigroups whose idempotents are central). Bodaghi et al. in [\cite=bod] and [\cite=bab] extended this result and showed that [formula] is n-weakly module amenable as an [formula]-module (with trivial left action) when n is odd.

Pourabbas and Nasrabadi investigated weak module amenability of a class of Banach algebras, called triangular Banach algebras in [\cite=po]. They considered the case where A, B are unital Banach algebras (with [formula]-module structure) and M is a unital Banach A,B-module and showed that the corresponding triangular Banach algebra [formula] is weakly module amenable (as an [formula]-module) if and only if both A and B are weakly module amenable (as [formula]-modules). This can be regarded as the module version of a result of Forrest and Marcoux [\cite=fo1] (the case that A or B has a bounded approximate identity and M is essential was later proved by Medghalchi et al. in [\cite=me]). Also, they generalized this result to the case of (2n - 1)-weak module amenability for n  ≥  1 in [\cite=fo1].

The concept of Arens module regularity is introduced in [\cite=re] and modified in [\cite=pou]. It is shown that [formula] is module Arens regular (as an [formula]-module) if and only if the group homomorphic image GS of S is finite (see also [\cite=pou2]).

The motivation of writing this paper is Example [\ref=123] which shows that for the commutative inverse semigroup S with subsemigroup E of idempotents, the Banach algebra [formula] is n-weakly module amenable (as an [formula]-module) when [formula].

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is devoted to the study of module amenability of triangular Banach algebras. The main result of section 3 asserts that module Arens regularity of [formula] is equivalent to that A and B are both module Arens regular and both act module regularly on M. In section 4, we generalize some results of [\cite=fo1] and [\cite=me], and we show that the triangular Banach algebra T is (2n - 1)-weakly module amenable (as an [formula]-bimodule) if and only if A and B are (2n - 1)-weakly module amenable (as Banach [formula]-bimodules). In section 5, we prove that if A and B are (2n)-weakly module amenable, then the first module cohomology group of T with coefficients in T(2n) is a quotient of a special set of module homomorphism from M to M(2n). In section 6, we show that for a commutative inverse semigroup S with the set of idempotents E, the semigroup algebra [formula] is n-weakly module amenable as an [formula]-module for all [formula]. As a corollary, we show that [formula] is permanently weakly module amenable (as an [formula]-module). Finally, we show thatT0 is module Arens regular if and only if GS = S /   ≈   is finite, where s  ≈  t whenever δs  -  δt belongs to the closed linear span of the set {δset  -  δst:s,t∈S,e∈E}.

Module amenability

Let A and [formula] be Banach algebras such that A is a Banach [formula]-bimodule with compatible actions, that is

[formula]

for all [formula]. Let X be a Banach A-bimodule and a Banach [formula]-bimodule with compatible actions, that is

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

for all [formula]. Then we say that X is a Banach A-[formula]-module. If

[formula]

then X is called a commutative A-[formula]-module. Moreover, if

[formula]

then X is called a bi-commutative Banach A-[formula]-module.

If X is a commutative Banach A-[formula]-module, then so is X*, where the actions of A and [formula] on X* are defined as usual:

[formula]

[formula]

Note that when A acts on itself by algebra multiplication, it is not in general a Banach A-[formula]-module, as we have not assumed the compatibility condition

[formula]

If A is a commutative [formula]-module and acts on itself by multiplication from both sides, then it is also a Banach A-[formula]-module. Also, if A is a commutative Banach algebra, then it is a bi-commutative A-[formula]-module. In these cases, A(n), nth dual space of A is also a commutative or bi-commutative A-[formula]-module, respectively.

Let A and B be Banach [formula]-modules with compatible actions ([\ref=1e1]). Then a left [formula]-module map is a mapping T:A  →  B with T(a  ±  b) = T(a)  ±  T(b) and T(α  ·  x) = α  ·  T(x) for a∈A,b∈B, and [formula]. A right or two-sided [formula]-module map is defined similarly.

Let A and [formula] be as above and X be a Banach A-[formula]-module. A ([formula]-)module derivation is a bounded [formula]-module map D:A  →  X satisfying

[formula]

One should note that D is not necessarily linear, but its boundedness (defined as the existence of M > 0 such that [formula], for all a∈A) still implies its continuity, as it preserves subtraction. When X is commutative, each x∈X defines a module derivation

[formula]

These are called inner [formula]-module derivations.

We use notations [formula] and [formula] for the set of all module derivations and inner derivations from A to X, respectively. Also the quotient space [formula] (which we call the first [formula]-module cohomology group of A with coefficients in X) is denoted by [formula]. A Banach algebra A is module amenable if [formula], for each commutative Banach A-[formula]-module X [\cite=am1].

It is proved in [\cite=am1] that the homomorphic image of a module amenable Banach algebra under a continuous homomorphism with dense range is also a module amenable Banach algebra. This fact leads to the following result.

Let A be a Banach [formula]-module and I be a closed ideal in A. Then module amenability of A implies module amenability of A  /  I.

Let A be a Banach [formula]-module, I be a closed ideal and [formula]-submodule of A. If I and A  /  I are module amenable, then so is A.

Assume that X be a commutative Banach A-[formula]-module with compatible actions and D:A  →  X* be a bounded module derivation. Since I is module amenable, there exists f1∈X* such that D|I = Df1. Thus, the map [formula] vanishes on I. This map induces a module derivation from A  /  I into X*, which we again denote by [formula]. Let Y be the closed linear span of

[formula]

in X. It follows immediately that Y is a closed A-submodule and [formula]-submodule of X, and so X / Y is a Banach A  /  I-[formula]-module with compatible actions. Since D|I  =  {0}, we have [formula] for all a∈I and b∈A. Similarly, [formula]. This implies [formula]. Due to module amenability of A  /  I, there is [formula] such that [formula]. Consequently, D = Df1 + f2.

Let A and B be Banach [formula]-modules. Then [formula], [formula]-direct sum of A and B is module amenable if and only if A and B are module amenable.

Let A and B be module amenable. Since B, the closed ideal of [formula] and the quotient algebra [formula] are module amenable, [formula] is module amenable by Proposition [\ref=ropo].

Conversely, assume that [formula] is module amenable. Thus [formula] and [formula] are module amenable by Lemma [\ref=corm].

Let A and [formula] be Banach [formula]-bimodules with compatible actions ([\ref=1e1]) and M be a Banach A-bimodule and a Banach [formula]-bimodule with compatible actions ([\ref=1e2]) and ([\ref=1e3]).

Let JM be a subspace of M generated by elements of the form a  ·  (α  ·  x) - (a  ·  α)  ·  x and x  ·  (α  ·  a) - (x  ·  α)  ·  a for [formula] and x∈M. One can see from ([\ref=1e2]) and ([\ref=1e3]) that JM is an A-submodule and [formula]-submodule of M. Note that the equalities ([\ref=1e4]) do not necessarily hold for M. When M  =  A, JA is in fact the closed ideal of A generated by elements of the form (a  ·  α)b - a(α  ·  b) for [formula] (see [\cite=bod], [\cite=bab] and [\cite=pou]).

Let [formula] be triangular Banach algebra equipped with the usual 2 ×   2 matrix addition and formal multiplication. The norm on T is [formula]. Now, let A, B and M be Banach [formula]-bimodules, and let M be a Banach A,B-module (left A-module and right B-module). Similar to [\cite=po], we consider the Banach algebra [formula]. Then, the Banach algebra [formula] with usual [formula] matrix product is a [formula]-bimodule. In fact, That is isomorphic to [formula] as a Banach space and a Banach [formula]-bimodule. The following result is a module version of [\cite=me] and the proof is similar. However, we bring its proof.

Let A,B be Banach [formula]-modules and M be commutative Banach [formula]-module. The triangular Banach algebra T is module amenable (as an [formula]-bimodule) if and only if A and B are module amenable (as Banach [formula]-bimodules) and M = 0.

First note that when T is [formula]-bimodule it means that [formula] is [formula]-bimodule with the usual actions. Now, let A and B are module amenable and M = 0. Then [formula] is module amenable by Proposition [\ref=th2].

Conversely, assume that T is [formula]-module amenable. The Banach algebras [formula] and [formula] are closed ideals of T, and thus A and B are [formula]-module amenable by Lemma [\ref=corm]. Since M is complemented in T, it is module amenable and since M is a commutative [formula]-module, it has a bounded approximate identity by [\cite=am1], hence it should be zero.

Module Arens regularity

For given Γ1,Γ2∈A*  *, by the Goldstein theorem there are nets (a1,i)i and (a2,j)j in A such that Γ1 = w*  -   lim ia1,i and Γ2 = w*  -   lim ja2,j. Then we consider the first Arens product on A*  * as follows: and similarly for any Ψ1,Ψ2∈B*  *, there exist nets (b1,i)i and (b2,j)j such that the first Arens product on B is defined as follows:

We extend the actions of A and B on M to actions of A*  * and B*  * on M*  * via where Γ = w*  -   lim iai, Ψ = w*  -   lim jbj, and Π = w*  -   lim kxk. We define the first Arens product on T*  * in a natural way. Let [formula] so that [formula] and [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Similarly, we consider the second Arens product on A*  *, B*  * and module actions A*  *, B*  * on M*  * as follows: and where Γ1,Γ2∈A*  *, Ψ1,Ψ2∈B*  * and Π∈M*  *. Thus the second Arens product on T*  * can be defined via

[formula]

The concept of module Arens regularity for Banach algebras is defined in [\cite=re]. A Banach algebra A is module Arens regular as a Banach [formula]-module if and only if [formula], for every Γ1,Γ2∈A*  * (see [\cite=re] and [\cite=abeh]).

We say that the Banach algebras A and B act module regularly on M if for each Γ∈A*  *, Ψ∈B*  * and Π∈M*  * we have

[formula]

Recall that the Banach algebras A and B act regularly on A,B-module M if for every Γ∈A*  *, Ψ∈B*  * and Π∈M*  * we have [formula] and [formula] [\cite=fo2]. It follows from the above that A and B act module regularly on M if and only if A / JA and B / JB act regularly on M / JM. Indeed,

[formula]

Similarly, [formula] if and only if [formula]. Similarly we can show that [formula] and thus [formula]. It is shown in [\cite=bab] that JA and JB are the closed subspace of A an B respectively. It is easy to check that JM is also a closed subspace of M. Hence JA,JB and JM are weak*-dense in [formula] and [formula] respectively by [\cite=da1]. Hence [formula] is weak*-dense in [formula]. On the other hand, [formula] is closed subspace of [formula] and so it is weak*-dense in [formula]. Therefore [formula]. Summing up:

Let A and B be Banach [formula]-modules. The triangular Banach algebra T is module Arens regular (as an [formula]-bimodule) if and only if A and B are module Arens regular (as Banach [formula]-bimodules) and A and B act module regularly on M.

(2n-1)-Weak Module Amenability

We start this section with the definition of n-weak module amenability which is introduced in [\cite=bab]. When A is a commutative [formula]-bimodule, we have J = {0} and A is a commutative A-[formula]-module. In this case, the following definition (for n  =  1) coincides with the definition of weak module amenability in [\cite=am3]. If A is a commutative Banach algebra and a commutative [formula]-bimodule with compatible actions, then A is a bi-commutative A-[formula]-module. In this case, for each bi-commutative Banach A-[formula]-module X, all bounded module derivation from A into X are zero (see the next lemma) and we get the definition of weak module amenability for commutative Banach algebras as in [\cite=am3].

Let A be a Banach algebra, [formula]. Then A is called n-weakly module amenable (as an [formula]-module) if (A / J)(n) is a commutative A-[formula]-module, and each module derivation from D:A  →  (A / J)(n) is inner; that is, D(a) = a  ·  y - y  ·  a = :Dy(a) for some y∈(A  /  J)(n) and each a∈A. Also A is called weakly module amenable if it is 1-weakly module amenable and permanently weakly module amenable if it is n-weakly module amenable for each [formula].

Let A be a essential bi-commutative A-[formula]-module. Then A is weakly module amenable (as an [formula]-module) if and only if for each bi-commutative Banach A-[formula]-module X, all bounded module derivation from A into X are zero.

We follow the standard argument in [\cite=da1]. Assume that there exists [formula] with D  ≠  0. Since [formula], there exists a0∈A such that D(a20)  ≠  0. We have a0  ·  D(a0)  ≠  0 and thus f∈X* with f(a0  ·  D(a0)) = 1. Set R:X  →  A* defined by R(x)(a) = f(a  ·  x) where a∈A,x∈X. It is easy to check that [formula]. We get [formula], and so [formula]. This shows that A is not weakly module amenable. The converse is clear.

Let A, B and M be as in the previous section. If these are commutative Banach [formula]-modules, then the corresponding triangular Banach algebra [formula] is a commutative [formula]-module in which [formula]. Also T is isomorphic to [formula] as a Banach [formula]-module and a Banach [formula]-module, respectively. Therefore [formula], while [formula] in which T(n) is Banach [formula]-module and [formula], [formula] are Banach [formula]-modules. Suppose that [formula]and [formula]. Then the pairing of T* and T is given by [formula]. Indeed, it is easy to check that the module actions T on T* are as follows:

[formula]

We remove the dot for simplicity. This process may be repeated to define the actions of T on T(n) as follows: and for every [formula] and [formula].

Henceforth, we assume that A, B and M are commutative Banach [formula]-modules and thus T(2n - 1) and T(2n) become commutative Banach [formula]-modules for any [formula].

The following two lemmas are proved similar to Lemmas 1.1 and 1.2 in [\cite=po].

The [formula]-module map D:T  →  T(2n - 1) is a module derivation if and only if there exist module derivations DA:A  →  A(2n - 1), DB:B  →  B(2n - 1) and γ∈M(2n - 1) such that

[formula]

for every [formula].

Let DA:A  →  A(2n - 1) and DB:B  →  B(2n - 1) be bounded module derivations. Then DAB:T  →  T(2n - 1) defined via

[formula]

is a bounded module derivation. Furthermore, DAB is inner if and only if DA and DB are inner.

Using Lemmas [\ref=po1] and [\ref=po2], and similar to [\cite=po], we have the following result (see also [\cite=me]) .

Let A and B be unital Banach algebras, and M be a unital A,B-module. Then

[formula]

In particular, the triangular Banach algebra T is (2n - 1)-weakly module amenable (as an [formula]-bimodule) if and only if A and B are (2n - 1)-weakly module amenable (as Banach [formula]-bimodules).

A Banach A,B-module M is said to be non-degenerate if Am = {0} implies that m = 0, and mB  =  {0} implies that m = 0 for every m∈M. If the Banach algebras A and B have bounded approximate identity and M is essential, then M is a non-degenerated A,B-module. Also when M is essential, then M* is a non-degenerate Banach A,B-module. Although in the following Proposition A and B are not unital but still the conclusion of Lemma [\ref=po1] holds. In fact we obtain the same result with different conditions.

Let A and B be Banach algebras, and M be Banach A,B-module. Suppose that A possess a bounded approximate identity, A(2n - 1),B(2n - 1) and M(2n - 1) are non-degenerate. Then the [formula]-module map D:T  →  T(2n - 1) is module derivation if and only if there exist module derivations DA:A  →  A(2n - 1), DB:B  →  B(2n - 1) and γ∈M(2n - 1) such that

[formula]

for every [formula].

Let D:T  →  T(2n - 1) be a continuous module derivation. Define DA:A  →  A(2n - 1) by [formula], and DB:B  →  B(2n - 1) via [formula]. Obviously these maps are [formula]-module maps, and are module derivations by [\cite=me]. Let (eα)α∈Λ be a bounded approximate identity of A, and let [formula] for an arbitrary and fixed a∈A. Then

[formula]

Similarly, consider b∈B such that [formula]. Since M(2n - 1) and A(2n - 1) are non-degenerate (see [\cite=me]), we have

[formula]

Also for every m∈M we have

[formula]

Now, from ([\ref=4pp1]), ([\ref=4pp2]) and ([\ref=4pp3]), we get ([\ref=p]), and this completes the proof.

Now we are ready to prove the main theorem of this section (see also the proof of [\cite=po]).

Let A and B both have bounded approximate identity, and let M be non-degenerate. Then for every [formula] we have

[formula]

Furthermore, the corresponding triangular Banach algebra [formula] is (2n - 1)-weakly module amenable (as an [formula]-bimodule) if and only if A and B are (2n - 1)-weakly module amenable (as Banach [formula]-bimodules).

Suppose that D:T  →  T(2n - 1) is a continuous module derivation. Proposition [\ref=prop1] shows that there are continuous module derivations DA:A  →  A(2n - 1), DB:B  →  B(2n - 1) and γ∈M(2n - 1) such that

[formula]

for every [formula]. Define [formula] by

[formula]

Let's show that Ψ is a linear map. If (eα) is a bounded approximate identity for A, then for given [formula] we have

[formula]

and similarly we have

[formula]

Now, by applying relations ([\ref=tt4]) and ([\ref=tt5]) for every [formula] and [formula] in T we get

[formula]

Thus Ψ(λD) = λΨ(D). Obviously, Ψ(D1 + D2) = Ψ(D1) + Ψ(D2) for all [formula]. Hence, Ψ is a linear map. Now, assume that [formula] and [formula]. Then Lemma [\ref=po2] implies that there exists a module derivation DAB such that and this indicates that Ψ is surjective. If D∈ ker Ψ, then Ψ(D) = 0 and thus [formula] and [formula]. Since DA and DB are inner, DAB is an inner module derivation by Lemma [\ref=po2]. Therefore we can write

The above equality shows that D is inner. Thus, [formula]. On the other hand, if [formula], then DA:A  →  A(2n - 1) defined by [formula] and DB:B  →  B(2n - 1) defined by [formula] are inner module derivations. Therefore Ψ(D) = 0, and so [formula]. Finally, we have

[formula]

(2n)-Weak Module Amenability

As it is seen in the previous section, (2n - 1)-weak module amenability of a triangular Banach algebra T depends on (2n - 1)-weak module amenability of Banach algebras A and B while this fails to be true in the even case in general. We need the following lemma which is analogous to [\cite=fo2] in the module case. We include the proof.

Let D:T  →  T(2n) be a continuous module derivation. Then there exist γ∈M(2n), continuous module derivations DA:A  →  A(2n), DB:B  →  B(2n) and a continuous [formula]-module map ρ:M  →  M(2n) such that

[formula],  (a∈A);

[formula],  (b∈B);

[formula],   (m∈M);

ρ(a  ·  m) = DA(a)  ·  m + a  ·  ρ(m),   (a∈A,m∈M);

ρ(m  ·  b) = ρ(m)  ·  b + m  ·  DB(b)   (a∈A,m∈M);

If DA:A  →  A(2n) and DB:B  →  B(2n) are continuous module derivations and ρM:M  →  M(2n) is a continuous [formula]-module map that satisfies () and (). Then D:T  →  T(2n) defined by [formula] is a continuous module derivation.

In the light of [\cite=fo2], we just show that these maps are module maps. Let D be a [formula]-module map. Then

[formula]

for all a1,a2∈A and [formula]. This means that DA(α  ·  a) = α  ·  DA(a), for all a∈A and [formula]. Similarly we can show that DA(a  ·  α) = DA(a)  ·  α and DB and ρ are [formula]-module maps. Therefore the assertions (i)-(v) hold. For (vi), suppose that DA, DB and ρM are [formula]-module maps. We show that D is a [formula]-module map. Given [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

Therefore D(Υ  ·  T1) = Υ  ·  D(T1). Similarly we obtain D(T1  ·  Υ) = D(T1)  ·  Υ. Thus, D is a [formula]-module map.

The following sets which are used in this section are introduced in [\cite=fo2]. For each positive integer n, we define the centralizer of A in A(2n) by ZA(A(2n)) = {x∈A(2n):x  ·  a = a  ·  x for all a∈A} and similarly, ZB(B(2n)) = {z∈B(2n):z  ·  b = b  ·  z for all b∈B}. The elements of

[formula]

are called central Rosenblum operators on M with coefficients in M(2n) in which ρx,z(m) = x  ·  m - m  ·  z is an [formula]-module map. We also define the following set

[formula]

[formula]

The following theorem is analogous to Lemma 3.11 and Theorem 3.12 from [\cite=fo2] in a more general setting (part (iii) is a module version of [\cite=me]).

Let A and B be unital Banach algebras and M be a unital Banach A,B-module. Then we have

[formula]

If [formula] then the map

[formula]

where [formula]. Furthermore ΔΩ is inner if and only if Ω is a central Rosenblum operator on M with coefficients in M(2n).

If A and B are (2n)-weakly module amenable as [formula]-modules, then

[formula]

[formula]

In the other words,

[formula]

For statements (i) and (ii), we only need to show that Δφ is an [formula]-module map. The rest of the proof is the same as [\cite=fo2]. For given [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

and similarly ΔΩ(T  ·  Υ) = ΔΩ(T)  ·  Υ.

For (iii), the proof is similar to [\cite=fo2] but we give the proof for the sake of completeness. Consider

[formula]

defined by [formula], where [formula] denotes the equivalence class of ΔΩ in [formula]. It follows from (ii) that [formula] is an [formula]-module map. Let D:T  →  T(2n) be a module derivation. By Lemma [\ref=l2.1] there are module derivations DA:A  →  A(2n), DB:B  →  B(2n), and a [formula]-module map ρ:M  →  M(2n) and an element γ∈M(2n) such that

[formula]

Since A and B both are (2n)-weakly module amenable, there exist x∈A and y∈B such that DA(a) = a  ·  x - x  ·  a = Dx(a) and DB(b) = b  ·  y - y  ·  b = Dy(b). Define D0:T  →  T(2n) as follows:

[formula]

It is easy to see that D0 is an inner [formula]-module derivation induced by [formula] (note that in the proof of [\cite=fo2], there is a misprint). Set D1 = D - D0. Thus [formula]. Then

[formula]

for all [formula]. Define [formula]. Clearly Ω belongs to

[formula]

By (ii), we have [formula]. This means that [formula] is surjective. Finally, we must show that [formula]. Let [formula]. Then [formula], hence [formula] is inner. Again by (ii), we have Ω∈ZRA,B(M,M(2n)), and (i) implies that [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

The following result may be proved like Proposition [\ref=prop1] using a modification of Lemma [\ref=l2.1].

Let A or B has a bounded approximate identity, and let A(2n), B(2n) and M(2n) be non-degenerate. Then the [formula]-module map D:T  →  T(2n) is a module derivation if and only if there exist module derivations DA:A  →  A(2n) and DB:B  →  B(2n), and [formula]-module map ρ:M  →  M(2n) which satisfies conditions (iv) and (v) of Lemma [\ref=l2.1] such that

[formula]

in which γ∈M(2n) and [formula].

We argue similar to the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop1]. Let D:T  →  T(2n) be a continuous module derivation. Define DA:A  →  A(2n) by [formula], and DB:B  →  B(2n) by [formula]. Obviously these maps are [formula]-module maps, and by [\cite=me], they are module derivations. Let (eα)α∈Λ be a bounded approximate identity of A, and let [formula] for all a∈A. Then

[formula]

Let b∈B and [formula]. Since M(2n) and A(2n) are non-degenerate (see [\cite=me]), we have

[formula]

For m∈M, suppose that [formula], then by [\cite=me], θ  =  μ = 0. Now, we define ρ:M  →  M(2n) by [formula]. It is clear that ρ is an [formula]-module map. Therefore it suffices to show that ρ satisfies in conditions (iv) and (v) of Lemma [\ref=l2.1]. We check these conditions as follows:

[formula]

and similarly we have ρ(m  ·  b) = ρ(m)  ·  b + m  ·  DB(b).

We can now rephrase part (iii) of Theorem [\ref=T5.2] as follows.

Let A or B has a bounded approximate identity, and let A(2n), B(2n) and M(2n) be non-degenerate. If A and B are (2n)-weakly module amenable as [formula]-modules, then

[formula]

Appling Proposition [\ref=P5], the argument of Theorem [\ref=T5.2] can be repeated to obtain the result.

Let A has a bounded approximate identity, and A(2n) be non-degenerate. If A is (2n)-weakly module amenable (as an [formula]-module), then [formula] is (2n)-weakly module amenable (as an [formula]-module).

Let (eα) be a bounded approximate identity of A, and let φ in [formula](A,A(2n)). Then there exists E∈A(2n) and a subnet {φ(eβ)} of {φ(eβ)} such that [formula]. We have Similarly, φ(a) = aE. This shows that [formula] and [formula]=  {0} by Theorem [\ref=T5.4].

Examples

In this section, by using the results of the previous sections we show that under which conditions the Banach algebra [formula] is permanently weakly module amenable and module Arens regular where S is an inverse semigroup.

A discrete semigroup S is called an inverse semigroup if for each s∈S there is a unique element s*∈S such that ss*s = s and s*ss* = s*. An element e∈S is called an idempotent if e = e* = e2. The set of idempotents of S is denoted by E.

Let S be an inverse semigroup with the set of idempotents E. By [\cite=how] E is a commutative subsemigroup of S and a semilattice, [formula] could be regarded as a commutative subalgebra of [formula], and therefore [formula] is a Banach algebra and a Banach [formula]-module with compatible actions [\cite=am1].

Let [formula]. Recall that E satisfies condition Dk [\cite=dun] if given f1,f2,...,fk + 1∈E there exist e∈E and i,j such that

[formula]

Duncan and Namioka in [\cite=dun] proved that for any inverse semigroup S, [formula] has a bounded approximate identity if and only if E satisfies condition Dk for some k.

Let S be a commutative inverse semigroup with the set of idempotents E. Consider [formula] as an [formula]-module with the following action:

[formula]

Let [formula] and let S be a commutative inverse semigroup with the set of idempotents E. Then [formula] is n-weakly module amenable as an [formula]-module with the actions (6.1).

For any semigroup S, group algebra [formula] is commutative if and only if S is commutative. Since [formula] is a bi-commutative Banach [formula]-[formula]-module, so is [formula]. By [\cite=am3], [formula] is weakly module amenable as an [formula]-module. The semigroup algebra [formula] is essential, in fact [formula] (see the proof of [\cite=bab]). Now, it follows from Lemma [\ref=deff] that every module derivation from [formula] into [formula] is zero. This shows that [formula] is n-weakly module amenable.

In [\cite=po], the authors proved that the Banach algebra [formula] is weak [formula]-module amenable in which [formula], where S is a unital commutative inverse semigroup. The condition of being unital for S is rather strong and it can be replaced by the weaker condition that E satisfies condition Dk for some k.

Let S be a commutative inverse semigroup such that E satisfies condition Dk for some k. By Theorem [\ref=t2] we have where T0 is a Banach [formula]-module. Since [formula] is n-weakly module amenable (Theorem [\ref=tn]), T0 is (2n + 1)-weakly module amenable (as [formula]-module) again by Theorem [\ref=t2]. On the other hand, [formula] possess a bounded approximate identity, and thus T0 is (2n)-weakly module amenable by Corollary [\ref=corf]. Therefore T0 is permanently weakly module amenable.

Here, for technical reasons, we let [formula] act on [formula] by multiplication from right and trivially from left, that is

[formula]

In this case, the ideal J (see section 2) is the closed linear span of {δset  -  δst  s,t∈S,e∈E}. We consider an equivalence relation on S as follows:

[formula]

For an inverse semigroup S, the quotient S  /    ≈   is a discrete group (see [\cite=am2] and [\cite=pou]). Indeed, S  /    ≈   is homomorphic to the maximal group homomorphic image GS [\cite=mn] of S [\cite=pou2]. In particular, S is amenable if and only if GS is amenable [\cite=dun] [\cite=mn].

The Banach algebra T0 is module Arens regular (as an Banach [formula]-module) if and only if [formula] is module Arens regular as an [formula]-module with trivial left action and canonical right action by Theorem [\ref=the2]. Now it follows from [\cite=re] that T0 is module Arens regular if and only if is GS is finite.
