Endomorphisms of stable continuous-trace C*-algebras

46L05, 46M20

Introduction

The structure of automorphisms of continuous-trace [formula]-algebras was studied by Lance ([\cite=Lance]) and Smith ([\cite=Smith]) (the case of C(X) - automorphisms of [formula], or more precisely [formula]), and subsequently by Phillips and Raeburn ([\cite=PR], see also [\cite=Rosenberg],[\cite=RW]) for general continuous trace [formula]-algebras.

This paper is concerned with the question of generalizing some of those results to the situation of 'unital' endomorphisms of stable continuous-trace [formula]-algebras. We refer the reader to [\cite=RW] and [\cite=Dixmier] for general references on the theory of continuous-trace [formula]-algebras.

Throughout the paper, X will denote a locally compact Hausdorff space; H will denote a separable Hilbert space and B(H) will denote the bounded operators on H; M(A) will denote the multiplier algebra of A; K will denote the algebra of compact operators on a separable Hilbert space; automorphisms, endomorphisms and homomorphisms between [formula]-algebras and [formula]-bundles will always be *  -homomorphisms; δ(A) will denote the Dixmier-Douady invariant of a continuous-trace [formula]-algebra A. By a unital homomorphism between two non-unital [formula]-algebras we mean a homomorphism which maps approximate units to approximate units.

We recall that every stable continuous-trace [formula]-algebra for which all the irreducible representations act on a separable space is isomorphic to the algebra of sections of a locally trivial K-bundle over a locally compact Hausdorff space. Let E be a locally trivial K-bundle over X, and let A  =  Γ0(E). Denote by AutX(A) the automorphisms of A which commute with the multiplication action of C0(X) on A, and by Inn(A) the group of inner automorphisms of A, i.e. those automorphisms of A which are given by α(A)  =  UAU* for some U∈M(A). Denote by Homeoδ(X) the group of homeomorphisms of X which preserve [formula], where cohomology here is taken to mean ech cohomology. The result of Phillips and Raeburn, specialized to this case, can be summarized in the following exact sequence.

[formula]

Of course, some of this structure must be lost when generalizing to endomorphisms. The fact that the endomorphisms do not form a group means that speaking of exact sequences won't make much sense.

This paper will be devoted to providing an adequate generalization to sequence ([\ref=eqn:PRseq1]). Our invariant takes values in vector bundles over X. We will show that the associated vector bundle of a C0(X)-endomorphism α, denoted vect(α), classifies α up to inner automorphism (i.e. [formula]); that all numerable vector bundles over X arise in this way; and that we have a product formula [formula] (in other words, vect is a semigroup homomorphism from the semigroup of endomorphisms under composition to vector bundles under tensor products).

The invariant for C0(X)-automorphisms in this approach will be a complex line bundle over X. So if we specialize the above results to automorphisms, then we get a similar sequence to ([\ref=eqn:PRseq1]) (with the group of complex line bundles over X, which is isomorphic to [formula], on the right).

The structure of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we study the space of endomorphisms of K. In section 3, we discuss the case of C0(X)-endomorphism s of [formula]. In section 4, we generalize the main results of section 3 to algebras with possibly non-trivial Dixmier-Douady invariant.

Endomorphisms of K

Let α be an endomorphism of K which is unital, in the sense that it maps approximate units to approximate units.

Let n be the trace of α(P) for a minimal projection P∈K, where by trace we mean the unique (unbounded) trace on K+ whose value on minimal projections is 1. This n clearly is independent of the choice of P, and will be called index(α).

The following simple lemma and its short proof was conveyed to the author by W. B. Arveson.

There are isometries [formula] with

[formula]

such that for all A∈K,

[formula]

Proof:  Letting K act irreducibly on some space H, we observe that α gives a representation of K on H. This representation decomposes into a direct sum of n irreducible representations on pairwise orthogonal subspaces [formula], and there are isometries Si from H onto Hi, i = 1,...,n which implement α|Hi, i.e. SiAS*iξi  =  α(A)ξi for ξi∈Hi. The lemma follows from this immediately.

Notice that we have SiA  =  α(A)Si, i = 1,...,n. Let

[formula]

Vα is clearly a vector space. It also has a natural inner product on it. If [formula] then T*SA = AT*S for all A∈K, and therefore T*S is a scalar multiple of the identity, and indeed [formula] is an inner product.

The Si's are an orthonormal basis for Vα.

Proof:  Let [formula] then [formula], as required. Orthonormality is immediate.

If T1,...,Tm are isometries such that [formula] for all A∈K then clearly m = index(α) = n, and the Ti's form another orthonormal basis for Vα. Conversely, if T1,...,Tn are an orthonormal basis for Vα then it is straightforward to verify that [formula] for all A∈K.

Denote by End(K) the space of unital endomorphisms of K, endowed with the point-norm topology, and by Endn(K) the subset of endomorphisms of index n. Notice that End(K) (and hence all the Endn(K)'s) is metrizable, hence paracompact (if A1,A2,... is a dense sequence in the unit sphere of K, then [formula] is a metric inducing the point-norm topology).

Proof:  Let αk  →  α. Let P be a minimal projection, then for sufficiently large k, we have [formula]. Therefore, αk(P) and α(P) are Murray-von-Neumann equivalent, and in particular they have the same trace, i.e. index(αk)  →  index(α). (cf [\cite=Price] Proposition 2.3)

We denote by Cn  ⊆  B(H)n the space of all n-tuples of isometries satisfying the Cuntz relations, equipped with the strong operator topology. We remark that Cn is metrizable (since the unit sphere of B(H) is metrizable in the SOT), hence paracompact. We described above a surjective map π:Cn  →  Endn(K), given by [formula]. Suppose (S(k)1,...,S(k)n)  →  (S1,...,Sn) in Cn, and let [formula] a rank 1 operator, then

[formula]

[formula]

so π is continuous.

We define the universal intertwining bundle

[formula]

to be the sub-bundle of Endn(K)  ×  B(H) whose fiber over α is Vα (where the topology on B(H) is the strong operator topology).

[formula]

is the corresponding principal Un-bundle (the bundle of orthonormal frames).

π:Cn  →  Endn(K) has local cross sections. In other words, the bundles above are locally trivial.

Proof:  (cf [\cite=RW], Proposition 1.6) We think of K as acting irreducibly on H. Fix α∈Endn(K), and let [formula] be a fixed minimal projection. Let ω1,...,ωn be an orthonormal basis for α(P)H, and define Si∈B(H), i = 1,..,n by [formula].

For any i,j∈1,...,n, and ξ,η∈H, we have

[formula]

[formula]

so S1,...,Sn are isometries with orthogonal ranges.

Let [formula], and let ζ∈H, then

[formula]

[formula]

so Si is an intertwiner.

Therefore, π(S1,...,Sn)  =  α. Now, define f1,...,fn:Endn(K)  →  H by

[formula]

The fi are all clearly continuous, and fi(α)  =  ωi. Therefore, there is an open neighborhood N of α in which f1,...,fn are linearly independent. Let g1,...,gn:N  →  H be obtained from f1,...,fn via the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process, then the gi's are continuous as well. Now, let s1,...,sn:N  →  B(H) be given by

[formula]

then the si's are clearly continuous (when B(H) is given the strong operator topology), and from the above, we have (s1(β),...,sn(β))∈Cn for all β, and π(s1(β),...,sn(β))  =  β, so we have a local cross section, as required.

Proof:  Let [formula] be the unilateral shifts, pt  =  1 - vtv*t, (T1',...,Tn') some fixed n-tuple of isometries satisfying the Cuntz relations on a separable Hilbert space H'. Identify [formula], and let [formula], [formula], [formula], i = 1,..,n. Define a family of maps Φt:Cn  →  Cn by

[formula]

then it is easy to see Φt is SOT-continuous in t, that Φt(S1,...,Sn)∈Cn for all (S1,...,Sn)∈Cn, and that and SOT -  lim Φt(S1,...,Sn)  =  (T1,...,Tn) for any (S1,...,Sn)∈Cn, so Φt gives us a contraction as required.

Recall that an open cover {Uλ} of a topological space Y is said to be numerable if there is a locally finite partition of unity {fμ} such that the open cover {f- 1μ((0,1])} refines {Uλ}. Notice that if Y is paracompact then any open cover is numerable. A principal Un-bundle ζ over Y is said to be numerable if there is a numerable open cover {Uλ} of Y such that ζ|Uλ is trivial for all λ. If Y is paracompact then any locally trivial bundle is numerable. The pull back of a numerable bundle is also numerable. A numerable principal Un-bundle over a space B is said to be universal if

Any numerable principal Un-bundle over some space Y is isomorphic to a pull-back bundle of this bundle via a map Y  →  B.

Two maps Y  →  B give rise to isomorphic pull-back bundles if and only if they are homotopic.

A universal Hermitian vector bundle is defined in the analogous way, and a Hermitian vector bundle is universal if and only if its associated principal Un-bundle is universal.

By a theorem of Dold ([\cite=Dold] Theorem 7.5), a numerable principal Un-bundle is universal if and only if the total space is contractible.

C0(X)-Endomorphisms of [formula]

We now turn to study endomorphisms of [formula] which commute with the multiplier action of C0(X). We refer to those as C0(X)-endomorphism s.

Let σ:X  →  End(K) be a continuous map, then there is a C0(X)-endomorphism   α of [formula] given by α(f)(x)  =  σ(x)(f(x)). Furthermore, any C0(X)-endomorphism   α of [formula] is of this form.

Proof:  The proof is straightforward (and virtually identical to Lemma 4.28 in [\cite=RW], using endomorphisms instead of automorphisms), and the details are left to the reader.

We henceforth denote this map by x  ↦  αx.

[formula]

Notice that vect(α) is the pull-back of the universal intertwining bundle(s) via the map x  →  αx (where possibly the dimension may be different on different components of X; by Proposition [\ref=prop:continuous_n], the dimension will be locally constant). In particular, vect(α) is numerable.

Proof:  Define a map

[formula]

by

[formula]

Verifying that this map is a well defined bundle isomorphism is immediate.

The associated vector bundle to a C0(X)-endomorphism   classifies the C0(X)-endomorphism   up to homotopy. A more natural equivalence relation on C0(X)-endomorphism s is classification up to inner automorphism, i.e., α  ~  β if there is a unitary U in [formula] such that [formula]. The following proposition shows that the two equivalence relations coincide.

We give two proofs of this theorem. The first proves the theorem directly, using the preceeding observation. The second proof uses a modified argument from [\cite=Powers] (Theorem 2.4) to show that equivalence up to inner automorphism coincides with equivalence up to homotopy.

Proof 1: If [formula] where γ is an inner automorphism, then by theorem [\ref=thm:product_formula] we have [formula]. But vect(γ) is the trivial line bundle, so [formula].

For the converse, [formula] means that there is an isomorphism between them, i.e. a unitary element in Hom(vect(α),vect(β)), which by observation [\ref=obs:hom_bundle] can be viewed as a sub-bundle of X  ×  B(H). So we know that there is a unitary section U of this sub-bundle (and in particular, [formula]), and any such section can immediately be seen to satisfy Uα(A)U*  =  β(A) for all [formula], i.e. [formula], as required.

Proof 2: Suppose U implements an equivalence between α and β. U can be thought of as a function u:X  →  U(H). We know that U(H) is contractible (by theorem [\ref=thm:contractibility] for example, observing that [formula]). Therefore, there is a path of functions ut:X  →  U(H), continuous when viewed as functions X  ×  [0,1]  →  U(H), such that u0  =  u, [formula]. Let Ut be the corresponding path of unitaries in [formula], then [formula] implements a homotopy between α and β.

Conversely, suppose α and β are homotopic. Let eij [formula] be matrix units for K, and let [formula]. So the projections α(E11), β(E11) are homotopic (where by that we mean the canonical extensions of α, β applied to E11). Since homotopic projections are unitarily equivalent (see, for example, [\cite=Blackadar] chapter 4), we can find a unitary V such that Vα(E11)V*  =  β(E11), and therefore we can find a partial isometry [formula] with W*W  =  α(E11), WW*  =  β(E11). Let [formula], the sum taken in the strict topology. It is straightforward to verify that U is unitary. Now, the span of the elements of the form [formula], where f∈C0(X) is dense in [formula], and

[formula]

Composition of C0(X)-endomorphism s maps under vect to tensor products. One might ask if there is a natural operation on C0(X)-endomorphism s which is taken to the direct (Whitney) sum. We can indeed construct such an operation, as follows. Let [formula] be two isometries such that s1s*1  +  s2s*2  =  1, and let α,β be C0(X)-endomorphism s of [formula], then we can define [formula] by

[formula]

While the definition depends, of course, on the choice of s1,s2, this direct sum construction is unique up to homotopy, and hence by theorem [\ref=thm:homotopy_=_inner], up to equivalence via an inner automorphism. The uniqueness up to homotopy follows easily from the fact that each pair (s1,s2) corresponds in the obvious way to a map X  →  C2, and any two such maps are homotopic, since C2 is contractible (theorem [\ref=thm:contractibility]).

Define a map

[formula]

by

[formula]

where s1(x),s2(x) are the two isometries obtain by evaluating the map X  →  C2 at x. To verify that this is a bundle map, we first have to see that [formula]. Let us denote the maps X  →  End(K) corresponding to α,β by x  ↦  αx,βx, respectively, and fix x∈X, then for any A∈K,

[formula]

[formula]

so indeed [formula]. Ψ is clearly a bundle map, so now it remains to show that it is an isomorphism. Since s1(x),s2(x) are isometries, Ψ is injective. For surjectivity, let [formula]. Let T1  =  s1(x)*T,T2  =  s2(x)*T then for any A∈K, we have

[formula]

[formula]

and similarly we have T2A  =  βx(A)T2, so [formula] and [formula], so Ψ is surjective.

We conclude the section with a summary of the main results.

Conclusion:

To each C0(X)-endomorphism  α of [formula] we associate the bundle vect(α) of intertwining operators.

vect(α) is numerable, and any numerable vector bundle arises as vect(α) for some C0(X)-endomorphism  α.

[formula] if and only if [formula] for some [formula].

[formula]

vect(α) is a trivial bundle if and only if the endomorphism is inner, in the sense that there exist isometries [formula] such that [formula].

C0(X)-Endomorphisms of Stable Continuous-Trace [formula]-algebras

Let E be a numerable fiber bundle over X with fiber K and structure group Aut(K), and let Γ0(E) be the [formula]-algebra of sections. The purpose of this section is to generalize the main results of the previous section to this case.

Note that M(Γ0(E))) can be identified with the sections of a bundle with fiber B(H) and the same Dixmier-Douady class (see [\cite=PR], Proposition 2.15 and the following remark). We refer to this bundle henceforth as the multiplier bundle of E. Denote by Bx the fiber of the multiplier bundle over a point x∈X. For a C0(X)-endomorphism  α, we denote by αx the action of α on the fiber over x (coming from the induced action of α on the quotient algebra corresponding to the primitive ideal represented by x), and then as before, we can define

[formula]

Since E is locally trivial, we see that the restriction of vect(α) to each trivialization of E is locally trivial, and hence it is also locally trivial.

vect(α) determines α as above: if N  ⊆  X is such that vect(α)|N,E|N are trivial, then choose orthonormal sections S1,...,Sn of the restricted bundle, and then [formula] for A∈Γ(E|N); those restrictions determine α.

If there is a unitary U∈M(Γ0(E)) such that α(A)  =  U*β(A)U for all A∈Γ0(E) then TAx  =  αx(Ax)T if and only if (UxT)Ax  =  βx(Ax)(UxT), so left multiplication by U gives a vector bundle isomorphism [formula].

Conversely, suppose [formula]. Note that as before, Hom(vect(α),vect(β)) is isomorphic to the sub-bundle of the multiplier bundle whose fiber over x is span{TS*  |  T∈vect(β)  ,  S∈vect(α)}. Since there exists a unitary element in Hom(vect(α),vect(β)), we know that there is a unitary section U of the above sub-bundle (and in particular, U∈M(Γ0(E))), and any such U satisfies Uα(A)U*  =  β(A) for all A∈Γ0(E).

So, as in the case of C0(X)-endomorphism s of [formula], we constructed a map vect from C0(X)-endomorphism s to vector bundles such that [formula] if and only if α and β are equivalent via an inner automorphism. The product formula from theorem [\ref=thm:product_formula] extends as well to this situation, with essentially the same proof.

If E1,E2 are two locally trivial K-bundles over X, then [formula] is a locally trivial K-bundle over X, and if α1,α2 are C0(X)-endomorphism s of Γ(E1),Γ(E2) respectively then we can have a C0(X)-endomorphism   [formula] of [formula].

Let E1,E2 be two locally trivial K-bundles over X, and let α1,α2 be C0(X)-endomorphism s of Γ(E1),Γ(E2), respectively.

[formula]

If φ:Γ(E1)  →  Γ(E2) is an isomorphism commuting with the multiplier action of C0(X) then [formula]

(cf [\cite=RW] lemma 6.6)

Proof:  Let M1,M2 denote the multiplier bundles of E1,E2 respectively. We denote by [formula] the fiber-wise tensor product bundle, where the tensor product is taken to be the spatial tensor product, and observe that [formula] is canonically the multiplier bundle of [formula]. [formula] is a sub-bundle of [formula], as is [formula], and it is immediate to verify that they are in fact the same. That proves (1). (2) follows immediately from the product formula (the extension of theorem [\ref=thm:product_formula]).

We can now obtain surjectivity of vect as follows (cf [\cite=RW], p. 160). Suppose v is a given numerable vector bundle. Let E be our given K-bundle, and let E0 be the trivial bundle. By the results of the previous section, there exists a C0(X)-endomorphism  α0 of [formula] with [formula]. Note that vect(idΓ0(E)) is the trivial line bundle ε0 over X. Define a C0(X)-endomorphism  α of Γ0(E) by [formula], then

[formula]

If α is a given endomorphism Γ0(E), let Eop be the opposite bundle, and let [formula], then α0 is an endomorphism of [formula], and as above, [formula], and we know that vect(α0) is numerable, hence vect(α) is numerable as well.
