Introduction

One of the present major challenges in string theory is that of extending the AdS/CFT duality to more general gravity/gauge theory relations, valid in non-conformal situations. A possibility is that of considering fractional branes in singular spaces such as conifolds (corresponding to N = 1 gauge theory) [\cite=KN] or orbifolds (corresponding to N = 2 gauge theory).

Supergravity solutions dual to non-conformal theories are generically singular. Some stringy mechanism (like the conifold deformation [\cite=KS] or the enhan con [\cite=JPP] mechanism in the orbifold cases) is expected to repair the singularities so as to match the true IR behaviour of the field theory.

In this communication, based on [\cite=noi], we deal with N = 2 gauge theories arising from fractional brane configurations, where one has good control on the field theory side (through the Seiberg-Witten [\cite=SW] exact low energy effective action) and on the string theory side (strings on an orbifold). This allows for detailed comparisons at the perturbative level and (hopefully) at the level of instanton corrections.

Fractional branes on the [formula] orbifold have been thoroughly investigated in the literature [\cite=BVFLMP] [\cite=PRZ]. By considering the more general case of fractional brane configurations on [formula], we find a very elegant agreement of the gravitational solutions, regulated by appropriate enhan cons, with the perturbative treatment of the corresponding gauge theories. We also get more insight on the role of the flux of the RR five-form.

Closed and open strings on [formula]

We consider type IIB string theory on a space-time of the form [formula], in which fractional D3-branes, transverse to the orbifold, are located at the orbifold singularity z1 = z2 = 0 (having indicated as [formula] the coordinates of [formula]). Γ is a discrete subgroup of SU(2), acting on [formula] by

[formula]

with [formula] the defining 2-dim representation; the origin is clearly a fixed point. The Kleinian subgroups Γ are ADE-classified (for instance, the [formula] cyclic groups correspond to An - 1 algebras) through the McKay correspondence [\cite=McKay]: in the Clebsh-Gordan series

[formula]

ÂIJ turns out to be the adjacency matrix of an extended Dynkin diagram of a simply-laced Lie algebra GΓ. So, decomposing I = (0,i), the irreducible representations Di correspond to the nodes of the diagram, i.e., to the simple roots αi; the trivial irrep D0 corresponds to the extra node in the extended diagram, i.e., to [formula]. The dimensions di of the irrespses correspond to the Dynkin labels (while of course d0 = 1). It is important in the following the fact that the extended Cartan matrix [formula] is semidefinite positive, and admits the null eigenvector dI: ĈIJdJ = 0.

The orbifold [formula] is singular at the origin. Resolving this singularity in a canonical way produces [\cite=Kronheimer] an Asymptotically Locally Euclidean (ALE) space MΓ. This space has a non-trivial middle homology H2(MΓ), generated by two-spheres ei arising in the resolution. The intersection form of these "exceptional" cycles is the (non-extended) Cartan matrix of GΓ: ei  ·  ej  =   - Cij. By Poincaré duality, the ALE space possesses a set of anti-self-dual two-forms ωi such that

[formula]

Closed type IIB strings in this orbifold background admit an exact SCFT description [\cite=Aleman]; in the untwisted sectors only Γ-invariant states are retained, and there are additional states from the twisted sectors. The twisted sectors are in correspondence with the conjugacy classes of Γ; in these sectors the momentum has no components along the directions in which Γ acts, so the twisted fields have a 6-dimensional dynamics and are stuck at the fixed point of the orbifold. Viewing "geometrically" the orbifold background as the singular limit of the ALE space for vanishing two-cycles, the low-energy supergravity theory can be obtained à la Kaluza-Klein: in particular, decomposing the closed string massless fields on the two-forms ωi dual to the cycles reproduces the spectrum of twisted fields. In our solution, the following twisted scalar fieldswill be crucial:

[formula]

Reducing type IIB sugra on the singular orbifold, one arrives to the bulk supergravity action (restricted to the fields that will be turned on in the fractional brane solutions)

[formula]

where [formula] is self-dual, and [formula]. Also, one has κ  =  8π7 / 2gs(α')2  =  2π3 / 2gs (we use 2πα' = 1).

When we introduce also D3 branes transverse to the orbifold space [\cite=quiver] the resulting open strings carry Chan-Paton factors that specify to which D3-branes they are attached. The group Γ may act on the Chan-Paton factors as well as on the string fields along the [formula] directions. If we want a D3 to be located at a generic point p inside the orbifold, then the image branes at gp, g∈Γ, fill a complete orbit. The Chan-Paton indices of open strings attached to such branes transform in the regular representation of Γ; such configurations are called regular or bulk branes. However, the regular representation decomposes as [formula], so a regular brane at the origin of the orbifold (which is fixed under Γ) it can decompose into fractional branes. A fractional brane of type I corresponds to Chan-Paton indices in the irrep DI, and is stuck at the fixed point [\cite=Douglas:1996xg]. In relation with the gauge theory living on the branes, the position of a regular D3-brane inside [formula] corresponds to the Higgs branch, while the positions of its fractional constituents in the x4,x5 plane correspond, as we will see, to the Coulomb branch.

The fractional branes can be described as boundary states in the orbifold SCFT [\cite=DG] [\cite=BCR], but admit also a (quasi)-geometrical interpretation as D5 branes wrapped on the vanishing cycles ei. By either methods, it is possible to infer the world-volume action for a collection of {mI} fractional branes of the various types:

[formula]

Here the tension has the usual expression [formula], and the twisted RR 4-forms A4,J, arising from [formula], are dual in 6 dimensions to the scalars cI. Notice from Eq. ([\ref=b2]) that the tension and charge of a brane of type I are proportional to the twisted field bI.

The gauge theory on the brane

The gauge theory living on a configuration of fractional D3 branes is determined by the spectrum (and interactions) of the massless open string fields stretching between such branes and surviving the orbifold projection, taking into account also the action of Γ on the Chan-Paton factors. The result is that there is a U(mI) N = 2 gauge multiplet from the strings stretching between the mI branes of type I. Moreover, there are ÂIJ hypermultiplets in the (mI,J) representation of U(mI) and U(mJ) respectively, from strings stretched between branes of type I and J; namely, the number of hypermultiplets from such strings is the number of links between the nodes I and J in the extended Dynkin diagram associated to Γ. The β-functions of the various U(mI) gauge factors have only one-loop perturbative contributions. The coefficients are given by

[formula]

the positive contributions being from the gauge multiplet, the negative ones from the matter hypermultiplets. Thus, if we define a bare coupling I at an UV scale ρ0, it dimensionally transmutes into a RG invariant scale ΛI and the (complexified) coupling constants run as described by

[formula]

This N = 2 theory has a moduli space, parametrized by the v.e.v.'s of the adjoint complex scalars in the vector multiplets, [formula], and by the masses Mk ([formula]) of the hypers. A Seiberg-Witten description of the low energy effective action is possible. The effective couplings have a perturbative part, which is determined by one-loop diagrams with massive vector- and hyper-multiplets running in the loop, plus non-perturbative corrections due to instantonic effects. The analysis of [\cite=PRZ] in the [formula] case indicates that in the limit of many branes the instantonic effects arise very suddenly near the scales ΛI and, below ΛI, the couplings τI tend to stop running.

The supergravity solution vs the gauge theory

The equations of motion following from the bulk and boundary actions Eq. ([\ref=sei]) and Eq. ([\ref=b2]) for the metric and the RR five-form (for the explicit expressions see [\cite=noi]) can be solved with the usual D3 brane ansatz in terms of a function H which depends upon all the transverse coordinates, z and [formula]. The other untwisted fields, in particular the dilaton φ and the RR scalar C0 are trivial. The only excited twisted fields are the scalars γi  =  ci  -  ibi; they depend only on z. One finds that the choice of constant dilaton and axion is consistent provided γi(z) are analytic functions. This being the case, one can also prove that half susies are preserved in the bulk (see [\cite=GMMP] in the case of a non-collapsing ALE).

Solving the eq. of motion for the twisted scalars we find in fact the harmonic functions:

[formula]

where ΛI are introduced as IR (small z) regulators. We see that these fields have exactly the same logarithmic running as the gauge couplings, suggesting the correspondence

[formula]

In this perspective, z corresponds to the complexified energy scale, ΛI to the dynamically generated scales; moreover, the distance |z| = ρ0 where the twisted fields attain their perturbative orbifold value bI  =  dI / |Γ| corresponds to the UV scale where the bare theory is defined, with bare coupling 2I  =  4πgs  |Γ| / dI.

This RG/twisted field duality can be justified in the brane-probe approach. Indeed, a single test brane of type I placed at a point z on the fixed plane in the background generated by a configuration of {mI} branes is BPS. The effective two-derivative action for the U(1) living on the test brane is found to be an N = 2 effective theory with coupling τI(z), z being the position of the probe, where τI(z), see Eqs. ([\ref=solgamma],[\ref=corrgamma]) is the twisted scalar generated by the background. This is the same answer given by the perturbative part of the Seiberg-Witten prepotential for this particular breaking of U(mI + 1) to U(1)  ×  U(mI). These perturbative contributions arise from 1-loop diagrams in which the massive vector- and hyper-multiplet fields run in the loop and correspond to loops of open strings stretched between the test brane and the background branes. Upon open/closed duality, these diagrams correpond to the tree-level propagation of massless closed strings, the twisted scalars, from the background branes to the probe, that is, to the evaluation of the probe action in the classical background. The situation is similar to the relations between RG flows and NS-NS tadpoles found in different models [\cite=BM] [\cite=AA].

Besides the twisted fields, the fractional brane solution displays a non-trivial metric and RR 4-form, parametrized by the function H(z,xi). The effective tension and RR charge of a type I fractional branes, proportional to bI(z), attains its orbifold value dI / |Γ| at the UV scale ρ0, while it vanishes at the enhan con radius ΛI. The construction of the boundary action is justified at the orbifold point, but we assume we can trust it down to ΛI, where instanton effects become very suddenly important. So we consider the fractional branes of each type i to be located on an enhan con shell of radius Λi in the z-plane (and those of type 0 at a point where b0 = 1). The solution of the RR 4-form and Einstein equation involves IR divergent integrations, which are regulated via the enhan cons (recall that by Seiberg-Witten analysis [\cite=PRZ] the twisted fields γi are expected to basically stop running below their enhan con); see also [\cite=Merlatti]. Above the highest enhan con, the function H can be expressed in terms of the UV cutoff ρ0 as

[formula]

where ρ2  =  (x4)2  +  (x5)2, [formula] and r2  =  ρ2  +  σ2. At lower scales, the expression is modified as the various types of twisted fields contribute only above the corresponding enhan con. Without these modifications, the metric exhibits singularities where H = 0.

The flux Φ5(ρ) that measures the RR D3-charge contained within a surface Σ comprising a disk of radius ρ in fixed z-plane is found to be, for ρ above the highest enahn con,

[formula]

where Q(ρ) = mIbI(ρ) is the D3 charge encoded in the boundary action. The logarithmic running of the five-form flux is quite general for fractional brane solutions, and is expected to be related to a measure of the degrees of freedom of the system. In our case, notice that for any configuration, we always have ĈIJmImJ  ≥  0, so that the flux, i.e. the untwisted charge Q(ρ) is always decreasing towards the IR. It satisfies the differential equation

[formula]

where we introduced the logarithmic derivatives of the twisted scalars, [formula] =  i / (2π), that is the β-functions for the gauge couplings τi, and the metric [formula] appearing in the kinetic terms for the twisted scalars themselves, as it can be seen from Eq. ([\ref=sei]) and Eq. ([\ref=quattro]). The behaviour of the five-form flux has thus a very suggestive formal analogy with that of the holographic c-function of [\cite=AGPZ], which satisfies dc / d ln ρ  =  2βijGij. Though the latter is defined in the different context of 5-dimensional gauged supergravity, still we think this analogy, to be better investigated, supports the possible relation of the flux to a sensible measure of the degrees of freedom of the system.
