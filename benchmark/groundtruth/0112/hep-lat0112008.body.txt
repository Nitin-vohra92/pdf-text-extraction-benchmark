Dimensional reduction is a powerful technique to study the high-temperature behaviour of gauge theories. The efficiency of this method was tested in a detailed investigation of the reduction to 2D of (2+1)D QCD [\cite=paper1],[\cite=paper2], showing that it is valid down to temperatures T as low as 1.5 times Tc, the critical temperature for deconfinement in (2+1)D. As it is standard, the reduced model was derived from a perturbative expansion in powers of the (static) time component A0 of the gauge field, the non-static components being integrated out at one loop order. Such an expansion breaks the Z3 symmetry which the effective model for the Polyakov loops would have. Hence the reduced model, shown to work in the high T phase of the full theory, cannot predict confinement as T is lowered. Here we present a candidate for a Z3-symmetric reduced action. A similar approach for (3+1)D and possible consequences for QCD were discussed by Pisarski [\cite=Pisarski:2000eq].

In the standard reduction, the 2D lattice action has the form [\cite=paper1]

[formula]

where [formula] is the 2D Wilson action and [formula] the gauge invariant kinetic term for the adjoint "Higgs" A0

[formula]

[formula]

The local potential is

[formula]

The couplings are functions of the 3D gauge coupling g3, which sets the scale, and temperature T:

[formula]

Instead of A0, we start with the Polyakov loop [formula], whose gauge and Z3-invariant kinetic term is

[formula]

We then construct a local potential SV in V, again gauge and Z3-symmetric. Since V is an SU(3) matrix, gauge invariance implies that SV depends on two independent variables only at each lattice point, [formula] and [formula] for example, whose two independent and Z3-invariant combinations are |v(x)|2 and [formula].

Since 〈v(x)〉 is an order parameter for Z3, it vanishes in the symmetric phase, and in this phase we expect that the effective action may be truncated to the two above lowest order terms in v(x). We write for it

[formula]

Suppose now we move in the λ2,λ3 plane from a point in the symmetric phase and cross a Z3 breaking transition line. In the broken phase, we may expand the action in A0 around zero mod(2π / 3) and determine λ2 and λ3 in such a way the terms of order 2 and 4 match the action ([\ref=old]). The result is

[formula]

Preliminary results of a numerical investigation with the action ([\ref=newaction],[\ref=newcoeff]) indicate that a second order phase transition does exist. A study of properties of the Z3-broken phase is under way, with the aim to compare the Polyakov loops correlations in both the former and the new model at high temperature.
