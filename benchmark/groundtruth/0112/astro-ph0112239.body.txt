The BeppoSAX View on the 2001 Reactivation of SGR 1900+14

The 2001 reactivation of SGR 1900+14

On April 18, 2001 at 07:55:11.509 UT the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM, 40-700 keV) onboard BeppoSAX was triggered by a large flare. The event was also observed by the unit 1 of the BeppoSAX Wide Field Cameras (WFCs, 2-28 keV), that was automatically shut-down few seconds after the start of the event by an onboard safeguard algorithm. The WFC localized this giant flare as originating from the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1900+14.

The BeppoSAX GRBM unit 1, co-aligned to WFC unit 1, detected a peak flux of 16,400 counts/s (40-700 keV, after deadtime correction), corresponding to (1.1±  0.1)[formula] erg cm- 2 s- 1. The event lasted approximately 40 s, and the total fluence was about 240,000 counts. A 5-s periodic modulation of the light curve is consistent with the 5.17-s period of the persistent X-ray source. In the light curve of the flare we can identify the repetition of 5 or 6 cycles, and a last pulse that is out of phase with respect to the previous ones. Assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung spectral shape, from our 2-channel, 1-s resolved spectrum, we can derive a plasma temperature kT of ~  30 keV. There is no evidence for a hard spike at the start of the event, and the spectral evolution during the event is relatively smooth, with a general hardening trend.

The Konus-Wind instrument detected this event in the non-trigger mode because of very high background level after strong solar flare (30 times more than normal). Our estimation for energy more than 15 keV is: fluence - 2×  10- 4 erg cm- 2 and peak flux - 2.5×  10- 5 erg cm- 2 s- 1. In spite of rough time resolution in the background mode the Konus-Wind data has evidences of the 5-s pulsations.

Three weak and short bursts are detected at times 2537, 755 and 444 seconds before the giant flare in the WFC unit 1. Their durations are 100, 125 and 55 ms, and their peak fluxes exceed 20 Crab units in 2-28 keV (Feroci et al. 2001b). No gamma-ray counterpart was found for these events in the GRBM, nor in Ulysses or Konus/Wind. This is the first reported bursting activity from SGR 1900+14 since approximately two years.

At the time of the giant flare, as detected by the GRBM, the WFC1 detected a large increase in the count rate for approximately 3 seconds after the GRBM trigger. At this time the count rate was so high (larger than 30,000 counts/s) that it triggered the automatic turn off of the experiment.

BeppoSAX NFI observations

The April 18 2001 activity of SGR 1900+14 allowed us to activate our Target of Opportunity observation program with the BeppoSAX Narrow Field Instruments (NFI, 0.1-300 keV). Thanks to the remarkable effort by the Mission Scientist Team, the Mission Planners Team and our team, the first follow-up observation was started on April 18 at 15:10 UT, less than 8 hours after the event. This first observation (Feroci et al. 2001c) was 28 hours long, for a net exposure time in the MECS instrument of 60 ks. A second pointing was carried out on April 29 at 20:20 UT, for a similar exposure time. The persistent X-ray counterpart of SGR 1900+14 was detected in both observations. The source emitted a large number of short X-ray bursts during the first observation, whereas in the second pointing only one burst was detected.

The average spectrum during the first pointing, after removal of the bursts, can be fit with a power law with photon index 2.6±  0.1 and NH=(4.3±  0.3)[formula] cm- 2. The persistent 2-10 keV flux showed a rapid decaying behaviour during our first pointing, going approximately from 3.5 to 2[formula] erg cm- 2 s- 1 (unabsorbed). Using the X-ray flux in the same band provided by the Chandra observation carried out on April 22 (Kouveliotou et al. 2001), we obtain that the time behaviour of the X-ray flux can be described by a power law, with index ~  -0.6. Interestingly, studying the hardness ratio between the 1.6-4 keV and the 4-10 keV energy ranges, we find a clear correlation flux vs. hardness, indicating that the spectrum softens when the persistent flux decreases.

During our second observation the source appeared to have gone back to its quiescent status. Removing the single burst that we observed, the 0.1-10 keV energy spectrum is best fit by the sum of an absorbed power law plus a blackbody with temperature ~  0.5 keV. The 2-10 keV flux is consistent with the 'standard' quiescent status, at ~  1.1[formula] erg cm- 2 s- 1 (unabsorbed). In Figure 1 we show the plot of the X-ray flux vs. time, including also the Chandra point, that suggests that the source returned to its quiescent status in less than 3 days after the burst.

We performed a period search in both NFI observations and found the expected 5.17-s periodicity in the 2-10 keV flux from the persistent source. In the first observation the best period was 5.17277 s, with a smooth sinusoidal profile. In the second pointing the period increased to 5.17298 s, without significant differences in the pulse profile. Therefore, the period derivative between the two BeppoSAX observation is about 2.3[formula] s s- 1.

Discussion

The BeppoSAX instrumentation observed the most interesting phases of the 2001 activation of SGR 1900+14 with a very complete set of observations. The GRBM and WFC caught the second giant flare in the (observed) history of this source and its precursor X-ray activity. The NFI observed the afterglow of the persistent source after the flare, the bursting activity and its quenching, and the period history soon after the giant flare.

The giant flare is rather unusual with respect to its two predecessors, the March 5 1979 event from SGR 0526-66 and the August 27 1998 flare from SGR 1900+14 (e.g., Mazets et al. 1979, Hurley et al. 1999, Feroci et al. 2001a). The most important differences in the April 18 are in the following aspects:

the peak flux and fluence are more than one order of magnitude smaller

the duration is almost one order of magnitude shorter

there is no evidence for the first short and very hard pulse at the beginning of the event, implying that, contrary to the other two events, most likely there was no relativistic particle emission during this event.

The NFI observation is the fastest pointing after a giant flare and provides a direct observation of a long-duration afterglow emission from an SGR after a giant flare. Our result of an afterglow showing a power law decay, with index -0.6, is similar to that obtained by Woods et al. (2001), who measured a decay index of -0.713±  0.025 after the August 27 event, based on the assumed constancy of the pulsed fraction. Interestingly, Ibrahim et al. (2001) found a similar decay law in the pulsating soft tail of the August 29 short burst.

The spectral variability of the X-ray afterglow is also interesting. During our first observation, at high flux level, the source spectrum showed a softening, and an overall power law shape. In our second observation, at a flux typical of the quiescent state, we clearly detect the emergence of a kT=0.5 keV blackbody component, and an NH smaller by about a factor of 2. Based on our observations, together with our analysis of the previous BeppoSAX observations (see also Woods et al. 1999, 2001) of this source in quiescence (May 1997 and March/April 2000) and after the August 27 giant flare (September 1998), we can state that the blackbody component for this source is peculiar of its quiescent state.
