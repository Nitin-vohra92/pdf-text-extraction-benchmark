Abstract

The Lorentz invariant formalism for description of neutrino flavour oscillations in moving matter is developed. It is shown that the matter motion with relativistic speed can sufficiently change the matter term in the neutrino effective potential. In the case of matter motion parallel to neutrino propagation, matter effects in neutrino flavour oscillations are suppressed. In the case of relativistic motion of matter in the opposite direction in respect to neutrino propagation, sufficient increase of effects of matter in neutrino oscillations is predicted. The effective neutrino flavour oscillation probability, effective mixing angle and oscillation length, as well as the MSW effect resonance condition for the case of moving matter are derived.

The problem of neutrino propagation in matter, starting from the paper of Wolfenstein [\cite=Wol78] is still under intensive study. The most famous result in this field has been received when Mikheev and Smirnov [\cite=MikSmi85] showed that the probability of conversion between different neutrino flavour states can be increased (the MSW effect) due to neutrino interaction with particles of matter if the resonance condition is fulfilled even in the case of very small vacuum mixing angle. Interaction of neutrino with background matter or external electromagnetic fields can also produce modification of neutrino characteristics. For example, under the influence of external environment massless neutrino can acquire an effective mass [\cite=Wel82] and also non-trivial electromagnetic properties [\cite=DOlNiePal89] like non-zero magnetic moment. It is commonly believed that neutrino, propagating through matter and being under the influence of electromagnetic fields might exhibit their properties that under such influence become accessible for experimental observation. That is why we consider below new phenomena in neutrino oscillations that could be produced by motion of matter through which neutrino is propagating.

In a series of papers [\cite=ELSt99] [\cite=ELStpl00] [\cite=ELSt00] we have recently developed the Lorentz invariant formalism for neutrino motion in non-moving and isotropic matter under the influence of an arbitrary configuration of electromagnetic fields. The effective Hamiltonian for the neutrino spin evolution, which accounts not only for the transversal to the neutrino momentum components of electromagnetic field but also for the longitudinal components have been derived. With the using of the proposed Hamiltonian it becomes possible to consider neutrino spin precession in an arbitrary configuration of electromagnetic fields including those that contain strong longitudinal components. We have considered the new types of resonances in the neutrino spin precession νL  ↔  νR that could appear when neutrinos propagate in matter under the influence of different electromagnetic field configurations (see also [\cite=DvoStuYa01]). Within the proposed approach the parametric resonance of neutrino oscillations in electromagnetic wave field with periodically varying time-dependent amplitude and the periodic "castle wall" magnetic field has been also studied [\cite=DSthp0102099].

In the studies [\cite=ELSt99] [\cite=ELStpl00] [\cite=ELSt00] of the neutrino spin evolution we have focused mainly on description of influence of different electromagnetic fields, while modelling the matter we confined ourselves to the most simple case of non-moving and unpolarized matter. In [\cite=LobStuph01] ( see also [\cite=DELSt01]) we have further generalized our approach and developed the covariant description of neutrino oscillations in moving and polarized matter under the influence of electromagnetic fields. The important point is that this approach is valid for accounting of matter motion and polarization for arbitrary speed of matter. It has been shown for the first time that in the case of relativistic motion of matter, the value of effects of matter in neutrino spin (or spin flavour) oscillations sufficiently depends on the direction of matter motion in respect to neutrino propagation and also on the values of matter and neutrino speeds.

It should be also noted here that effects of matter polarization in neutrino oscillations were considered previously in several papers ( see, for example, [\cite=NSSV97] [\cite=BGN99] and references therein). However, the used in refs. [\cite=NSSV97] [\cite=BGN99] procedure of accounting for the matter polarization effect does not enable one to study the case of matter motion with total relativistic speed. Within our approach we can reproduce corresponding results of [\cite=NSSV97] [\cite=BGN99] in the case of matter which is slowly moving or is at rest.

As the main result of our studies [\cite=DELSt01] [\cite=LobStuph01] we have derived the equation for the neutrino spin evolution in electromagnetic field Fμν in moving and polarized matter. Let us now consider neutrino propagation in the relativistic flux of electrons in presence of external magnetic field. In the case the standard model of interaction supplied with SU(2)-singlet right-handed neutrino νR for the evolution equation of the three-dimensional neutrino spin vector [formula] accounting for the direct neutrino interaction with the magnetic field and moving matter (the flux of electrons) it is possible to get [\cite=LobStuph01]

[formula]

where the derivative in the left-hand side of eq.(1) is taken with respect to time t in the laboratory frame, whereas the value [formula] is the magnetic field in the neutrino rest frame given in terms of the transversal in respect to the neutrino motion ([formula]) and longitudinal ([formula]) field components in the laboratory frame,

[formula]

The influence of matter on the neutrino spin evolution in (1) is given by the vector [formula], for which in the case of slowly moving ([formula]) and unpolarized matter we have got

[formula]

where ne is the electron number density, [formula] is the speed of neutrino (γ = (1 - β)- 1 / 2) and

[formula]

Formula ([\ref=3]) reproduces the matter term for the case of neutrino spin oscillations which is similar to the Wolfenstein term [\cite=Wol78] in the neutrino effective potential in the case of flavour oscillations. In the opposite case of relativistic flux of electrons, ve  ~  1, we have found,

[formula]

Here for simplicity we neglect effects of matter polarization (contrary to what has been done in [\cite=LobStuph01]). If we introduce the invariant electron number density,

[formula]

then it follows,

[formula]

Thus, in the case of the parallel motion of neutrinos and electrons of the flux, the matter effect contribution to the neutrino spin evolution equation (1) is suppressed. In the case of neutrino and matter relativistic motion (β and ve  ~  1) in opposite directions, the matter term [formula] gets its maximum value

[formula]

which is equal to the matter term derived for the case of slowly moving (ve  ≪  1) matter times a factor [formula]. Therefore, as it has been predicted in [\cite=LobStuph01] for the neutrino spin and spin flavour oscillations in matter and electromagnetic fields, there can be sufficient increase of matter effects in neutrino oscillations for neutrino propagating against the relativistic flux of matter. On the contrary, the matter effect can be "eaten" by the relativistic motion of matter in the case when matter is moving with relativistic total speed along the direction of neutrino propagation.

As one of our concluding remarks in [\cite=LobStuph01] we have mentioned that the similar matter term suppression (or increase) effect might exist in neutrino flavour oscillation without change of helisity for the case of matter moving with relativistic speed. In this paper we prove this statement . In the frame of the Lorentz invariant approach to description of the neutrino flavour oscillations in matter we get the effective neutrino evolution Hamiltonian which can be used for the case of matter motion with arbitrary ( and also relativistic) total velocities. We show that the matter motion could lead to sufficient change in the neutrino flavour oscillation probabilities and other neutrino oscillation parameters (like the effective mixing angle and oscillation length) if matter is moving with relativistic speed. In particular, in the case of matter moving parallel to the neutrino propagation, the Wolfenstein matter term in the neutrino effective potential is suppressed. Contrary to this suppression effect, in the case of relativistic motion of matter in the opposite direction in respect to neutrino propagation, sufficient increase of effects of matter in neutrino flavour oscillations is predicted. We also argue that effects of matter motion have to be accounted for in the resonance conditions for the neutrino flavour oscillations.

Our goal is to investigate neutrino oscillations characteristics in the case of relativistic motion of matter which can be composed of different background fermions, f = e,n,p,μ,τ etc. In the general case each of the matter components is characterized by its own distribution density function, the number density nf and the speed of the reference frame in which the mean momentum of the fermions f is zero. The fermion f current is determined as

[formula]

If a component of matter f is slowly moving or at rest in the laboratory frame, [formula], the fermion current equals

[formula]

Let us suppose that at least one of the matter components f is moving as a whole with relativistic speed, vf  ≈  1. For simplicity, let us consider neutrino two-flavour oscillations, e.g. νe  ↔  νμ, in matter composed of the only one component, electrons (f = e), moving with relativistic total speed. Generalization for the case of the other types of neutrino conversions and different compositions and types of motion of matter is straight forward.

The matter effect in neutrino oscillations occurs as the result of the elastic forward scattering of neutrinos off the background fermions. In our case the difference ΔV between the mean potentials Ve and Vμ for the two flavour neutrinos is produced by the charged current interaction of the electron neutrino with the background electrons. Note that the neutral current interaction is affective in oscillations between the active and sterile neutrinos. We do not account for effects of matter polarization which vanishes if there is no preferred spin orientation of the electrons. These effects were discussed in details for neutrino flavour oscillations in non-moving matter [\cite=NSSV97] and for neutrino spin oscillations in moving matter [\cite=LobStuph01]. We also neglect the momentum dependence of the charged vector boson propagator. Then the corresponding neutrino effective Lagrangian can be written in the following form (see [\cite=LobStuph01] and also [\cite=Pal92])

[formula]

This additional term in the Lagrangian modifies the Dirac equation:

[formula]

Rearranging the terms we get the neutrino dispersion relation in matter in the following form,

[formula]

The further simplification is found to occur in the limit of weak potential [formula], so we get for the effective energy of the electron neutrino in the moving matter

[formula]

The effective electron neutrino energy in addition to the vacuum energy [formula] contains the Wolfenstein matter term which is proportional to the electron number density ne. Note that there is no matter term in the muon neutrino effective energy in our case. The important new phenomenon, as it can be seen from (14), is the matter term dependence on the speeds of neutrino [formula] and matter [formula], and also on the angle between these two vectors. In the limit of slowly moving matter or matter at rest, vf  ≪  1, we get the usual expression for the matter term which does not depend on the speed of matter.

Now following the usual procedure for the two flavour neutrinos, νe and νμ, with mixing in the high-energy limit it is possible to get the adiabatic solution for the neutrino oscillation problem. Thus, the probability of neutrino conversion νe  →  νμ can be written in the form

[formula]

where the effective mixing angle, θeff, and the effective oscillation length, Leff, in the moving matter are given by

[formula]

[formula]

Here [formula], δm2ν = m22 - m21 is the difference of the neutrino masses squired, [formula] is the neutrino momentum and θ is the vacuum mixing angle.

We can see that the neutrino oscillations characteristics, the probability Pνe  →  νμ(x), the mixing angle θeff and the oscillation length Leff, exhibit the dependence on the motion of matter. The resonance condition

[formula]

at which the above probability has unit amplitude no matter how small the mixing angle θ is, also depends on the motion of matter. Therefore we conclude that the account for the relativistic motion of matter could provide the appearance of the resonance in the neutrino oscillations in certain cases when for the given neutrino characteristics, δm2ν, [formula] and θ, and the invariant matter density at rest, n0, the resonance is impossible.

Let us rewrite the resonance condition ([\ref=res]) in terms of the invariant matter density:

[formula]

The value of n0 gives the matter density in the reference frame for which the total speed of matter is zero. That is why we can say that the effect of matter motion in the resonance condition is described by the factor

[formula]

If one estimates this factor for the ultra-relativistic neutrinos, β  ≈  1, in the case when matter is moving along the direction of the neutrino propagation also with high total speed then

[formula]

In the opposite case, when matter is moving against the direction of the neutrino propagation, one gets

[formula]

From these estimations it follows that: 1) the relativistic motion of matter along the neutrino propagation could provide the resonance increase of the oscillation probability if the matter density n0 is to high for the resonance appearance in non-moving matter, 2) the relativistic motion of matter in opposite direction to the neutrino propagation could provide the resonance increase of the oscillation probability if the matter density n0 is to low for the resonance appearance in non-moving matter.

It worth to be noted that the similar analysis can be performed for any types of the neutrino flavour conversions and different matter composition and that effects of matter polarization can be also easily included [\cite=GriLobStu02]. As it follows from the above consideration, there is an effective decrease (increase) of the matter effect in neutrino oscillations if matter is moving in the direction that is parallel (opposite) to the neutrino propagation. These phenomena have to be accounted in derivation of the resonance conditions for neutrino flavour (and also neutrino spin and spin flavour [\cite=LobStuph01] [\cite=DELSt01]) oscillations in the case when matter is moving with high speed.
