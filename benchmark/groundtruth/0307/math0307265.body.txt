Approximation probabilities, the law of quasistable markets, and phase transitions from the "condensed" state

We consider a discrete set of random variables taking values [formula] with probabilities [formula].

Suppose that a number M is given. This number will be called the (mean) number of tests. We set Pi  =  Mpi, so that [formula].

The concept stated below is developed from an analysis of the quasistable market discussed with V. N. Baturin and S. G. Lebedev, and from an analysis of the market approximation theory developed by B. S. Kashin.

First, as was already noted by the author in his previos works [\cite=Theorver] [\cite=Maslov1] [\cite=Maslov2] [\cite=Maslov3] [\cite=Maslov4], people distinguish the money bonds they have in circulation only by the nomial cost of bonds, but not by their number sign. In other words, although the bonds are, in principle, different (in number signs), in the market and financial problems, it is possible to assume that they are indistinguishable and hence subject to the Bose-Einstein statistics. Thus, from the very beginning, we start from a concept other than that from which the standard theory of probabilities originates.

We are concerned with a stock holder, i.e., with a common person who does not play on rising price and does not risk, but is looking for a direct financial income. We study a quasistatistical market, i.e., a market that varies slowly and is stationary on some time interval.

Example 1.

The depositor has two possibilities: 1) to deposit the money in a single (G1 = 1) pyramid (say, the "MMM" bank);    2) to deposit the money in one G2  >  1 of the common banks with the same bankrate. The depositor has K  1000-rouble bonds. Obviously, the number of possible deposit versions is equal to

[formula]

The total number of versions is

[formula]

We assign the value x1 to the pyramid and the value x2 to banks.

We assume that the average income is [formula], which, in particular, means that x2  ≫  x1, since the income obtained from the pyramid is much larger than that obtained in a bank. Moreover, precisely as in card games, the price of a chip can vary, since, in our situation, it is independent of the bond denomination (it can be a 1000-rouble bond or, e.g., a $100-bond). We denote the denomination of a chip by the letter β, i.e., the gain is equal to [formula]. The important parameter β varies slowly and independently of a common depositor.

We also have the variables G1 and G2 corresponding to x1 and x2, which can also be treated as frequency probabilities.

Hence, according to the standard theory of probabilities, to the values x1 and x2 there correspond the probabilities [formula],  [formula] and the probabilities [formula],  [formula].

If k1, k2, G1, G2 are large, then we can use the Stirling formula and rewrite ([\ref=1'1]) in terms of these two probabilities (see [\cite=Theorver]).

In our example, we have G1 = 1. Moreover, we can have our money not only in 1000-rouble bonds, but in any possible bonds and coins (with accuracy up to a 1 copeck coin). Hence we shall use the approximation formula for the "number" of versions, where we replace the factorials by Γ-functions. Moreover, it is more convenient to consider ln  of the number of versions (the entropy S). In this case, the entropy can be expressed via the sum or, more generally, via the Stieltjes integral.

So there are three measures corresponding to the values x1 and x2.

The depositor aim is to obtain the maximal income [formula]. Hence if there are neither additional taxes nor some additional information, the depositor will invest all the money in the pyramid, i.e.,

[formula]

If the depositor has some additional information (the entropy S) that also takes into account the initial frequency probabilities G1 and G2, then, in the author's oppinion, the following main law of the market takes place, and this is the law the depositor usually obeys in the quasistatistical stock market:

[formula]

This means that the depositor obtains an additional income from the information S.

Definition. The expression

[formula]

will be called the symbol of entropy. As M  →    ∞  andPi  →    ∞  , it follows from the asymptotics of the Γ-function that [formula] as M  →    ∞  , i.e., SM tends to the usual Shannon entropy.

In a more general form, this entropy looks as follows.

We set

[formula]

If [formula] as M  →    ∞  , then we have the limit

[formula]

where H(P,Q) is the relative entropy or the Kullback-Leibler information.

The quasistable market law formulated above is similar to one of the laws in thermodynamics. The latter has not been formulated clearly as a law, but it is constantly used in solving different physical problems. More precisely, the energy to which this principle leads was called by N. N. Bogoliubov an "energetically efficient state."

Recall that energy states or energy levels in quantum mechanics are eigenvalues of some self-adjoint operator called the energy operator. For simplicity, we assume that this operator is a finite-dimensional matrix.

Any eigenvalue is characterized by two characterstics: one is an internal characteristic, i.e., its multiplicity, the other is an external characteristic. If an eigenvalue presents energy levels, then this external characteristic is equal to the number of particles at the energy level (or on the Bohr orbit of an atom). To the measure dP, there corresponds the internal characteristic i.e., the dimension of the subspace corresponding to this particular level which is divided by the dimension of the entire space. To the measure dQ, there corresponds the number of particles staying at this level. Here [formula] is the number of all particles.

An energetically efficient state is a state in which all particles are at the lower level. If the Pauli principle stating that more than two particles cannot be at the same level is taken into account, then the particles must occupy all lower levels.

Thus a similar "efficiency" principle also takes place in the quasistable stock market, but "with a converse accuracy". If the largest value xn of the random variable corresponds to the most profitable stocks, then the buyer will buy all of them. But if each bank has only one stock, then all possible largest values xi will be bought at a rapid pace.

Example 2.

We consider the most trivial game: M persons play the "heads and tails" game with a bank. There are two states ±  1: "heads" means a gain, and "tails" means a loss. Suppose that the players have the right to turn over the coin after it falls out. Then all the players who got "tails" change it for "heads" and get in the highest place in the Bernoulli sequence, although the initial probabilities are the same for each player and the probability that all the players get "heads" is very small.

We have considered the simplest examples of laws of the energetical and the finanicial efficiency.

We have seen that, in addition to the probability measures P and Q, we must introduce one more measure μ  ≪  P such that [formula].

In the previous papers [\cite=Theorver] [\cite=Pidgin], we introduced relative entropies corresponding to the Bose- and Fermi-statistics. They can be generalized to the case in which the numbers of tests are, respectively, equal to M and K as follows:

[formula]

for the Bose-statistics (averaging over the set of stocks close in denomination) and

[formula]

for the Fermi-statistics (if the "rule of queue" takes place).

So the most trivial law of the stock market in the simplest case says that, independently of the initial probabilities P, one must invest all money in the affair that is most profitable at this particular moment. If there are N bonds

[formula]

then all N bonds must be deposited in stocks corresponding to the value xn of random variables.

A similar problem is known in thermodynamics, where the minimum of free energy is considered. The free energy has the form of the expression under the symbol max , where xi are energy levels and Pi is the number of particles at the level xi. This law is less transparent, but more customary. It is universally recognized by physicists and confirmed by numerous experiments.

The formulas given below are also new in thermodynamics, but we present them for the market (i.e., we consider max , but not min ). It follows from the above that these formulas can be trivially written in the language of thermodynamics.

The solution of the equation

[formula]

for Pi can be found from the implicit equation

[formula]

which follows from the well-known formula for the logarithmic derivative of the Γ-function. Under the condition that [formula], for large Pi, this distribution coincides with the Gibbs distribution. We note that the physicists define the Gibbs distribution for integer Pi, but in the final formula, they obtain noninteger Pi.

In the case of a market, the distribution for Bose-statistics follows from the equation

[formula]

and for the Fermi-statistics Pi, it follows from the equation

[formula]

In the thermodynamical case, in these formulas, Gi is the multiplicity of the energy level of a single particle xi, and β = 1 / Θ, where Θ is the inverse temperature. If [formula] and Gi  ≫  1, then the solutions of these equations in the boson case have the form

[formula]

and in the fermion case, they have the form

[formula]

In the thermodynamical case, the distributions are determined from the minimum of the expression

[formula]

which is called the free energy. Here S is the entropy. In the boson case, the entropy has the form

[formula]

and in the fermion case, it has the form

[formula]

We shall consider the following financial model. A depositor has some money, say, N, which he can put either in the "MMM" bank or in G equal "strong" banks. We assume that the "MMM" bank gives the income βλ1 per unit deposit, while "strong" banks give the income βλ2 per unit deposit, where λ2  <  λ1 and β is a positive parameter describing variations in the bankrate. Further, we assume that the deposit to "strong" banks is equal to k, and the deposit to the "MMM" bank is, respectively, equal to N - k. Then the income received by the depositor is equal to

[formula]

Obviously, if there are no additional sources of income, it is more profitable to put all the money in the "MMM" bank. Deposits to "strong" banks can be done in many ways. We assume that this is related to some additional infromation obtained by the depositor. We also assume that any additional information gives some additional income equal to the logarithm of the information amount. Next, we consider the case in which the information amount is determined by means of the Boltzmann statistics formula, but here, in view of Example 1, we consider the case in which the information amount is determined by the Bose-Einstein statistics:

[formula]

where Γ(x) is the Euler gamma function. In this case, the income given by "strong" banks for the deposit k is equal to

[formula]

Now we study the problem of how to obtain the maximal income. Obviously, for this, it is necessary to find the maximum of function ([\ref=4]) on the interval k∈[0,N].

There exists a critical value βc of the parameter β. If β  <  βc, then function ([\ref=4]) attains its maximum at k = N. This means that if all banks give low incomes, then it is most profitable to deposit to "strong" banks. The critical value is given by the formula

[formula]

where Ψ(x) = Γ'(x) / Γ(x) is the derivative of the logarithm of the gamma function. There exists one more critical value β0  >  βc of the parameter β such that, for β  >  β0, function ([\ref=4]) has maximum at k = 0. This means that, for high incomes, it is most profitable to give all the money to the "MMM" bank. This critical value is given by the formula

[formula]

If the parameter β lies in the interval
