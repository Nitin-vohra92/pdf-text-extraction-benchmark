Introduction

Our purpose of this paper is to apply a method developed in this one to Quantum Computation. Quantum Computation (or Computer) is a challenging task in this century for not only physicists but also mathematicians. See for example [\cite=LPS] as a general introduction.

Quantum Computation is in a usual understanding based on qubits which are based on two level system (two energy levels or fundamental spins of atoms), See [\cite=AE], [\cite=MSIII], [\cite=BR], [\cite=C-HDG] as for general theory of two level system. In a realistic image of Quantum Computer we need at least one hundred atoms. However then we meet a very severe problem called Decoherence which will destroy a superposition of quantum states in the process of unitary evolution of our system. See for example [\cite=WHZ] or recent [\cite=MFr3] as an introduction. At the present it is not easy to control Decoherence.

By the way, an atom has in general infinitely many energy levels, while in a qubit method we use only two energy levels. We should use this possibility to reduce a number of atoms. We use n energy levels from the ground state (it is not realistic to take all energy levels into consideration at the same time). We call this n level system a qudit theory, see for example [\cite=KF3], [\cite=KF6], [\cite=KuF].

In a qubit case we need Rabi oscillations to construct quantum logic gates. See [\cite=KF1] as a simple introduction to quantum logic gates. Similarly we also need Rabi oscillations to construct them in a qudit space. However a general theory of Rabi oscillations in a n level system has not been developed enough as far as we know. For three level system see [\cite=MSIII], [\cite=BR] and [\cite=MFr5]. Therefore we attempt such a theory in this paper.

In this model we assume the rotating wave approximation (RWA) from the beginning, otherwise we cannot solve the model. However there is no problem on the approximation in the weak coupling regime (the coupling constant is small enough compared to the energy differences of an atom). We note that there is a problem to use this approximation in the strong coupling regime.

Before stating our result let us make a review of Rabi oscillations (or coherent oscillations) in a two level system. For a quantum version of the Rabi oscillation see for example, [\cite=C-HDG], [\cite=MFr2], [\cite=KF2].

Let {σ1,σ2,σ3} be Pauli matrices :

[formula]

and we set

[formula]

Let us consider an atom with 2 energy levels E0 and E1 ( E1  >  E0). Its Hamiltonian is in the diagonal form given as

[formula]

This is rewritten as

[formula]

where Δ = E1 - E0 is an energy difference. Since we usually take no interest in constant terms, we can set

[formula]

We consider an atom with two energy levels which interacts with external (periodic) field with g(ωt + φ). In the following we set [formula] for simplicity. The Hamiltonian in the dipole approximation is given by

[formula]

where ω is the frequency of the external field, g the coupling constant between the external field and the atom. This model is complicated enough, see [\cite=MFr1], [\cite=MFr4], [\cite=KF5], [\cite=BaWr], [\cite=SGD].

In the following we set φ = 0 for simplicity and assume the rotating wave approximation (which neglects the fast oscillating terms), namely

[formula]

and

[formula]

therefore the Hamiltonian is given by

[formula]

by the redefinition of g (g / 2  →  g). It is explicitly

[formula]

We would like to solve the Schrödinger equation

[formula]

For that let us decompose H in ([\ref=eq:reduction-matrix]) into

[formula]

so if we set

[formula]

then it is not difficult to see

[formula]

which is easily solved. For simplicity we set the resonance condition

[formula]

then the solution of ([\ref=eq:schrodinger-equation-2]) is

[formula]

As a result, the solution of the equation ([\ref=eq:schrodinger-equation]) is given as

[formula]

by ([\ref=eq:transformation]). If we choose [formula] as an initial condition, then

[formula]

This is a well-known model of the Rabi oscillation (or coherent oscillation).

N Level System [formula] General Theory

In general, an atom has an infinitely many energy levels, however it is not realistic to consider all of them at the same time. Therefore we take only n energy levels from the ground state into consideration ([formula]). Then from the lesson in the preceding section the energy Hamiltonian can be written as

[formula]

where Δj = Ej - E0 for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1. For this atom we consider the interaction with n(n - 1) / 2 independent external (laser) fields corresponding to every energy difference (Ej - Ei for j  >  i). Then the interaction term assuming the RWA from the beginning is given as

[formula]

so the full Hamiltonian is

[formula]

where g is the coupling constant. Here we set

[formula]

for simplicity. We would like to solve the Schrödinger equation

[formula]

Similarly in ([\ref=eq:decomposition]) let us decompose H : For

[formula]

it is easy to see

[formula]

where

[formula]

for j - i  ≥  2.

By setting

[formula]

it is not difficult to see

[formula]

where

[formula]

At this stage we set the resonance conditions

[formula]

to make the situation simpler. Therefore H̃U can be written as

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore the Schrödinger equation becomes

[formula]

Now it is easy to solve

[formula]

which solution is

[formula]

By making use of the method of constant variation

[formula]

and substituting this into ([\ref=eq:schrodinger-perturbation]) we have the equation

[formula]

For this equation a formal solution called the Dyson series has been known

[formula]

However it is usually almost impossible to perform integrals. Anyway, our formal solution of the equation ([\ref=eq:second-schrodinger-equation]) becomes

[formula]

where Ψ is a constant vector. As a conclusion, a formal solution of ([\ref=eq:schrodinger-equation-general]) is given by

[formula]

with U(t) in ([\ref=eq:U]).

Lastly let us calculate ( - igtC) in ([\ref=eq:full-formal-solution]). For that purpose we need to make C in ([\ref=eq:semi-diagonal]) a diagonal form. First let us calculate eigenvalues. The characteristic equation of C is

[formula]

By the Laplace expansion with respect to the first column we have a recurrent equation

[formula]

For example, f4(λ) = λ4 - 3λ2 + 1 . From these equations it is not easy to conjecture the eigenvalues. However we know a good method ! We set

[formula]

Then for example,

[formula]

In general

[formula]

The solutions of fn(x) = 0 are [formula] ([formula]) because x  ≠    ±  1. Therefore our solutions are

[formula]

by removing the overlap.

Next let us calculate an eigenfunction corresponding to λj

[formula]

for [formula]. If we define

[formula]

then it is not difficult to see

[formula]

We leave the proof to the readers. Now we define

[formula]

and

[formula]

then we can diagonalize C like

[formula]

Therefore we finally obtain

[formula]

or in components

[formula]

In the case of n = 3 let us write down ( - igtC) explicitly for the sake of latter convenience.

[formula]

For ([\ref=eq:n=n]) with ([\ref=eq:n=n_components]) we would like to calculate the Dyson series ([\ref=eq:dyson-series]). However it is almost impossible in the general case, so in the last section we calculate the next-leading term in the case of n = 3 by making use of ([\ref=eq:n=3]).

N Level System [formula] An Exact Solution

In this section we present an exact solution in the general case under some "consistency condition" (in our terminology).

In section 2 we consider a very special case : namely, in ([\ref=eq:non-diagonal]) we take

[formula]

for all j - i  ≥  2. We call this a consistency condition. Then H̃U becomes a constant matrix !

[formula]

so it is easy to solve the equation ([\ref=eq:schrodinger-perturbation])

[formula]

The solution is formally

[formula]

Let us calculate ( - igtQ) explicitly. If we define

[formula]

then it is easy to see [formula], so

[formula]

Since [formula],

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Therefore we obtain

[formula]

Here if we choose [formula], then

[formula]

As a result, the solution that is looking for is just

[formula]

with ([\ref=eq:U]). In particular, in the case of n = 3 the solution is

[formula]

Three Level System [formula] An Approximate Solution

We calculate the case of n = 3 in more detail. For that purpose let us list [formula], ( - igtC) and R(t) once more :

[formula]

and

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] for simplicity.

First of all we must calculate A(t) in ([\ref=eq:A(t)]). This calculation is tedious even in the case of n = 3. The result is

[formula]

where

[formula]

Next we must calculate the Dyson series ([\ref=eq:dyson-series]) with A(t) above. To calculate all terms in ([\ref=eq:dyson-series]) is of course impossible, so we calculate up to the next-leading term :

[formula]

with φ(0) being the ground state φ(0) = (1,0,0)T. By the way, it is convenient for us to calculate

[formula]

rather than ([\ref=eq:approx]) itself. The result is

[formula]

where

[formula]

We leave the check of this calculation to the readers.

As a result we obtain the approximate solution (up to the next-leading) in the case of n = 3

[formula]

with x1(t),x2(t),x3(t) above. This is our main result.

Discussion

In this paper we developed a general theory of the n level system by assuming the rotating wave approximation and gave an analytical solution under the "consistency condition". Moreover in the three level system we gave some approximate solution (up to the next-leading term), which may be enough because we are treating the weak coupling regime (g is small enough compared to the energy differences of the atom). To continue further calculations (higher order corrections) is not easy at the present.

Here we state our motivation once more. In Quantum Computation with three level system we must first of all construct or approximate all elements in U(3) by making use of (a kind of) Rabi oscillations [formula] a universality of one qudit theory. This is not an easy problem. In fact, in almost all papers in qudit theory this has not been mentioned as far as we know. Our paper is an attempt to this problem and we gave the approximate solutions ([\ref=eq:approximate-solution]). We need a furthermore study.

We list the equation in the three level system once more

[formula]

and present

Problem  Show a good method to solve (or to solve approximately) the equation above.

This problem seems to be very hard.

Moreover, study the general equation in the three level system (without the rotating wave approximation)

[formula]

This is our next target !
