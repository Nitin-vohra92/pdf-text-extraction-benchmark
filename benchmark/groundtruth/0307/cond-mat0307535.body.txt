No dinosaurs in microcanonical gravitation: No special "microcanonical phase transitions"

In a recent paper Bouchet and Barré[\cite=bouchet03] introduced a special class of "microcanonical" phase transitions. These are defined by singularities of the microcanonical entropy or the microcanonical temperature. However, such singularities do not exist in the microcanonical thermodynamics, i.e. of a system at equilibrium, based on Boltzmann's principle [\cite=gross174] neither for small systems nor for the real large self-gravitating astrophysical ones.

as also the temperature

are single valued, smooth, and multiple differentiable for any finite N. Here W(E) is the (6N - 1) folded integral which measures the geometric area of the microcanonical many-fold of points with the energy E in the 6N-dim. phase space. T(E) is a single valued differentiable function at all energies as long as β > 0, i.e. E is finite. This clearly excludes all microcanonical "hysteretic cyclings", -zones, or "dinosaur's necks" as introduced by [\cite=chavanis02b].

Chavanis argues in private communication that the "hysteretic cycles" reflect possible meta-stable configurations which are important in astro-physics. This might well be so but is outside of any controllable and fundamental conception of statistics. The microcanonical ensemble E is per definition the ensemble of all possible configuration in the 6N-dim phasespace with the same energy. Its geometrical size is W = eS(E). Of course it is interesting and important to consider only those configurations [formula] which represent e.g. stars at densities up to the ignition of their hydrogen burning, when further gravitational collapse is halted for a while. This can be done by adding an upper limit to the local density as done e.g by ref. [\cite=gross187] [\cite=gross195] [\cite=gross200]. M(E) is then still a compact manifold and similarly single valued multiple differentiable in E. Again there are no singularities and no "dinosaurs".
