A Kähler structure on the punctured cotangent bundle of the Cayley projective plane

Introduction

In the paper [\cite=Ra1] a Kähler structure on the punctured cotangent bundle T*0Sn = [formula] of the sphere Sn is constructed through the mapping τS

[formula]

It is shown that the natural symplectic form ω = ωS on the cotangent bundle coincides with the Kähler form [formula](see also [\cite=So]). Moreover the geodesic flow action is holomorphic.

In the paper [\cite=FT] we constructed a Kähler structure on the punctured cotangent bundle of complex and quaternion projective spaces with similar properties as for the sphere cases(see also [\cite=Ii2]). This Kähler structure is just a positive complex polarization on the cotangent bundle as a symplectic manifold and is applied to construct a quantization operator by the method of pairing of polarizations. The operator quantizes geodesic flows of such manifolds. In other words such an operator gives a correspondence between the geodesic flow and the one parameter group of Fourier integral operators generated by the square root of the Laplacian([\cite=FY], [\cite=Ra2]).

In this paper we construct a Kähler structure on the punctured cotangent bundle of the Cayley projective plane whose Kähler form coincides with the natural symplectic form on the cotangent bundle and is invariant under the action of the geodesic flow (Theorem 2.1).

In general it will not be easy to find such Riemannian manifolds whose (punctured)cotangent bundle has a Kähler structure where the symplectic form coincides with the Kähler form and is invariant under the action of the geodesic flow (see [\cite=Sz1] and [\cite=Sz2]). Such a Kähler structure for complex and quaternion projective spaces is constructed by making use of the Hopf fibration and the map above for the sphere. Although the Cayley projective plane has no fiber bundle like the Hopf fiber bundle, we prove here that a map similar to the cases of complex and quaternion projective spaces gives an embedding of the punctured cotangent bundle of the Cayley projective plane into the space of a complexified exceptional Jordan algebra. It is well-known that the Cayley projective plane is one of the compact symmetric spaces of rank one and that the exceptional Lie group F4 acts on it two-point homogeneously. Some properties which we prove in Theorem 2.1 could be shown quite easily if we used this property of minimal rank for symmetric spaces, but we prove our main theorem through elementary calculi in a Jordan algebra where the Cayley projective plane is realized as a subset consisting of primitive idempotents. Further we give an embedding of this image in the complexified exceptional Jordan algebra into the space of 8  ×  8 complex matrices by composing with a map given by [\cite=Y].

In §1 we describe the Cayley projective plane as a subset consisting of primitive idempotents in an exceptional Jordan algebra. In §2 we state our main theorem and a corollary. In §3 we recall some basic facts about the Jordan algebra including, so called, the Freudenthal product and the determinant on the Jodran algebra. In §4 we prove our main theorem and in §5 we describe an embedding of the punctured cotangent bundle of the Cayley projective plane into the space of 8  ×  8 complex matrices.

Cayley projective plane

In this section we describe the Cayley projective plane as a subset in the exceptional Jordan algebra over the real number field [formula](see [\cite=M] and [\cite=Be]).

Let [formula] be the quaternion number field, that is, [formula] is an algebra over [formula] generated by [formula] with the relations:

[formula]

The Cayley number field O is a division algebra over [formula] generated by [formula] with [formula] given by the table

[formula]

Especially,

[formula]

Hence O is identified with

[formula]

and the multiplication between [formula] and [formula] [formula] is given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula], and so on. We assume that the basis [formula] are orthonormal and we will sometimes omit [formula] (= identity element) and identify [formula].

For [formula], we denote

[formula]

as for [formula].

Let M(3,O) be the space of 3  ×  3 matrices with entries in O. By identifying [formula], we denote for X∈M(3,O)

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula].

Now consider the subspace [formula] in M(3,O) defined by

[formula]

then [formula] and any [formula] has the form where [formula], xi∈O.

The space [formula] is called an exceptional Jordan algebra with the Jordan product

[formula]

[formula].

[formula] has an inner product given by

[formula]

In fact, for [formula], we have [formula], and

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula] denote the inner product on O.

Now the Cayley projective plane P2O is defined as

[formula].

The exceptional Lie group F4 is defined as a group of algebra automorphisms of [formula], and acts on P2O two-point homogeneously. So we have [formula], where [formula] is realized as a subgroup of F4 consisting of those elements which leave [formula] invariant.

A Kähler structure

In this section we describe a Kähler structure on the punctured cotangent bundle T*0P2O = [formula] and state our main Theorem 2.1.

The tangent bundle TP2O is identified with the subset in [formula] as

[formula]

We introduce the Riemannian metric on P2O such that

[formula]

where (X,Y1), (X,Y2) ∈ TP2O.

Then from the inclusions [formula] ⊂   [formula] ⊂   O, the complex projective plane [formula] and the quaternion projective plane [formula] are embedded isometrically into P2O as totally geodesic submanifolds ([\cite=Be]).

In the following we identify the tangent bundle TP2O and the cotangent bundle T*P2O through the metric above. Under this identification the symplectic form ωO on T*P2O is given by

[formula]

where we should interpret the inner product (dX,dY) as a two-form in such a way that

[formula]

restricted to TP2O, that is, we notice that [formula] is replaced by [formula] and so on in the definition of the inner product on [formula]

We can extend [formula], and the inner product (  ·  ,  ·  ) to the complexification [formula] in a natural way. So the Hermite inner product 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 on [formula] is given by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula] is the complex conjugate of Xα. The norm of these elements in [formula] and [formula] is always written as [formula], and we write the norm of the tangent vector Y∈TX(P2O) by [formula].

Now consider the map [formula] defined by

[formula]

then we have

The map τO gives an isomorphism between T*0P2O and [formula]. Moreover

[formula]

The two-form [formula] is itself a Kähler form on [formula], so that we can regard [formula] is a symplectic manifold. On this symplectic manifold the flow [formula] defined by is a Hamilton flow. The Hamiltonian of this flow is given by the function [formula]. Since [formula] is holomorphic and the flow {φt} leaves [formula] invariant, the Hamiltonian of this flow on [formula] is just the restriction of f to [formula], that is, the Hamiltonian is the square root of the metric function. So the flow {φt} is the bicharacteristic flow of the square root of the Laplacian on P2O. Especially the flow restricted to the unit sphere = [formula] coincides with the geodesic flow. So we have

The geodesics γ(t) on P2O through a point X with the direction Y ([formula] and [formula]) is given by

[formula]

Freudenthal product and determinant

In this section we recall several formulas in the Jordan algebra [formula] for later use(see [\cite=M]).

Let [formula], then the "Freudenthal product" X  ×  Y ∈ [formula] is defined by the formula

[formula]

where [formula] and the determinant,"det X", for X ∈ [formula] is defined by

[formula]

Then we have

[formula], for [formula] ∈ [formula]

[formula]()

(X  ×  X)  ×  (X  ×  X) =  det X  ·  X.

As we explained above

[formula]

Now F4 is also given in the following ways:

[formula]

We also have for g∈F4

[formula]

The "Freudenthal product" and "det " on [formula] are extended naturally to the complexification [formula], and we denote them with the same notations. Then the complexification of F4 is defined in the same way:

The complex simple Lie group [formula] is

[formula]

The two-point homogeneity of F4 on P2O is equivalent to

Let [formula], then F4 acts on S(P2O) transitively and we have

[formula]

where the stationary subgroup at the point [formula] ∈ S(P2O) is identified with [formula].

The representation of [formula] on [formula](=[formula]) is irreducible, and the subspace [formula] is the orbit of the highest weight vector. According to the theorem by Lichtenstein([\cite=Li]), then such an orbit is characterized as the null set of a certain system of quadric equations. Thus our equation [formula] (also this is equivalent to A  ×  A = 0 and [formula]) is nothing else than an example of this theorem in [\cite=Li], however we need the map τO to put a Kähler structure on T*0P2O.

Proof of the theorem

We give a proof of Theorem 2.1 in a series of lemmas and proposition.

First we prove

Let (X,Y)∈TP2O, then

det X = 0,

[formula],

det Y = 0.

Since

[formula]

we have by the definition of the determinant

From the equality we have

[formula]

Hence [formula].

Since [formula], the Freudenthal product Y  ×  Y is expressed as and we have

[formula]

Then by taking the trace we have Now

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

For (X,Y)∈T0P2O, [formula], that is, [formula].

Let X,Y∈T0P2O, then

[formula]

Here we notice the following formulas: let (X,Y)∈T(P2O), then

[formula],

[formula],

det (X  ±  Y)  =  0,

[formula].

(i) is obtained by the Cayley-Hamilton and (ii) is easily shown. (iii) and (iv) are proved by first calculating

[formula]

and by taking trace of both sides, we know det (X  ±  Y)  =  0. Hence we have also (iv).

Next, from the formula (Y  ×  Y)  ×  (Y  ×  Y) = ( det Y)Y = 0 we have and so we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally by making use of these formulas we can prove

[formula]

Let a map [formula] be

[formula]

where X and Y are given by the following formulas:

[formula]

Let X,Y be defined as above for [formula], then

[formula], [formula], [formula]

[formula], [formula].

By the definition of the Freudenthal product we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

So we have

[formula]

and then we have

[formula]

It follows easily that [formula] because of [formula] and [formula].

Put [formula] ∈ [formula], where [formula]. Now we can assume [formula], because of the homogeneity of the map σ. Then we have [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Also we show

[formula]

The last equalities are proved by the following argument: from the equalities [formula] and [formula], we have Then

[formula]

Hence we have On the other hand

[formula]

Note that the last equality shows that [\eqref=eq:x1] does not depend on the sign. Hence So we have since [formula] and

[formula]

Then these finally imply

[formula]

By making use of these formulas we prove [formula]. Again we may assume [formula], then X is written as

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

where we used the equality

Also we have [formula].

Next we show Since

[formula]

From these we have proved that τO is a bijection between T*0P2O in [formula] and [formula] in [formula] and that σ is the inverse map.

Next we prove [formula], that is, the Kähler form [formula] coincides with the symplectic form ωO on T*0P2O.

First we have

[formula]

Here we should consider [formula] to be the section

[formula]

of the trivial bundle [formula] on [formula], and dA the section of [formula]. Note that the inner product (  ·  ,  ·  ) defines the pairing [formula] →   [formula]. In the calculations below we will use this pairing with the same notation (  ·  ,  ·  ). Also we note [formula] under the mapping τO.

We write

[formula]

where a = a(X,Y),b = b(X,Y). Then

[formula]

Now from we have

[formula]

So the real part of is a closed form, since [formula]. From

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

By the equality [formula] we have and by [formula], we have Hence we finally proved

[formula]

The map τO commutes with the actions of F4 on T0P2O and on [formula] (as a subgroup in [formula]. Of course all the elements in F4 preserve the symplectic form ωO. Then it will be true that the subgroup of [formula] consisting of those elements that preserve the symplectic form ωO is compact. Hence it will coincide with F4.

An embedding into [formula]

In this section we describe an embedding of the space [formula] into the space of 8  ×  8 complex matrices [formula].

By identifying [formula], we define γ:  O  →  O by

[formula]

The map γ is naturally extended to the complexification [formula], where we regard [formula]. It is easily verified that γ is an algebra isomorphism of O (and of [formula]), that is, γ∈G2([formula] the group of algebra isomorphisms of O), [formula], and [formula].

Let [formula] be [formula], and we denote by

[formula]

then

[formula]

is also an algebra isomorphism.

We decompose elements [formula] as

[formula]

where [formula]. Then we can regard Here we denote by [formula] the Jordan algebra of 3  ×  3 Hermitian matrices with entries in [formula].

Now we define a map g following [\cite=Y]:

[formula]

where we denote by [formula] the subspace in the Jordan algebra [formula] consisting of elements whose trace is zero.

The map g satisfies

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We remark that [formula] for [formula] defines a Euclidean inner product on [formula]. We extend it to the complexification [formula].

If [formula], then from (i) above we have at once

[formula]

Let [formula] be the isomorphism given by

[formula]

and we denote with the same notation ρ the map

[formula]

where [formula].

[formula]

where

Let [formula] and [formula], then as we know ρ(g(A))2 is a scalar matrix and [formula]. Conversely we have

Let [formula], and [formula], then there exists an element [formula] such that

[formula]

under the condition that A is of the form

[formula]

The canonical line bundle of this complex structure on T*0P2O will be holomorphically trivial and this realization of T*0P2O in the space [formula] given in the above proposition will be useful to construct an explicit holomorphic trivialization of the canonical line bundle.
