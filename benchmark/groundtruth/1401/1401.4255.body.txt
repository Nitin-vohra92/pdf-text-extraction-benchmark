An explicit formula for Bernoulli numbers in terms of Stirling numbers of the second kind

Introduction

It is well known that Bernoulli numbers Bk for [formula] may be generated by

[formula]

See [\cite=Comtet-Combinatorics-74]. In combinatorics, Stirling numbers S(n,k) of the second kind for [formula] may be computed by

[formula]

and may be generated by

[formula]

See [\cite=Comtet-Combinatorics-74]. Bell polynomials [formula] of the second kind are defined by

[formula]

for [formula], see [\cite=Comtet-Combinatorics-74].

The aim of this note is to find an explicit formula for computing Bernoulli numbers Bn in terms of Stirling numbers S(n,k) of the second kind.

The main results may be summarized as the following theorem.

For [formula], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Bernoulli-Stirling-thm]

In combinatorics, Faà di Bruno formula may be described in terms of the second kind Bell polynomials [formula] by

[formula]

See [\cite=Comtet-Combinatorics-74]. It is easy to see that Applying in [\eqref=Bruno-Bell-Polynomial] the functions [formula] and [formula] results in

[formula]

On the other hand, differentiating n times on both sides of [\eqref=Bernumber-dfn] leads to As a result, we obtain

[formula]

In [\cite=Comtet-Combinatorics-74], it was listed that

[formula]

Letting x1 = 0 and xm = 1 for [formula] in [\eqref=113-final-formula] and employing [\eqref=2stirling-gen-funct-exp] give This implies that

[formula]

The formula [\eqref=B-S-0-1-value] follows.

By virtue of

[formula]

see [\cite=Comtet-Combinatorics-74], and the formula [\eqref=B-S-0-1-value], we obtain

[formula]

from which, the formula [\eqref=B-S-frac-value] follows.

Substituting [\eqref=B-S-frac-value] into [\eqref=Bernoulli-Bell-formula] leads to which may be rewritten as the formula [\eqref=Bernoulli-Stirling-formula]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=Bernoulli-Stirling-thm] is complete.

Remarks

The formula [\eqref=B-S-frac-value] may be alternatively proved as follows.

Taking [formula] for all [formula] in [\eqref=113-final-formula] and utilizing [\eqref=2stirling-gen-funct-exp] yield This implies that The formula [\eqref=B-S-frac-value] follows.

We collect several formulas for computing Bernoulli numbers Bn as follows.

In [\cite=Logan-Bell-87], see also [\cite=GKP-Concrete-Math], the following explicit formula for computing Bernoulli numbers Bn in terms of the second kind Stirling numbers S(n,k) was presented: For [formula], we have

[formula]

In [\cite=recursion], among other things, it was found that, for k  ≥  1,

[formula]

where Am is defined by In [\cite=exp-derivative-sum-Combined.tex], it was presented that Bernoulli numbers B2k may be computed by

[formula]

In [\cite=Tan-Cot-Bernulli-No.tex], among other things, it was discovered that, for [formula],

[formula]
