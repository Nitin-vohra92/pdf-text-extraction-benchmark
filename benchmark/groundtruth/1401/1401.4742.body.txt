Early Type Galaxy Core Phase Densities

INTRODUCTION

Early type galaxies, ellipticals and S0s, form an impressively regular sequence with luminosity, as seen in the Faber-Jackson relation [\citep=FJ:76] and generalized in the fundamental plane relations [\citep=DD:87] [\citep=BM:98]. The core radius and brightness are basic observational properties which hold clues to the origin of the early type galaxies. Galaxy merging, star-formation, the presence of black holes and, in sufficiently dense cores, dynamical friction and two-body relaxation, all play some role in creating the cores. One widely considered possibility for the formation and evolution of early type galaxy cores is that they are largely a result of stellar dynamical processes in the core with gas and star formation playing minor roles.

The coarse grain phase space density can be defined as [formula] Q0 is a key dynamical quantity to assess the relative roles of various stellar dynamical processes. The local phase density controls the rate of two-body relaxation and dynamical friction, along with the masses of the orbiting bodies [\citep=BT:08]. Liouville's theorem [\citep=Goldstein:02] requires that the fine grain phase density, F, is a constant of the motion in a conservative Hamiltonian system, with the coarse grain phase density required to be Q  ≤  F (with appropriate velocity space normalization).

The observational description of the central surface brightness distribution of early type galaxies began with ground-based telescope data and used the physically well motivated King model [\citep=King:62] [\citep=King:66] [\citep=King:78]. CCDs observations showed that some early type galaxies, particularly those with lower luminosities, had central brightness distributions that rose above the constant brightness King model core [\citep=Kormendy:85] [\citep=Lauer:85] although earlier photographic data had noted this as indicating the presence of a stellar nucleus [\citep=Binggeli:84]. The angular resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope showed that what became known as power-law cores were increasingly common with decreasing galaxy luminosity. [\citep=Crane:93] [\citep=Ferrarese:94] [\citep=Kormendy:94].

The central density profiles of early type galaxies are classified as being a power-law, if the negative logarithmic slope is greater than 0.5, or, cored, if the slope is shallower than 0.3 [\citep=Gebhardt:96] [\citep=Ravindranath:01] [\citep=Rest:01] [\citep=Lauer:07b]. However, the core parameters and the degree of bimodality of the central slope distribution depend on the surface brightness fitting model and the sample definition.

The purpose of this paper is to calculate the phase density of spheroidal systems, focusing on early type galaxies, to consider its correlations with core properties. In particular we examine to what degree phase density relates to the suggestions that early type cores have a bimodal distribution in their brightness profile slopes. These relations are considered as tests of stellar dynamical models for the formation and evolution of early type galaxy cores.

The Observational Data

There are two leading functional forms to fit a general core brightness profile. The Nuker formula [\citep=Lauer:95] [\citep=Carollo:97] [\citep=Lauer:07b] is designed to describe the central region of a galaxy and does not need data at large radii, which is often convenient if there is limited observational coverage. An alternate, whole galaxy, brightness profile fitting approach is the core-Sérsic function [\citep=GG:03] [\citep=Graham:03] [\citep=Trujillo:04] [\citep=Ferrarese:06] [\citep=Turner:12] [\citep=Dullo:12]. The core-Sérsic function provides good fits to the entire brightness profile of a galaxy at the relatively small cost of a single extra parameter. There are significant differences of detail between the two approaches and no clear consensus on best approach has emerged.

The slope of the brightness profile at the smallest practical radius of observation, 0.1 arcsec , defines the parameter [formula] of the Nuker approach. The angular definition introduces a direct distance dependence in the measurement. The Nuker [formula] is general agreement with the core-Sérsic measurement of the comparable quantity, although with some scatter and a systematic offset [\citep=Dullo:12]. The fitted break radius of the Nuker profile has limitations in describing the core radius [\citep=Carollo:97] which led to the development of a transformed quantity, rγ, the radius at which the Nuker fit has a slope of 0.5, as the best measure of the core radius. [\citet=Dullo:12] show that the core-Sérsic break radius, rb,cS, is in good agreement with the Nuker rγ.

Defining a representative sample of early type galaxies is important when comparing trends within a population. The [\citet=Lauer:07b] sample is the largest available compilation and is approximately magnitude limited. A very wide ranging set of kinematic and dynamical data are available for the ATLAS3D [\citet=Cappellari:11] sample, which is designed to be a complete volume limited sample. Both samples report Nuker profile fit parameters and serve as two large, comparable and complementary samples for our analysis.

Phase Density Calculation

To calculate the core coarse grain phase space density requires measurements of the core velocity dispersion and core radius, from which other quantities can be derived. The different types of systems have a range of density profiles and somewhat different approaches to measurement are used, meaning that the phase densities will have small systematic differences between them although we expect these to much smaller than the large range of Q0 values present. To obtain a physical mass density in the core we use the King radius relation [\citep=BT:08] of an non-singular isothermal sphere for all systems,

[formula]

We recognize that few of the systems are particularly well described as an isotropic isothermal sphere, however Equation [\ref=eq_rhoc] provides a uniform basis to calculate basis that will be correct within a factor of a few. To employ Equation [\ref=eq_rhoc] we need to identify a central velocity dispersion and a measure of the core radius for the systems that we consider. Although our primary interest is the early type galaxies, in which core radii are measured in the same way, we will make comparisons to phase densities of nuclear star clusters of late type galaxies and globular clusters in which the measures of core radius are comparable but not identical, which will lead to systematic differences, but these will not affect our limited use.

Given our assumptions,

[formula]

for σ0 in units of [formula] and rc in units of pc. Q0 is the approximate phase space density at the core radius and normally increases inward from that location.

Early type Galaxies

The [\citet=Lauer:07a] [\citet=Lauer:07b] sample is a large compilation of available HST data, but as an approximately apparent magnitude limited sample contains more luminous galaxies than a volume limited sample [\citep=Lauer:07b] [\citep=Cote:07]. In total there are 189 galaxies in the sample that have core profiles and central velocity dispersions.

The ATLAS3D sample [\citep=Krajnovic:13] is constructed to be essentially a complete sample of galaxies more massive than about [formula] within 42 Mpc. [\citet=Krajnovic:13] provides Nuker fits for the surface brightness profiles. We remove galaxies with upper limits for rγ from the sample, which reduces the numbers to 74. We equate rγ with rc below. For the ATLAS3D sample we use the values of velocity dispersion at Re / 8 as tabulated in [\citet=Cappellari:13XX].

For all early type galaxies we calculate the core mass from the projected quantities, using the relationship Σ0 = 2ρ0rc,

[formula]

This integrates to [formula].

Density profiles are classified as being cored if [formula] (red in plots) and power-law if [formula] (blue in plots), with an intermediate type between (magenta in plots) [\citep=Lauer:07b].

Globular clusters

Globular clusters may play a significant role in the formation of galactic cores [\citep=TOS:75]. Accordingly it is interesting to understand where their phase densities fits into the overall sequence [\citep=Walcher:05]. In this work we will assume that the Milky Way globular clusters are representative of the group as a whole. For these clusters, core radii and central velocity dispersions come from the 2010 edition of the compilation of [\citet=Harris:96]. In the following figures globular cluster data are plotted as solid black dots.

We use Equation [\ref=eq_rhoc] to calculate the core density. We approximate the core to be constant density, so the core mass is,

[formula]

Disk Galaxy Nuclear Star Clusters

The data for the nuclear star clusters in disk galaxies comes from the work of [\citet=Boker:04] and [\citet=Walcher:05], who also estimated phase space densities at the half-mass radius. There are six galaxies in Table 3 of [\citet=Walcher:05] for which values of the profile fitted re are available in the [\citet=Boker:04] paper. Densities for these galaxies were calculated using Equation [\ref=eq_rhoc] above but with [formula] (that is, the rh of [\citet=Walcher:05]). This identification of core radius effectively considers the entire NSC to be a core. Depending on the concentration of the core, the phase density can be several times higher. Under this assumption, Q0 for each galaxy can then be calculated from the tabulated values of σ. In the figures these six galaxies are plotted as solid green dots. For the remaining galaxies in the [\citet=Boker:04] Table 1 with re values, core masses were calculated from the given luminosities and an assumed M / L of 0.5 which is the median value in Table 3 of the [\citet=Walcher:05] paper. Velocity dispersions were obtained using the following empirically determined relation by fitting to the data in Table 3 of [\citet=Walcher:05],

[formula]

The resulting empirically determined values of Q0 are plotted as green crosses in the figures.

The data are plotted in the rc vs σ0 observational plane in Figure [\ref=fig_sigr]. Power-law cores are plotted as blue dots and cored galaxies as red dots. We note that in this plot the various types of objects have substantial overlap when projected onto any one axis. There is also substantial mass overlap between the various object types.

Q0 dependence of Core Slope

In Figure [\ref=fig_qgam] we plot the core phase densities as a function of their inner brightness profile slope, [formula], for all early type galaxies for both the [\citet=Lauer:07b] and [\citet=Krajnovic:13] samples. A strong correlation between the log of Q0 and [formula] is readily visible. The Pearson linear correlation coefficients for the [formula] correlation is 0.78 for the [\citet=Lauer:07b] sample and 0.83 for the [\citet=Krajnovic:13] sample. That is, the core phase space density explains an impressive 69% (= r2) of the variance in [formula]. The correlation of [formula] with luminosity is fairly weak in the ATLAS3D sample, -0.51, i. e. only about 25% of the variance, where we use the log of the r band luminosities, Lr, of [\citet=Cappellari:13XV]. The correlation of log Q0 and either log of the stellar mass or r band luminosity is also comparably weak, r =  -0.49 and -0.50, respectively. The weak correlation with the total mass or luminosity of the galaxy indicates that although early type cores evolve within their host galaxy, the host galaxy does not completely control the resulting core properties.

To further explore the correlation of core density profile and the bimodality proposals, Figures [\ref=fig_hisq] and [\ref=fig_hisqk] show for the two early type samples the distribution of their core and power-law types, [formula] and [formula] respectively, as a function of their phase space density. Remarkably Q0 fairly cleanly separates the cored and power-law ellipticals into two almost non-overlapping distributions. The relative numbers of core and power-law galaxies are comparable in both samples. Of the 25 cored and 26 power-law galaxies in the [\citet=Krajnovic:13] sample, only one from each falls into an overlapping region of Q0 in Figure [\ref=fig_hisqk].

The intermediate core types, those with [formula], fill in the Q0 region between the cored and power-law types. The intermediate core slope population is relatively large in the [\citet=Krajnovic:13] sample, 22 of the 74, with 11 of the 189 in the [\citet=Lauer:07b] sample, likely reflecting the difference between the sample selection criteria. Although it is true that cored and power-law galaxies do form two nearly non-overlapping distributions in Q0, a more physical interpretation is that [formula] is a continuous variable that is strongly ordered with the core Q0. We note that the transition from power-law to cored galaxies occurs near [formula].

Dynamical Quantities and Q0

Core Mass

The core phase densities of early type galaxies, nuclear star clusters and globular clusters are shown in Figure [\ref=fig_qmc] as a function of the calculated core mass. As a group the objects appear to form a single sequence in this particular dynamical space. There is a distinct break in the slope between cored and power-law galaxies.

We know about what to expect for a Q0 - Mc relation. Equations [\ref=eq_Q] and [\ref=eq_mc] give [formula]. If we take a Faber-Jackson relation for the core to be, [formula] and use Equation [\ref=eq_rhoc] to eliminate the density, then

[formula]

The power-law cores in Figure [\ref=fig_qmc] have a Q0 - Mc slope from 72 points - 1.109  ±  0.064 whereas the 105 cored early type galaxies have - 1.641  ±  0.025. [\citet=KB:13] find Faber-Jackson relationships, [formula], where their n = 1 / β, or n≃3.74 for power law galaxies and 8.33 for cores, assuming that the core mass is directly proportional to the total luminosity, which is approximately true as shown in Figure [\ref=fig_mcmv]. Accordingly we would expect Q0 - Mc slopes of -1.20 and -1.64, consistent with the fitted relations, for power-law and cored early types, respectively. The correlation between Q0 and Mc has r =  0.95. However Q0 is better predictor of [formula], with 81% confidence that the increased correlation of [formula] over [formula] is significant.

Rotation

[\citet=Lauer:12] showed that core type correlates well with the rotation parameter calculated from the sub-sample of ellipticals with rotation maps [\citep=Emsellem:04]. The kinematic data has been obtained with ground based telescopes so does not have the angular resolution of the imaging data. However, it remains of considerable interest to compare the core phase space density with rotation properties at a larger radius. Figure [\ref=fig_lam] shows the correlation of the rotation parameter values of [\citet=Emsellem:11] measured within Re / 2 and the ATLAS3D Q0 values. There is a range of rotation at every Q0, with a growing maximum rotation with increasing Q0. The Q0  -  λRe / 2 correlation coefficient is 0.55. Factors other than Q0 dominate the rotation value for an individual galaxy, which is hardly surprising given that a significant range in the initial angular momentum is expected. However Q0 usefully indicates the mean rotation, with a value of [formula] above the critical value of Q0 = 0.003 whereas it is [formula] below.

We note that the ATLAS3D sample we are using contains a number of kinematically distinct cores (KDC) defined on the basis that the kinematic axis changes by at least [formula] [\citep=Krajnovic:11II] For our sub-sample one KDC occurs in an intermediate core type, the 8 others are in cored galaxies, consistent within the small numbers with the expected fraction of about half the cored galaxies.

Dark Matter Fraction

It is straightforward to undertake a principal component analysis (PCA) using the R project software (http://www.r-project.org/). We remove strongly correlated variables, leaving the PCA with [formula], the r band luminosity, and the parameters reported in [\citet=Cappellari:13XX], the flattening at Re / 2, the rotation parameter within Re / 2, the kinematic/photometric misalignment angle, ψ, and fDM, the dark matter fraction inside Re. The PCA finds that the first component provides 49% of the variance, and three components of seven are required to provide 80% of the variance. The PCA confirms that Q0 is the single most strongly correlated variable with [formula]. However the next most correlated variable is the dark matter fraction, fDM, as evaluated at Re. A general linear model fit finds [formula]. The fDM term has a probability of only 0.8% of chance occurrence and the rotation term λRe / 2 has a probability of 1.6% of chance occurrence. However, log Q0 removes about 69% of the variance, whereas both fDM and rotation each account for only about 2.3%, leaving 26% unaccounted. The negative correlation with [formula] indicates that a lower dark matter fraction is associated with power-law cores. This is suggestive that somewhat more dissipated galaxies, hence lower dark matter fraction, are more likely to have steep core profiles at the same Q0, but it is a small effect.

Central Super-Massive Black Holes

Super-massive black holes are closely connected to galaxy cores although the evolutionary dependence is not entirely clear. There are well known correlations between the velocity dispersion of ellipticals and their black holes [\citep=Magorrian:98] [\citep=FM:00] [\citep=Gebhardt:00]. Black hole masses are available in [\citet=GrahamScott:13] and [\citet=MM:13]. Although the galaxies with black-hole masses are a subset of those with core density measurements, there is no clear bias other than the size and distance considerations needed to allow a black hole mass measurement. Figure [\ref=fig_bhr] shows the ratio of the derived black hole mass to our estimated core masses as a function of their core phase densities. The high Q0, power-law core, galaxies have core masses comparable to the black hole mass, with a median MBH / Mc≃0.5. That is, the cores of most galaxies with [formula] are within the black holes sphere of gravitational influence [\citep=MM:01]. Cored galaxies have much more massive cores on the average, with a median value MBH / Mc≃0.1.

Implications of Core Phase Densities

Dynamical Times in Dense Cores

The phase space density determines the time for two-body relaxation [\citep=BT:08]. We adopt the parameter choices of [\citet=Merritt:13], his Equation 5.61, to find,

[formula]

A relaxation time of 109 yr for a population of [formula] stars occurs for Q = 1.1. The power-law cores containing black holes shown in Figure [\ref=fig_bhr], have median Q0≃0.1, in which case interaction with two-body relaxation of stars around the black-hole likely plays a significant role in building and maintaining a power-law core [\citep=MerrittSzell:06].

The time scale for dynamical friction depends linearly on the phase space density and the mass of the inspiraling satellite [\citep=BT:08]. We again use the parameters of [\citet=Merritt:13], his Equation 5.32, to give the radial dependence of the dynamical friction timescale,

[formula]

where G(v / σ) is a slowly varying function with a value of 0.347 for [formula], roughly as expected for an inspiralling satellite. For a somewhat heavy [formula] globular cluster to spiral in within a 1010 years requires that it orbit in a region with a local [formula]. Therefore, the most massive early type galaxies, those with cores more massive than about [formula] (Figure [\ref=fig_qmc]) only allow globulars more massive than [formula] to spiral into the center.

Core Phase Density Evolution Pathways

A successful core formation and evolution scenario needs to offer a way to understand the correlations presented here between the core phase density and its brightness profile, rotation and black hole mass. High redshift progenitor galaxies may largely form with power-law cores through dissipative star formation processes [\citep=Loose:82] although current specific models appear to create too steep a Faber-Jackson relation [\citep=McLaughlin:06] [\citep=Antonini:13]. A widely investigated approximation, which we will follow, is to assume that the stars in the cores of early type galaxies were largely created elsewhere and brought to the core through merging and dynamical friction and possibly had their density profile altered through two-body relaxation. Here we briefly examine to what degree these stellar dynamical processes can account for the phase space correlations of core properties. Two widely discussed and quite distinct ideas are either that early type galaxies began with large low density cores which were subsequently built up, or, they were formed with power law cores, which were subsequently scoured out in the more massive galaxies. Both mechanisms may be at work.

The slope of the power-law cores in the Q0 - Mc diagram, Figure [\ref=fig_qmc], appears to be a continuation of the trendline from globular clusters through Nuclear Star Clusters. Precisely the same data are multiplied with its core mass squared to remove the basic mass dependence of Equation [\ref=eq_qm]. The rescaled results are displayed in Figure [\ref=fig_qm2m] which helps make the idea of two sequences clearer. Shown on the plot is a line of constant density, under the self gravitating virial assumption, which gives [formula] and therefore [formula].

N-body simulations for the bulk of the galaxy find β≃0.3 for equal mass mergers and β≃ - 0.3 for minor mergers [\citep=Naab:09] [\citep=Hilz1], although these values will not necessarily strictly apply to the cores. Recall that we have translated the Faber-Jackson relation to [formula]. The shallow trend of the cored early types in Figure [\ref=fig_qm2m] is highly suggestive that major merging dominates the evolution of these cores, with some admixture of minor merging to flatten out the relation, as has been noted from their Faber-Jackson relations [\citep=KB:13] If the merging were predominantly minor mergers it would cause Q0M2c to decline with increasing core mass, which is not seen. It is also suggestive that a steeper trend continues through power-law cores as has been previously noted [\citep=Walcher:05] [\citep=Cote:07] [\citep=Glass:11]. The globular cluster core densities are set through star formation processes and subsequent dynamical evolution. The globular cluster inspiral process will dissolve the clusters when the mean interior density of galaxy core and the cluster are equal, that is, the mass buildup will tend to push the increasing mass objects along a roughly constant density line, [\citep=CapuzzoDolcetta:08] [\citep=Hartmann:11]. A sequence of infall events leads to a modest increase in central density [\citep=Antonini:12]. The presence of a central black hole complicates the process but the general trends remain [\citep=Antonini:13].

The Power-law Core Buildup Scenario

Although not necessarily the only mechanism which creates shallow cores, one interesting possibility is that most of the stars in early type galaxies may have been formed in galactic disks, either isolated or in star bursts associated with merging. Subsequent merging of the stellar components leads to a core phase density that is no higher than the phase density of the central regions of the merging disks [\citep=TT:72] [\citep=Barnes:88] [\citep=Cox:06].

[\citet=Genzel:11] [\citet=Genzel:14] presents observational measurements of star forming galaxies near redshift two. The phase space density of a disk is Qd  =  Σ / (2hσ3), using our normalization and where Σ is the local surface density, h the scale height, and σ the velocity dispersion which we will take to be isotropic for simplicity. Taking high redshift disk parameters of [formula] (with some fraction as stars), z0≃300 pc, and [formula] [\citep=Genzel:11], which gives a representative central disk [formula]. The Milky Way has a comparable central phase density. Merging such stellar disks would create an initial core [formula], if about 1/3 of the gas eventually turns into stars and the rest of the central gas is driven away. Dissipationless merging of the stellar components of such disks would create galaxies with core phase densities comparable to the most massive, lowest Q0, early type galaxies [\citep=Carlberg:86]. For disks in the same potential, but with lower surface mass densities that phase density will be higher. That is, in a plane parallel sheet πGΣh  =  σ2, [formula]. To keep the Toomre disk stability parameter [\citep=Toomre:64] near unity, requires that the velocity dispersion adjust in proportion to the surface mass density, [formula]. Therefore [formula]. The minimum velocity dispersion of a galactic disk is approximately 10 , due to stirring of molecular clouds and internal motions of dissolving star clusters, so the highest phase density that merging disks would create would be [formula]. Therefore a pure disk merger scenario could account for the core phase densities of all the cored, [formula], early type galaxies but cannot account for the higher phase densities of the early type-galaxies with power-law cores. This is not to dismiss the important role that core scouring likely also plays, as discussed below.

Assuming that all early type galaxies do begin with fairly flat cores, a widely discussed mechanism for subsequent core buildup is that globular clusters can be dragged into the centers of galaxies [\citep=TOS:75]. Although the current globular cluster population is insufficient to provide the required mass, it is likely that at high redshift significantly more high mass clusters were present, which evolved under the action of various dynamical processes that have been studied and tested extensively [\citep=MW:97a] [\citep=MW:97b] [\citep=Fall:01] [\citep=MF:08] [\citep=Gieles:09] [\citep=Larsen:09] [\citep=Chandar:10] [\citep=FC:12]. Allowing for the evolution of the globular cluster population can build up all of the nuclear star cluster mass in galaxies with stellar masses below about [formula] [\citep=Antonini:12] [\citep=Antonini:13].

The phase density can be used for a rough calculation of the accreted globular cluster mass. As discussed with Equation [\ref=eq_tdf], the phase density at the maximum radius from which globular clusters can spiral in is [formula], at which phase density the interior stellar mass of [formula], which can be read off Figure [\ref=fig_qmc]. For the greatly enhanced progenitor globular cluster to stellar mass fraction of 0.04 that [\citet=GOT:13] suggest, the accreted mass will be [formula] which spirals down the center to build a core of that mass. Referring to Figure [\ref=fig_qmc] we see that this mass is approximately where the transition value of Q0≃0.003 that separates power-law from cored early type galaxies occurs. The globular cluster population enhancement, which only needs to apply to the inner kiloparsec or so, is about a factor of tend over current epoch galaxies have an average of approximately 0.003 of their stellar mass in globular clusters [\citep=Harris:13]. Outside the core the stellar density distribution that is providing the friction generally falls faster than the core mass - core radius relation so smaller cores, which have higher Q0, will bring in fewer clusters. Since the available globular cluster mass is proportional to the galaxy mass, the inspiralled globular cluster mass will scale in proportion to the core mass, Figure [\ref=fig_mcmv]. A second constraint on the progenitor globular cluster population is that it must have significant net rotation to produce the rotation of power law cores, Figure [\ref=fig_lam].

The detailed calculations of [\citet=GOT:13] predict that the excess mass in the core relative to the galaxy mass should be proportional to the inverse square galaxy mass, comparable to the excess mass-velocity dispersion relation of [\citet=Antonini:13]. To test this prediction we calculate ΔMc as the difference between Equations [\ref=eq_mc] and a constant density core. We define ΔMc as [formula]. The correlation between the logarithms of [formula] and [formula], the stellar mass of the galaxy, is a very weak r =  - 0.33 for all the ATLAS3D galaxies. Restricting the fit to the galaxies with [formula], i. e. all non-cored galaxies, the slope of the [formula] relation is [formula], in accord with the predicted inverse square root relation [\citep=GOT:13] but the correlation rises to only a marginal -0.49. Although it seems inevitable that a substantial number of globular clusters have spiralled into galactic cores, the predicted relation between ΔMc and [formula] accounts for only about 11% of the variance. Of course galaxy to galaxy differences in formation history, central globular cluster numbers, and the specific properties of the globulars from one galaxy to another could account for the scatter.

The Core Scouring Scenario

All early type galaxies could be created with fairly steep power-law cores, which then requires a mechanism to hollow out the cores in larger galaxies. Super-massive black holes pairs that come together after two progenitor galaxies merge will quickly sink into the core [\citep=Begelman:80]. Stars that encounter the pair can be ejected from the core to"scour" out of a power law core and produce a much shallower central density profile [\citep=Ebisuzaki:91] [\citep=Faber:97] [\citep=MM:01]. The process preferentially depletes stars on radial orbits to leave a relatively tangential velocity ellipsoid in the core [\citep=Quinlan:97] [\citep=MM:01] [\citep=Antonini:12]. Kinematic observations of a sample of cored early type galaxies do show the expected signature [\citep=Thomas:13]. Simulations have shown that a single binary black hole pair ejects only a few times the resulting merged black hole mass, so the small MBH / Mc ratios of cored galaxies require multiple mergers to successfully scour the core [\citep=Faber:97] [\citep=MM:01] [\citep=Merritt:06] [\citep=GualandrisMerritt:08] [\citep=Dullo:13].

[\citet=KB:13] present observational arguments for a scenario in which subsequent nearly dissipationless major merging dominates the formation of the most massive early type galaxies, as indicated by the very slow rise of central velocity dispersion with increasing mass. Their Faber-Jackson relations for core and power-law galaxies can be translated into the core phase density - core mass relation which we present. The core scouring model at present does not address the strong correlation between the core profile slope [formula] and the core phase density. Since power-law core galaxies also contain black holes they too should have been subject to core-scouring, but many of them have sufficiently high core phase densities that a power law core can be maintained or rebuilt [\citep=BW:76] [\citep=MerrittSzell:06] [\citep=Merritt:09]. Core scouring certainly plays some role which can vary from galaxy between creating the core to largely one of maintaining a shallow profile.

CONCLUSIONS

The coarse grain core phase density, Q0, of early type galaxies provides dynamical insight into the properties of the galactic cores and serves as a dynamical ordering parameter. The core phase density and the slope of the core brightness profile, [formula], are very strongly correlated, r = 0.83. We also find that for the standard definitions of cored and power-law profiles, [formula] and [formula], respectively, then Q0 does a very good job of separating the two distributions, although there is a substantial intermediate core slope population between the two. The transition from power-law and cored elliptical occurs around [formula]. Q0 correlates significantly but less strongly with the galaxy rotation, the ratio of the central black hole mass to the core mass, and quite weakly with the fraction of dark matter inside the effective radius.

Primordial cores could have been built as power-laws through dissipative star formation or as relatively low density cored profiles through disk merging. The two main models for subsequent core evolution, globular cluster inspiral and core scouring by black hole binary pairs, are considered relative to the phase space density correlations. We find that the predicted relation between excess mass above a flat core and galaxy stellar mass is present in the power-law and intermediate slope cores but with considerable scatter. In a diagram of Q0 weighted with the M2c as a function of Mc the power-law cores are the high mass end of a sequence from globular clusters through Nuclear Star Clusters. The sequence has slowly rising core density with mass, roughly as simulations of tidal dissolution of globular clusters have found. The cored early types are on a much shallower relation, about as would be expected from major mergers. The transition Q0 between power-law and cored early types can be understood as the maximum possible power-law core that can be built from the greatly enhanced globular cluster population at high redshift present in the largest cored early type galaxy. Core scouring clearly plays a role in maintaining fairly flat core profiles, but offers no ready explanation for the fairly abrupt disappearance of cored galaxies at a phase density of [formula].

We conclude that no single model completely explains the core slope-phase density relationship, although a combination of stellar dynamical effects seems likely to be the mechanism which leaves an indicative signature in the strong correlation with core phase density.
