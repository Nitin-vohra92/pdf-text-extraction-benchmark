On the rings of Fricke characters of free abelian groups

Eri Hatakenaka and Takao Satoh

Introduction

Let G be a group generated by [formula]. We denote by R(G) the set [formula] of all [formula]-representations of G. Let [formula] be the set [formula] of all complex-valued functions on R(G). Then we can regard [formula] to be a [formula]-algebra in a natural way. (See Subsection [\ref=Ss-Des] for details.) For an element x∈G, [formula] is defined to satisfy the equation

[formula]

for any ρ∈R(G). Here [formula]" in the right hand side means the trace of 2  ×  2 matrix [formula]. The element [formula] in [formula] is called the Fricke character of x. Let [formula] be the [formula]-vector subspace in [formula], which is generated by all [formula] for x∈G. Then [formula] has a ring structure with the multiplication of [formula]. We call [formula] the ring of Fricke characters of G over [formula].

Classically, Fricke characters were begun to study by Fricke for a free group Fn generated by [formula] in connection with certain problems in the theory of Riemann surfaces. (See [\cite=Fri].) In the 1970s, Horowitz investigated algebraic properties of [formula] by using the combinatorial group theory in [\cite=Ho1] and [\cite=Ho2]. In particular, he showed in [\cite=Ho1] that for any x∈G, the Fricke character [formula] can be written as a rational polynomial in [formula] characters [formula] for 1  ≤  l  ≤  3 and [formula]. Hence when we put [formula] to be a polynomial ring

[formula]

then there exists a surjective homomorphism [formula] defined by [formula]. The study of the ring structure of [formula] is inextricably associated with to that of the ideal [formula]. In general, however, it is quite a difficult problem to find a generating set of [formula] even in the case that G is a free group. (See also Subsection [\ref=Ss-Des].)

In the case that G is an abelian group, it is easy to see that any Fricke character of G is written as a rational polynomial in [formula] characters [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n and [formula] for 1  ≤  i1  <  i2  ≤  n. Hence when we put P to be a polynomial ring

[formula]

then there exists the surjective homomorphism [formula] defined by [formula] and [formula]. We denote by I the kernel of G.

In the present paper, we consider the case where G is a free abelian group [formula] of rank n. First, we introduce a descending filtration in [formula]. Set [formula]. We also denote by [formula] its coset class in [formula] by abuse of language. Consider the ideal J0 in P generated by all [formula]s. That is,

[formula]

Set J: = H(J0). Then, we have a descending filtration

[formula]

of ideals in P / I. (See Subsection [\ref=Ss-Des] for details.) Set [formula] for k  ≥  1. Each [formula] is a [formula]-vector space of finite dimension on which [formula] naturally acts. In general, to determine the structures of the graded quotients [formula] plays an important roles on various studies of the ring P / I. The first purpose of this paper is to give a basis of [formula] for any k  ≥  1. More precisely, we show the following theorem.

Needless to say, by an argument similar to the above, we can define the ideal JF in the ring [formula] of Fricke characters of the free group Fn generated by all [formula] for 1  ≤  l  ≤  3 and [formula]. Then we have a descending filtration [formula] in [formula], and the graded quotients [formula] for each k  ≥  1. Such graded quotients was originally studied by Magnus [\cite=Mg2] to investigate the behavior of the action of [formula] on [formula]. In [\cite=HS1], we gave bases of the graded quotients [formula] for k = 1 and 2. In general, however, it seems that no basis of [formula] is obtained for k  ≥  4. From Theorem [\ref=T-I-1], we can give a lower bound on a dimension of [formula] since the natural projection Fn  →  H induces the surjective homomorphism [formula]. More precisely, we have

For any k  ≥  1, let EFn(k) be the subgroup of [formula], consisting of automorphisms which act on JFn / Jk + 1Fn trivially. Then we have a descending filtration {EFn(k)}k  ≥  1 of [formula]. This filtration is a Fricke character analogue of the Andreadakis-Johnson filtration of [formula]. The Andreadakis-Johnson filtration was originally introduced by Andreadakis [\cite=And] in 1960's. The name Johnson" comes from Dennis Johnson who studied this type of filtration for the mapping class group of a surface in 1980's. It is called the Johnson filtration of the mapping class group. The Johnson homomorphisms are originally introduced by Johnson in order to investigate the graded quotients of the Johnson filtration in a series of his pioneering works [\cite=Jo1], [\cite=Jo2], [\cite=Jo3] and [\cite=Jo4]. In [\cite=Mo1], Morita began to study the Johnson homomorphisms of the mapping class groups and [formula] systematically. Today, together with the theory of the Johnson homomorphisms, the Andreadskis-Johnson filtration is one of powerful tools to study the group structure of the automorphism group of a group. (For basic material for the Andreadakis-Johnson filtration and the Johnson homomorphisms of [formula], see [\cite=S06] or [\cite=S15] for example.) In our previous paper [\cite=HS1], we also studied the graded quotients [formula], by introducing and using a Johnson homomorphism like homomorphism ηk for each k  ≥  1. The target of the homomorphism ηk is [formula]. In general, to determine the image of ηk is quite a difficult problem. Since ηk vanishes through the homomorphism

[formula]

induced from the natural projection Fn  →  H, from Theorem [\ref=T-I-1], we can obtain an information about the cokernel of ηk.

Now, by using Theorem [\ref=T-I-1], we can obtain the following.

Furthermore, from Theorem [\ref=T-I-1], we see that the ideal I is generated by polynomials of degree greater than one. This fact enables us to define the concept of a weight for each element of [formula]. Using this, we show

Finally, in Section [\ref=S-Rem], we will give some remarks on the natural action of [formula] on J / Jk + 1 for k  ≥  1. Let EH(k) be the kernel of a natural homomorphism [formula] induced from the action of [formula]. Let [formula] be an automorphism of H defined by

[formula]

Then we show the following.

(=   Proposition [\ref=P-erika] and Corollary [\ref=C-yuri].) For any k  ≥  1, the group EH(k) is the cyclic group of order 2, generated by ι.

Notation and conventions

Throughout the paper, we use the following notation and conventions. Let Fn be the free group of rank n with a basis [formula], and let H be its abelianization[formula]. Then H is a free abelian group of rank n, and the coset classes of [formula] form a basis of H as a free abelian group. We also use the following notations.

Let G be a group. The automorphism group [formula] of G acts on G from the right. For any [formula] and x∈G, the action of σ on x is denoted by xσ.

Let N be a normal subgroup of a group G. For an element g∈G, we also denote the coset class of g by g∈G / N if there is no confusion. Similarly, for a ring R, an element f∈R and an ideal I of R, we also denote by f the coset class of f in R / I if there is no confusion.

For elements x and y in G, the commutator bracket

[formula]

For pairs [formula] and [formula] of natural numbers [formula], we denote the lexicographic order among them by [formula]. Namely, this means i1  <  j1, i1  =  j1 and i2  <  j2, or and so on.

A filtration on the ring of Fricke characters of H

In this section, we briefly review the ring of Fricke characters of a finitely generated group G.

The ring [formula] of Fricke characters of a finitely generated group G

Let G be a group generated by [formula]. We denote by R(G) the set [formula] of all [formula]-representations of G. Let [formula] be the set [formula] of all complex-valued functions on R(G). Then [formula] has a [formula]-algebra structure by the operations defined by

[formula]

for any χ, [formula], [formula], and ρ∈R(G).

The automorphism group [formula] of G naturally acts on R(G) and [formula] from the right by

[formula]

and

[formula]

for any [formula].

For any x∈G, we define an element [formula] of [formula] to be

[formula]

for any ρ∈R(G). Here [formula]" in the right hand side means the trace of 2  ×  2 matrix ρ(x). The element [formula] in [formula] is called the Fricke character of x∈G. The action of an element [formula] on [formula] is given by [formula]. We have the following well-known formulae:

[formula]

for any x,y,z,w∈G. The equations ([\ref=eq-4]) and ([\ref=eq-5]) are due to Vogt [\cite=Vog]. (For details, see Section 3.4 in [\cite=MaR] for example.)

Let [formula] be the [formula]-vector subspace of [formula] generated by all [formula] for x∈G. The set [formula] naturally has a ring structure from ([\ref=eq-3]). We call [formula] the ring of Fricke characters of G over [formula]. Let [formula] be a rational polynomial ring

[formula]

of [formula] indeterminates. Consider a ring homomorphism [formula] defined by

[formula]

We see [formula]. By a classical result due to Horowitz, we have

For any group G generated by [formula], the homomorphism [formula] is surjective.

More precisely, Horowitz obtained a generating set of the ring of Fricke characters of G over [formula] in [\cite=Ho1]. Using this and ([\ref=eq-5]), we can obtain the above theorem. We should remark that in general, the structure of an ideal

[formula]

is quite difficult. For example, its generating set is not obtained even in the case where G is a free group Fn in general. Horowitz [\cite=Ho1] showed that [formula] for n = 1 and 2, and that [formula] is a principal ideal generated by a quadratic polynomial

[formula]

where

[formula]

For n  ≥  4, Whittemore [\cite=Whi] showed that the ideal [formula] is not principal. However, very little is known for [formula] for general n  ≥  4.

The ring [formula] for an abelian group G

Now, in the following, we always consider the case where G is abelian. In this case, we see

[formula]

from ([\ref=eq-4]). This shows that if G is abelian, and is generated by [formula], it turns out that [formula] is generated by [formula],

[formula]

by Theorem [\ref=T-Hor1]. In other words, consider a polynomial ring

[formula]

and a ring homomorphism [formula] defined by

[formula]

Then [formula] is surjective. Set [formula]. In this paper, we always identify P / I with [formula] as a ring under the isomorphism induced from [formula], and also call each of them the ring of Fricke characters of G over [formula].

Next, set [formula]. We also denote by [formula] its coset class in P / I by abuse of language. An element in [formula] corresponding to [formula] is

[formula]

Consider an ideal

[formula]

generated by all [formula]'s in P, and

[formula]

Then, we have a descending filtration

[formula]

of ideals of P / I. Set

[formula]

Then each of [formula] is a finite dimensional [formula]-vector space. In the present paper, for the case where G is a free abelian group H of rank n, we determine the [formula]-vector space structures of [formula] for any k  ≥  1. More precisely, we give a basis of each of [formula] in Section [\ref=S-Str].

Basic formulae among [formula]

In this subsection, we summarize basic and useful formulae among [formula] for x∈G. To begin with, we confirm the following.

[formula]

and

[formula]

These formulae hold for any group G and x,y,z,w∈G. For details, see section 4 in our previous paper [\cite=HS1].

For any x∈G and [formula],

[formula]

Proof. It is obvious when α = 0,1. It suffices to show α  >  0. We show this by the induction on α. Assume α  ≥  2. Then, substituting xα - 1 and x to x and y in ([\ref=eq-8]) respectively, we have

[formula]

and hence by the inductive hypothesis we obtain

[formula]

This completes the proof of Lemma [\ref=L-candy]. [formula]

Here we consider additional relations among [formula] for abelian group G.

For an abelian group G and any x,y,z,w∈G, we have

[formula]

Proof. In order to obtain the equation above, it suffices to calculate

[formula]

with the equation ([\ref=eq-20]). The calculation is straightforward. We leave it to the reader for an exercise. [formula]

As special cases of Lemma [\ref=L-colon], we see the following corollaries.

For an abelian group G and x,y,z∈G, we have

[formula]

For an abelian group G and x,y∈G, we have

[formula]

The structure of a [formula]-vector space [formula] for G = H

The goal of this section is to give a basis of [formula] for any k  ≥  1 as a [formula]-vector space.

Proof. We prove this proposition by the induction on l  ≥  0. If l = 0 or 1, it is clear. Assume l  ≥  2.

First, assume that some elements in [formula] are equal. For simplicity, we consider three cases:

p1 = p2 and q1  ≠  q2,

p1 = q2 and q1  ≠  p2,

p1 = p2 and q1 = q2.

For the parts (1) and (2), by using Corollary [\ref=C-kofre], we see that under the modulo I, the monomial f can be written as a sum of monomials

[formula]

such that r  <  l. Hence by applying the inductive hypothesis to each of such monomials, we obtain the required result. We can discuss an argument similar to the above for the case (3) by using Corollary [\ref=C-sipre]. Therefore we assume that [formula] are distinct.

Now, by the assumption (p1,q1)  ≤  (p2,q2), we have p1 < p2. If q1  <  p2, then we have inequalities:

[formula]

Hence if we set [formula], then we can apply the inductive hypothesis to f', and obtain the required result.

Next, if p2  <  q1, we have inequalities:

[formula]

Then by using Lemma [\ref=L-colon], we can write f as a sum of monomials

[formula]

and

[formula]

such that r  <  l. If we apply the inductive hypothesis to [formula] and [formula], we obtain the required result. This completes the proof of Proposition [\ref=P-popli]. [formula]

For each k  ≥  1 and 0  ≤  l  ≤  k, set

[formula]

Then

[formula]

forms a basis of [formula].

Proof. By Proposition [\ref=P-popli], we see that Sk generates [formula]. In order to show the linearly independentness of the elements of Sk, set

[formula]

for [formula], and assume (f)∈Jk + 1.

Consider the interior

[formula]

of the unit disk in [formula]. For any [formula], we define a representation [formula] by

[formula]

for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. If we consider the power series expansion

[formula]

at the origin on D, we can write each of [formula] and [formula] as a convergent power series:

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

Since (f)∈Jk + 1, if we regard (f)(ρ) as a polynomial on sis, its degree must be greater than or equal to 2k + 2. Hence all coefficients of degree 2k are zero.

To begin with, for any [formula], by observing the coefficients of [formula], we see [formula]. For any 0  ≤  l  ≤  k, assume that

[formula]

for any l  ≤  m. Then for any [formula] and [formula], we see

[formula]

Therefore by the inductive argument, we verify that all coefficients of f are equal to zero. This shows that elements in Sk are linearly independent. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=T-marine]. [formula]

By observing the proof of the Theorem [\ref=T-marine], we have the following.

The ideal I is generated by

[formula]

for any 1  ≤  i,j,r,s  ≤  n. Here remark that in the above notation, tij' should be read

[formula]

In particular, I is finitely generated.

Proof. Let I' be an ideal of P generated by elements ([\ref=eq-gen]). From Lemma [\ref=L-colon], we have I'  ⊂  I. For any f∈I, observing the proof of Proposition [\ref=P-popli] we see that f can be written as

[formula]

modulo I'. Here, in the sum of the right hand side of the equation above, k runs over finitely many non-negative integers. Hence by Theorem [\ref=T-marine], we see that all coefficients of f are zero, and obtain f∈I'. This shows I = I'. [formula]

We remark that if n = 1, we have I = (0).

[formula].

Proof. For any [formula], we can write f as ([\ref=eq-normal]). Then observing the coset class of f in [formula], we see that ap1q1 = ai1 = 0 for any 1  ≤  p1 < q1  ≤  n and 1  ≤  i1  ≤  n. Next, observing the coset class of f in [formula], we see that all coefficients of f of degree 2 are zero. By repeating this argument inductively, we obtain f = 0. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=T-sunshine]. [formula]

The primeness of the ideal I

In this section, we show that the ideal I is a prime ideal of P, in other words P / I is an integral domain. In order to show this, we introduce a weight of an element f∈P / I. From Theorem [\ref=T-sunshine], for any [formula], there exists some integer k  ≥  0 such that [formula]. Then we call k the weight of f, and denote it by [formula].

Proof. It is obvious if [formula] or [formula]. Hence we may assume [formula]. Set [formula] and [formula]. Since it is clear that [formula], assume [formula].

For any integers [formula], consider a group homomorphism [formula] defined by xi  ↦  xαi1 for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Then [formula] induces a ring homomorphism [formula] defined by

[formula]

Namely, we have

[formula]

Now, set

[formula]

and set [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] in [formula]. Hence the coefficient [formula] of FG of degree k1 + k2 is equal to zero. Here using Lemma [\ref=L-candy], we have [formula] for

[formula]

Consider [formula] as a polynomial in [formula]. Since [formula] if [formula] run over all integers, we see that [formula] as a polynomial in [formula]. Since [formula] is a domain, we have P1 = 0 or P2 = 0 in [formula].

Assume P1 = 0. Then each coefficient of monomials in [formula] in P1 is equal to zero. First, by observing the coefficient of [formula], we see

[formula]

Furthermore by an argument similar to that in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T-marine], we obtain that all [formula]s are equal to zero. Hence f∈Jk1 + 1. This contradicts to [formula]. By the same argument, if P2 = 0, we have g∈Jk2 + 1, and a contradiction. Thus, we conclude that [formula]. This completes the proof of Proposition [\ref=P-flower]. [formula]

As a corollary, we obtain

The quotient ring P / I is an integral domain. That is, the ideal I is a prime ideal in P.

Some remarks

Finally, we give some remarks about an action of the automorphism group [formula] of H on the ring [formula]. In general, for any group G, the automorphism group [formula] of G naturally acts on [formula] from the right. (See our previous paper [\cite=HS1] for details.) In particular, for any [formula] and x∈G, the action of [formula] on [formula] is given by

[formula]

Clearly, we see that the ideal J generated by all [formula] for x∈G is an [formula]-invariant ideal of [formula]. Hence [formula] naturally acts on [formula] for each k  ≥  1.

Let EG(k) be the kernel of a natural homomorphism [formula] induced from the action of [formula]. Then the groups EG(k) define a descending filtration

[formula]

of [formula]. In [\cite=HS1], we have showed that this filtration is central. That is   ⊂  EG(k + l) for any k,l  ≥  1. This is a Fricke character analogue of the Andreadakis-Johnson filtration of [formula]. (For details for the Andreadakis-Johnson filtration, see [\cite=S06] or [\cite=S14], for example.)

Here, we determine EH(1) and show EH(k) = EH(1) for any k  ≥  1. Let [formula] be an automorphism of H defined by

[formula]

Then we have

Proof. Clearly, we see EH(1)  ⊃  〈ι〉. For any σ∈EH(1), set

[formula]

It suffices to show

ej(i) = 0 if j  ≠  i,

[formula].

For any 1  ≤  i  ≤  n and any si∈D, consider a homomorphism [formula] defined by

[formula]

Then from

[formula]

by substituting ρi, we see

[formula]

and hence [formula]. On the other hand, by substituting ρj for j  ≠  i, we see

[formula]

and hence ej(i) = 0.

In order to show [formula], assume that ei(i)  ≠  ej(j) for some i and j. This means [formula]. For any si,sj∈D, consider a homomorphism [formula] defined by

[formula]

Then by substituting ρij to an equation [formula], we obtain

[formula]

This is a contradiction. Therefore we obtain the required result. This completes the proof of Proposition [\ref=P-erika]. [formula]

For any k  ≥  2, EH(k) = EH(1).

Proof. In general, we have EH(k)  ⊂  EH(1). On the other hand, EH(k)  ⊃  EH(1) immediately follows from Proposition [\ref=P-erika]. [formula]
