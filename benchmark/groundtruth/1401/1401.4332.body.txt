Introduction

Let (X,Δ) be a log canonical pair and let f:Y  →  X be a resolution such that KY  +  ΔY = f*(KX  +  Δ) and [formula] is a simple normal crossing divisor on Y. We put S = Δ= 1Y and ΔY = S + B. We consider the short exact sequence

[formula]

By the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem, we have R1f*OY( - S + ⌈ - B⌉) = 0. Therefore, we obtain

[formula]

where J(X,Δ) = f*OY( - S + ⌈ - B⌉) is the multiplier ideal sheaf of (X,Δ). Let [formula] be the non-klt locus of (X,Δ) with the reduced scheme structure. Then [formula]. This data

[formula]

is a typical example of . In general, [formula] is reducible and is not equidimensional. Note that the data

[formula]

also defines a natural quasi-log structure on X which is compatible with the original log canonical structure of (X,Δ). By the framework of quasi-log schemes, we can treat log canonical pairs and their non-klt loci on an equal footing.

The following theorem is the main theorem of this paper. It was stated in [\cite=ambro] without proof (see [\cite=ambro] and Remark [\ref=f-rem1.4]). For some related results, see [\cite=shokurov], [\cite=fukuda1], [\cite=fukuda2], [\cite=fukuda-lc], [\cite=fujino-reid-fukuda], [\cite=fujino-base], and [\cite=fujino-slc]. Note that the comment by Professor Miles Reid in [\cite=shokurov] is the origin of this type of basepoint-free theorems.

Let

[formula]

for some positive real number q. Assume that OX-    ∞(mL) is π-generated for every m  ≫  0. Then OX(mL) is π-generated for every m  ≫  0.

In [\cite=fujino-book], the author proved Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.1] with the extra assumption that [formula]. Note that the assumption [formula] is harmless for applications to semi-log canonical pairs in [\cite=fujino-slc]. We also note that Ambro's original statement (see [\cite=ambro]) only requires that π is . Unfortunately, our proof needs the assumption that π is because we use Kodaira's lemma for big [formula]-divisors on (not necessarily normal) irreducible varieties (cf. [\cite=fujino-slc]). Therefore, Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.1] is slightly weaker than the original statement (see [\cite=ambro]).

Precisely speaking, it is sufficient to assume that π is proper and that every qlc stratum C of

[formula]

In Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.1], if qL - ω is ample, then it is well-known that OX(mL) is π-generated for every m  ≫  0 (see [\cite=ambro], [\cite=fujino-book], and [\cite=fujino-foundation]). For the proof, see [\cite=fujino-book] (see also [\cite=fujino-foundation]).

We give a remark on [\cite=ambro].

Although Ambro wrote that the proof of [\cite=ambro] is parallel to [\cite=ambro], it does not seem to be true as stated, as there are some technical problems in the inductive step of the proof. Steps 1, 2, and 4 in the proof of [\cite=ambro] work without any modifications. In Step 3, q'L - ω' is π-nef but q'L - ω' = qL - ω is not always nef and log big over S with respect to

[formula]

.

As a special case of Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.1], we have:

Let (X,B) be a log canonical pair. Let L be a π-nef Cartier divisor on X where π:X  →  S is a projective morphism between schemes. Assume that qL - (KX + B) is nef and log big over S with respect to (X,B) for some positive real number q. Then OX(mL) is π-generated for every m  ≫  0.

Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.5] is nothing but [\cite=fujino-book] (see [\cite=fujino-foundation]). We believe that Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.5] holds under the weaker assumption that π is only . Note that we do not know the proof of Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.5] without using the theory of quasi-log schemes. The usual basepoint-free theorem for log canonical pairs, that is, Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.5] with the extra assumption that qL - (KX + B) is ample over S, can be proved without using quasi-log structures (see [\cite=fujino]). The proof in [\cite=fujino] is much simpler than the arguments in this paper.

In Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.5], if every log canonical center C of (X,B) is projective over S, then we can prove Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.5] under the weaker assumption that π:X  →  S is only . It is because we can apply Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.5] to the non-klt locus [formula] of (X,B). So, we may assume that OX(mL) is π-generated on a non-empty Zariski open subset containing [formula]. In this case, we can prove Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.5] by applying the usual X-method to L on (X,B). We note that C is projective over S when dim C  ≤  1.

The reader can find a different proof of Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.5] in [\cite=fukuda-lc] when (X,B) is a log canonical , where Fukuda used the log minimal model program with scaling for divisorial log terminal surfaces.

More generally, we have:

Let X be a normal variety, let B be an effective [formula]-divisor on X such that KX + B is [formula]-Cartier, and let π:X  →  S be a projective morphism between schemes. Let L be a π-nef Cartier divisor on X such that qL - (KX + B) is nef and log big over S with respect to (X,B) for some positive real number q. Assume that [formula] is π-generated for every m  ≫  0. Note that [formula] denotes the non-lc locus of (X,B) and is defined by the non-lc ideal sheaf [formula] of (X,B). Then OX(mL) is π-generated for every m  ≫  0.

For the details of [formula], see [\cite=fujino-nonlc] and [\cite=fujino]. Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.7] is new and is a generalization of [\cite=fujino] and [\cite=fujino-surface].

In this paper, we use the following convention.

The expression [formula] for every m  ≫  0  means that there exists a positive integer m0 such that [formula] for every m  ≥  m0.

We summarize the contents of this paper. In Section [\ref=f-sec2], we recall some basic definitions. In Section [\ref=f-sec3], we recall the basic definitions and properties of quasi-log schemes. Then we introduce various new operations for quasi-log structures (see Lemmas [\ref=f-lem3.12], [\ref=f-lem3.14], [\ref=f-lem3.15], and so on). Section [\ref=f-sec4] is devoted to the proof of the main theorem: Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.1].

We will work over [formula], the complex number field, throughout this paper. For the standard notation of the log minimal model program, see, for example, [\cite=fujino] and [\cite=fujino-foundation]. For the basic definitions and properties of the theory of quasi-log schemes, see [\cite=fujino-pull] (see also [\cite=fujino-foundation]). Note that [\cite=fujino-foundation] is a completely revised and expanded version of the author's unpublished manuscript [\cite=fujino-book]. For a gentle introduction to the theory of quasi-log schemes (varieties), we recommend the reader to see [\cite=fujino-intro]. In this paper, a means a separated scheme of finite type over [formula]. A means a reduced scheme.

Preliminaries

In this section, let us recall some basic definitions.

The notion of was first introduced in [\cite=shokurov] by Miles Reid. For the details of big [formula]-divisors on non-normal irreducible varieties, see [\cite=fujino-slc].

On quasi-log structures

In this section, we recall some definitions and basic properties of quasi-log schemes and prove some useful lemmas. We prove various new lemmas to make the theory of quasi-log schemes more flexible and more useful. For a quick introduction to the theory of quasi-log schemes (varieties), we recommend the reader to see [\cite=fujino-intro].

Let us quickly recall the definitions of and for the reader's convenience. For the details, see, for example, [\cite=fujino-pull] and [\cite=fujino-foundation].

Let Y be a simple normal crossing divisor on a smooth variety M and let D be an [formula]-divisor on M such that [formula] is a simple normal crossing divisor on M and that D and Y have no common irreducible components. We put BY = D|Y and consider the pair (Y,BY). We call (Y,BY) a and M the of (Y,BY). A of (Y,BY) is the ν-image of a log canonical stratum of (Yν,Θ) where ν:Yν  →  Y is the normalization and KYν  +  Θ  =  ν*(KY + BY).

The following lemma is obvious but very important.

Let Y be a smooth irreducible variety and let BY be an [formula]-divisor on Y such that [formula] is a simple normal crossing divisor. Then (Y,BY) is a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair.

We put [formula], [formula], and Y = Y  ×  {0}. Then D and Y are divisors on M such that D|Y = BY. This means that (Y,BY) is a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair.

In this paper, we adopt the following definition of quasi-log schemes. Although it looks slightly different from Ambro's original definition in [\cite=ambro], it is equivalent to [\cite=ambro].

A is a scheme X endowed with an [formula]-Cartier divisor (or [formula]-line bundle) ω on X, a proper closed subscheme X-    ∞  ⊂  X, and a finite collection {C} of reduced and irreducible subschemes of X such that there is a proper morphism f:(Y,BY)  →  X from a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair satisfying the following properties:

[formula].

The natural map OX  →  f*OY(⌈ - (B< 1Y)⌉) induces an isomorphism

[formula]

where IX-    ∞ is the defining ideal sheaf of X-    ∞.

The collection of subvarieties {C} coincides with the image of (Y,BY)-strata that are not included in X-    ∞.

We simply write

[formula]

(X, ω, f:(Y, B)→ X)

[formula]

, which is defined up to [formula]-linear equivalence. We sometimes simply say that

[formula]

, X-    ∞ is called the of

[formula]

. We sometimes use [formula] to denote X-    ∞.

For the details of the various equivalent definitions of quasi-log schemes, see [\cite=fujino-pull].

A of

[formula]

in the literature. We change the terminology (see Definition [\ref=f-def3.5] below).

Our definition of is different from Ambro's original one in [\cite=ambro].

A closed subvariety C of X is called a of

[formula]

which is not an irreducible component of X.

Let

[formula]

is a or

[formula]

We need the notion of on quasi-log schemes for Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.1].

Let L be an [formula]-Cartier divisor (or [formula]-line bundle) on a quasi-log pair

[formula]

.

The following theorem is a key result for the theory of quasi-log schemes. It follows from the Kollár-type torsion-free and vanishing theorem for simple normal crossing varieties. For the details, see [\cite=fujino-book], [\cite=fujino-vanishing], [\cite=fujino-inj], and [\cite=fujino-foundation].

Let

[formula]

. Then we have the following properties.

Assume that X'  ≠  X-    ∞. Then X' is a quasi-log scheme with ω' = ω|X' and X'-    ∞ = X-    ∞. Moreover, the qlc strata of

[formula]

that are included in X'.

Assume that π:X  →  S is a proper morphism between schemes. Let L be a Cartier divisor on X such that L - ω is nef and log big over S with respect to

[formula]

We give a proof of Theorem [\ref=f-thm3.8] for the reader's convenience because the theory of quasi-log schemes is not popular yet.

By taking some blow-ups of the ambient space M of (Y,BY), we may assume that the union of all strata of (Y,BY) mapped to X', which is denoted by Y', is a union of irreducible components of Y (see [\cite=fujino-pull]). We put KY' + BY' = (KY + BY)|Y' and Y'' = Y - Y'. We will prove that f:(Y',BY')  →  X' gives the desired quasi-log structure on

[formula]

0→ O(-Y')→ O→ O→ 0.

[formula]

0→ O(A-N-Y')→ O(A-N)→ O (A-N)→ 0.

[formula]

0→ fO(A-N-Y')→ I→ fO (A-N)→ 0.

[formula]

[formula]

I fO(⌈ -(B)⌉- ⌊ B⌋).

[formula]

is a quasi-log pair such that X'-    ∞ = X-    ∞. By construction, the property on qlc strata is obvious. So, we obtain the desired quasi-log structure of

[formula]

fO(A-N-Y')≃ fO(A-N)≃ I.

[formula]

f(L-ω)~ fL-(K+B)

[formula]

Rπ(fO(fL+A-N-Y')) =Rπ(I O(L))=0

[formula]

We usually call Theorem [\ref=f-thm3.8] (i) for quasi-log schemes.

Let us recall the following well-known lemma for the reader's convenience (see [\cite=ambro], [\cite=fujino-book], and [\cite=fujino-foundation]).

Let

[formula]

. Then X is normal.

The following proof is different from Ambro's original one (see [\cite=ambro]).

Let f:(Y,BY)  →  X be a quasi-log resolution. Since [formula], we have f*OY(⌈ - (B< 1Y)⌉)≃OX. This implies that f*OY≃OX. Let ν:Xν  →  X be the normalization. By assumption, X is irreducible and every stratum of (Y,BY) is mapped onto X. Thus the indeterminacy locus of [formula] contains no strata of (Y,BY). By modifying (Y,BY) suitably by [\cite=fujino-pull], we may assume that f:Y  →  X factors through Xν.

[formula]

Note that the composition

[formula]

is an isomorphism. This implies that OX≃ν*OXν. Therefore, X is normal.

We introduce [formula], which is a generalization of the notion of non-klt loci (see [\ref=f-say2.2]).

Let

[formula]

is denoted by [formula]. The scheme structure of [formula] is defined in Theorem [\ref=f-thm3.8]. If [formula], then

[formula]

is a quasi-log scheme by Theorem [\ref=f-thm3.8]. Note that [formula] is denoted by [formula] and is called the of a quasi-log scheme

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=f-thm3.11] is also a key result for the theory of quasi-log schemes.

Assume that

[formula]

Let C1 and C2 be two qlc strata of

[formula]

The following lemma is very useful for some applications. By Lemma [\ref=f-lem3.12], we can throw away the redundant components of Y from the quasi-log resolution f:(Y,BY)  →  X.

Let [formula] be a quasi-log scheme as in Definition [\ref=f-def3.3]. Then we can construct a new quasi-log resolution f':(Y',BY')  →  X such that

f':(Y',BY')  →  X gives the same quasi-log structure as one given by f:(Y,BY)  →  X, and

every irreducible component of Y' is mapped to [formula], the closure of [formula] in X, by f'.

Let M be the ambient space of (Y,BY). By taking some blow-ups of M, we may assume that the union of all strata of (Y,BY) that are not mapped to [formula], which is denoted by Y'', is a union of some irreducible components of Y (see [\cite=fujino-pull]). We put Y' = Y - Y'' and KY'' + BY'' = (KY + BY)|Y''. We may further assume that the union of all strata of (Y,BY) mapped to [formula] is a union of some irreducible components of Y by [\cite=fujino-pull]. We consider the short exact sequence

[formula]

We put A = ⌈ - (B< 1Y)⌉ and N = ⌊B> 1Y⌋. By applying [formula], we have

[formula]

By taking f*, we obtain

[formula]

By [\cite=fujino-vanishing] and [\cite=fujino-book] (see also [\cite=fujino-foundation]), no associated prime of R1f*OY''(A - N - Y') is contained in [formula]. Note that

[formula]

Therefore, the connecting homomorphism

[formula]

is zero. This implies that

[formula]

is exact. The ideal sheaf J = f*OY''(A - N - Y') is zero when it is restricted to X-    ∞ because J  ⊂  IX-    ∞. On the other hand, J is zero on [formula] because f(Y'')  ⊂  X-    ∞. Therefore, we obtain J = 0. Thus we have IX-    ∞ = f*OY'(A - N). So f' = f|Y':(Y',BY')  →  X, where KY' + BY' = (KY + BY)|Y', gives the same quasi-log structure as one given by f:(Y,BY)  →  X with the property (ii).

Lemma [\ref=f-lem3.13] is obvious. We will sometimes use it implicitly in the theory of quasi-log schemes.

Let

[formula]

is a quasi-log scheme with only quasi-log canonical singularities.

By using Lemma [\ref=f-lem3.12], we obtain Lemma [\ref=f-lem3.14]. Roughly speaking, by Lemma [\ref=f-lem3.14], we can through away the irreducible components of X contained in X-    ∞ from the quasi-log pair

[formula]

be a quasi-log scheme. We consider [formula], the closure of [formula] in X, with the reduced scheme structure. Then

[formula]

. This means that

C is a qlc stratum of

[formula]

, and

[formula].

Let IX† be the defining ideal sheaf of X† on X. Let f':(Y',BY')  →  X be the quasi-log resolution constructed in the proof of Lemma [\ref=f-lem3.12]. Note that

[formula]

and that

[formula]

set theoretically, where A = ⌈ - (B< 1Y')⌉ and N = ⌊B> 1Y'⌋ (see [\cite=fujino-pull]). Therefore, we obtain

[formula]

Thus we can construct the following big commutative diagram.

[formula]

By construction, f' factors through X†. We put g:(Y',BY')  →  X†. Then g:(Y',BY')  →  X† gives the desired quasi-log structure on

[formula]

We need Lemma [\ref=f-lem3.15] in the proof of Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.1].

Let

[formula]

=ω+ε E

[formula]

has a natural quasi-log structure with the following properties.

Let {Ci}i∈I be the set of qlc strata of

[formula]

X=(C) (X, ω)

[formula]

if and only if C is a qlc stratum of

[formula]

Let f:(Y,BY)  →  X be a quasi-log resolution as in Definition [\ref=f-def3.3]. By [\cite=fujino-pull], the union of all strata of (Y,BY) mapped to [formula], which is denoted by Y'', is a union of some irreducible components of Y. We put Y' = Y - Y'' and KY' + BY' = (KY + BY)|Y'. We may further assume that (Y',BY' + f*E) is a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair by [\cite=fujino-pull]. We consider f:(Y',BY'  +  εf*E)  →  X with 0 < ε  ≪  1. We put A = ⌈ - (B< 1Y)⌉ and N = ⌊B> 1Y⌋. Then [formula] is defined by the ideal sheaf f*OY'(A - N - Y'') (see the proof of Theorem [\ref=f-thm3.8]). Note that

[formula]

Therefore, if we define [formula] by the ideal sheaf

[formula]

then f:(Y',BY'  +  εf*E)  →  X gives the desired quasi-log structure on

[formula]

The following lemma is a slight generalization of [\cite=fujino-book], which played a crucial role in the proof of the rationality theorem for quasi-log schemes (see [\cite=fujino-book] and [\cite=fujino-foundation]).

Let

[formula]

passing through x.

We prove this lemma by induction on the dimension. Anyway, we obtained the desired inequality k  ≤   dim xCx, where Cx is the minimal qlc stratum of

[formula]

Proof of the main theorem

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.1].

We divide the proof into several steps.

Thus we obtain the desired basepoint-free theorem.

Let C be a nodal curve on a smooth surface. Then

[formula]

Finally, we prove Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.5] and Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.7].

Let f:Y  →  X be a resolution such that KY + BY = f*(KX + B) and [formula] is a simple normal crossing divisor on Y. By Lemma [\ref=f-lem3.2], (Y,BY) is a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair. Then f:(Y,BY)  →  X defines a quasi-log structure on

[formula]

if and only if C is a log canonical stratum of (X,B). Therefore, Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.7] is a special case of Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.1]. Moreover, Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.5] is a special case of Theorem [\ref=f-thm1.7].
