Automorphism groups of smooth plane curves with many Galois points

Introduction

Let the base field K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p = 2 and let q = 2e  ≥  4. We consider smooth plane curves given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula]. These curves appear in the classification list of smooth plane curves with at least two Galois points ([\cite=fukasawa2], see [\cite=miura-yoshihara] [\cite=yoshihara] for definition of Galois point). The automorphism groups of other curves (Fermat, Klein quartic and the curve x3 + y4 + 1 = 0) in the list were studied by many authors (see, for example, [\cite=hkt] [\cite=hurt] [\cite=ks] [\cite=ritzenthaler]). In this paper, we settle the automorphism groups of these curves, as follows.

Let C be the plane curve given by () of degree q + 1 and genus gC = q(q - 1) / 2. Then, [formula]. In particular, |Aut(C)| = q3 - q and >  84(gC - 1) if q  ≥  64.

Let C be the plane curve given by () of degree four. Then, Aut(C) is isomorphic to the symmetric group S4 of degree four. In particular, |Aut(C)| = 24.

It is well known that the order of the automorphism group of any curve with genus gC > 1 is bounded by 84(gC - 1) in characteristic zero, by Hurwitz. Our curve given by () is an ordinary curve whose automorphism group exceeds the Hurwitz bound (see Remark [\ref=ordinary]). This is different from examples of Subrao [\cite=subrao] and Nakajima [\cite=nakajima] by the genera.

Our theorems are proved by considering the Galois groups at Galois points. Therefore, our study is related to the results of Kanazawa, Takahashi and Yoshihara [\cite=kty], Miura and Ohbuchi [\cite=mo].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=inner]

According to [\cite=acgh] or [\cite=chang], any automorphism of smooth plane curves of degree at least four is the restriction of a linear transformation. Therefore, we have an injection

[formula]

Let LY be the line given by Y = 0, and let P1 = (1:0:0) and P2 = (0:0:1). A point [formula] is said to be Galois, if the field extension induced by the projection πP from P is Galois. If P is a Galois point, then we denote by GP the Galois group. For γ∈Aut(C), we denote the set [formula] by Lγ. We have the following properties for curves with () (see also [\cite=fukasawa2]).

Let C be the plane curve given by (). Then, we have the following.

[formula], where [formula] is the set of [formula]-rational points of LY. We denote by [formula].

The set of Galois points on C coincides with [formula].

For the projection πP1 from P1, the ramification index at P1 is q and there are exactly (q - 1) lines [formula] such that the ramification index at each point of [formula] is equal to two. Furthermore, σ(P1) = P1 for any σ∈GP1.

If i,j,k are different, then there exists σ∈GPi such that σ(Pj) = Pk.

Since the set [formula] is given by [formula], we have (a). See [\cite=fukasawa1], [\cite=fukasawa2] for (b). An automorphism σ∈GP1 is given by (x,y)  ↦  (x + αy + α2,y) for some [formula] (see [\cite=fukasawa2]). Then, the set Lσ coincides with the line defined by αY + α2Z = 0. It follows from [\cite=stichtenoth] that we have (c). Since GPi acts on [formula] transitively if [formula] is a line passing through Pi by a natural property of Galois extension ([\cite=stichtenoth]), we have (d).

We determine Aut(C).

The restriction map γ  ↦  γ|LY gives an injection

[formula]

Let γ∈Aut(C). Since the set of Galois points is invariant under the linear transformation, [formula], by Proposition [\ref=fundamental](a)(b). Therefore, r is well-defined.

Assume that γ|LY is identity. Then, γ(TPiC) = Tγ(Pi)C = TPiC and the point given by [formula] is fixed by γ for any i. If [formula], then TPiC is given by [formula]. Since γ|TP1C is an automorphism of [formula] and there are q (  ≥  4) points fixed by γ, γ|TP1C is identity. Since γ|LY = 1 and γ|TP1C = 1, γ is identity on [formula].

Let H(C): = {γ∈Aut(C)|γ(P1) = P1,γ(P2) = P2} and let [formula]. Then, r(H(C)) = H0. In particular, H0  ⊂  r(Aut(C)).

We have r(H(C))  ⊂  H0. According to [\cite=fukasawa2], H(C) is a cyclic group of order q - 1. We can also prove that H0 is a cyclic group of order at most q - 1 (see, for example, [\cite=fukasawa2]). Therefore, we have r(H(C)) = H0.

The restriction map r is surjective.

Let [formula] and let τ(P1) = Pi, τ(P2) = Pj. We take k  ≠  1,i. By Proposition [\ref=fundamental](d), there exists γ1∈r(GPk) such that γ1τ(P1) = P1. Further, by Proposition [\ref=fundamental](c)(d), there exists γ2∈r(GP1) such that γ2γ1τ(P1) = P1 and γ2γ1τ(P2) = P2. Then, γ2γ1τ∈H0. By Lemma above, γ2γ1τ∈r(Aut(C)). This implies τ∈r(Aut(C)).

We have [formula] by Lemmas [\ref=injective] and [\ref=surjective].

According to Deuring-[formula]afarevi[formula] formula ([\cite=subrao]), the p-rank γC of the curve C is computed by ramification indices for the Galois covering πP1. Using Proposition [\ref=fundamental](c), we have

[formula]

This implies γC = q(q - 1) / 2 = gC, i.e. C is ordinary.

We also have the following for Aut(C).

[formula].

[formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=outer]

Similarly to the previous section, we have an injection

[formula]

Let LZ be the line given by Z = 0, and let P1 = (1:0:0), P2 = (1:1:0) and P3 = (0:1:0). If P is a Galois point, then we denote by GP the Galois group. For γ∈Aut(C), we denote the set [formula] by Lγ. We have the following properties for curves with () (see [\cite=fukasawa3]).

Let C be the plane curve given by (). Then, we have the following.

The set of Galois points in [formula] coincides with [formula].

For each i, there exists a unique [formula] such that Lσi = LZ.

There exist exactly two lines [formula] such that [formula], [formula] and [formula] is the tangent line at two points in [formula]. Conversely, if [formula] is such a line, then there exists [formula] such that [formula].

There exist exactly four points [formula] such that the line [formula] which passes through Qi,Qj is a tangent line of C for each i,j with i  ≠  j and [formula] for some k. Such points are (0:0:1), (1:0:1), (0:1:1) and (1:1:1).

For (a)(d), see [\cite=fukasawa3]. For the sake of readers, we explain (b)(c) for i = 1. Let σ,τ be linear transformations given by

[formula]

Then, GP1  =  {1,σ,τ,στ}. Since σ|LZ = 1 and τ|LZ  ≠  1, we have (b). Note that the line Lτ is given by Y = 0 and the line Lστ is given by Y + Z = 0. Referring [\cite=stichtenoth], we have (c).

First we prove the following.

Let X = {Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4} and let S(X) be the group of all permutations on X. Then, there exists an injection [formula].

By Proposition [\ref=fundamental2](d), we have a well-defined homomorphism Aut(C)  →  S(X) by γ  ↦  γ|X. If γ∈Aut(C) fixes Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4, then γ fixes P1,P2,P3 also. Note that [formula]. Then, γ is identity on the projective plane.

We prove that |Aut(C)|  ≥  24. Let H: = 〈σ1,σ2〉.

The restriction map

[formula]

is surjective and its kernel coincides with H. In particular, |Aut(C)|  ≥  24.

Let γ∈Aut(C). Since the set of Galois points is invariant under the linear transformation, γ({P1,P2,P3}) = {P1,P2,P3}, by Proposition [\ref=fundamental2](a). Therefore, r is well-defined.

We consider the kernel. Assume that γ|LZ is identity. Let σi∈GPi be an automorphism as in Proposition [\ref=fundamental2](b) for i = 1,2 and let [formula] with τ  ≠  η. Then, γ(Lτ) = Lτ or Lη by Proposition [\ref=fundamental2](c). Therefore, σk2γ(Lτ) = Lτ, where k = 0 or 1. Since σ1 acts on [formula], σl1σk2γ is identity on Lτ and LZ, where l = 0 or 1. This implies that σl1σk2γ is identity on [formula]. We have γ∈H.

We prove that r is surjective. We have an injection [formula]. Let [formula] for each i. Since τ1τ2(P1) = P2, τ1τ2(P2) = P3 and τ1τ2(P3) = P1, the order of τ1τ2H∈Aut(C) / H is three. Since the group Aut(C) / H has elements of order two and three, we have Aut(C) / H = S3.

We have the conclusion, by these two lemmas.

We also have Aut(C) = 〈GP1,GP2,GP3〉  =  〈GP1,GP2〉.
