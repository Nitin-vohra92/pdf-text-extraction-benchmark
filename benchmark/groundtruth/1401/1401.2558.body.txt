φ-homological properties of Beurling algebras

Introduction

Johnson in [\cite=Joh1] extended the concept of amenability from locally compact groups to the Banach algebras. In fact A is an amenable (super amenable) Banach algebra, if every continuous derivation D:A  →  X*(D:A  →  X) is inner, for every Banach A-bimodule X, respectively. Also he showed that A is amenable if and only if A has an approximate diagonal, which is, a bounded net [formula] such that πA(mα)a  →  a and a  ·  mα - mα  ·  a  →  0 for every a∈A. In fact, he found out that, there is a direct relation between the Banach algebra [formula] and the amenability of A. During this period, there exists another approach to the amenable Banach algebras through the homology of Banach algebras. Some concepts like biflat and biprojective Banach algebras were introduced, which they have direct relation with super amenability and amenability, for more details the reader referred to [\cite=Hel] or [\cite=run]. Indeed A is a biflat (biprojective) Banach algebra, if there exists a bounded A-bimodule morphism [formula] such that [formula], respectively, see [\cite=run]. Recently the notion of left φ-amenable and left φ-contractible Banach algebras were defined and investigated in [\cite=Kan] and [\cite=Hu]. Indeed A is a left φ-amenable (left φ-contractible) Banach algebra, if H1(A,X*) = {0}(H1(A,X) = {0}), for every Banach A-bimodule X, which its left (right) action defined by a  ·  x = φ(a)x(x  ·  a = φ(a)x), respectively. The concepts of φ-biflat and φ-biprojective Banach algebras were introduced by authors in [\cite=sah]. They showed that L1(G) is φ-biflat if and only if G is an amenable group and A(G) is φ-biprojective if and only if G is a discrete group.

The content of this paper is as follows, after recalling some background notations and definitions, we investigate the φ-biprojectivity of Beurling algebras. Then we define a new approach to the homology of Banach algebras, which depends on a character of that Banach algebra. We use this approach to show that L1(G) is amenable if and only if some admissible homological structures of Banach algebras split.

Preliminaries

We recall that if X is a Banach A-bimodule, then with the following actions X* is also a Banach A-bimodule:

[formula]

Let A and B be Banach algebras. The projective tensor product of A with B is denoted by [formula] and with the following multiplication is a Banach algebra

[formula]

The Banach algebra [formula] is a Banach A-bimodule with the following actions

[formula]

Throughout the paper, Δ(A) is denoted for the character space of A, that is, all non-zero multiplicative linear functionals on A. Let φ∈Δ(A). Then φ has a unique extension on A*  * denoted by φ̃ and defined by φ̃(F) = F(φ) for every F∈A*  *. Clearly this extension remains to be a character on A*  *. We denote [formula] for the product morphism which is specified by [formula]. Let A be a Banach algebra and X be a Banach A-bimodule. We denote Hn(A,X) for nth cohomology group of A with coefficients in X. In fact, A is an amenable Banach algebra if and only if H1(A,X*) = {0}, for every Banach A-module X. The Banach algebra A is called φ-biprojective(φ-biflat), if there exists a bounded A-bimodule morphism [formula] ([formula]) such that [formula] ([formula]), respectively, for every a∈A. For the further details, we refer readers to [\cite=sah]. Let G be a locally compact group. A continuous map [formula] is called a weight function, if w(e) = 1 and for every x and y in G, w(xy)  ≤  w(x)w(y) and [formula] The Banach algebra of all measurable functions f from G into [formula] with [formula] and the convolution product is denoted by L1(G,w). The Banach algebra of all complex-valued, regular and Borel measures μ on G such that [formula] is denoted by M(G,w). We write M(G), whenever w = 1. The map [formula] which specified by

[formula]

is called augmentation character and its kernel is called augmentation ideal, for more details see [\cite=dale_lau].

Main results

Let A be a Banach algebra and L be a closed ideal of it. L is left essential as a Banach A-bimodule, if [formula]

Let A be a Banach algebra and φ∈Δ(A). Suppose that L  ⊆   ker φ is a closed ideal of A. Clearly φ induces a character [formula] on [formula], which is defined by [formula], for every a∈A.

Let A be a Banach algebra and φ∈Δ(A). Suppose that A is a φ-biprojective Banach algebra and L  ⊆   ker φ is a closed ideal of A which is essential as a left Banach A-bimodule. Then [formula] is [formula]-biprojective.

Since A is a φ-biprojective Banach algebra, there exists a bounded A-bimodule morphism [formula] such that [formula] for every a∈A. Let [formula] be the quotient map. Define [formula]. Since L is an essential closed ideal of A, for every l∈L, we have

[formula]

where [formula] for some a∈A and [formula]. Hence there exists an induced map (which still denoted by ρ1) [formula] Now define [formula] We will show that ρ2 is a bounded [formula]-bimodule morphism and [formula] Suppose that x∈A and [formula] for some sequences (axi)i and (bxi)i in A. Then [formula], so [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

Now suppose that a + L is an arbitary element of [formula]. Then [formula]. Since ρ is a left A-module morphism, ρ1 is a left A-module morphism. Hence Similarly one can show that ρ2 is a right [formula]-module morphism and the proof is complete.

Now we are going to define some homological properties for some particular Banach modules. In fact the following definition is motivated by the concepts of Banach homology, for more details about the parallel concepts the reader referred to [\cite=run].

A Banach A-bimodule X is called left ψ-projective, if there exists a non-zero character ψ on X and a bounded left A-module morphism [formula] such that [formula], where [formula] specified by [formula]. Similarly if X is a Banach A-bimodule and ρ is a right A-module morphism, then we can define the right ψ-projective Banach A-bimodules. A Banach A-bimodule X is called ψ-projective, if there exist bounded A-bimodule morphisms [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] where ψ is a character on X.

Note that a Banach algebra A is φ-biprojective if and only if the Banach A-module X = A with natural actions is φ-projective.

Using the same argument as in the [\cite=sam] we will give an example which shows the differences of the projective Banach A-bimodules (for the definition see [\cite=run]) and the ψ-projective Banach A-bimodules.

Let G be the integer Heisenberg group. One can see that G has an open abelian subgroup but is not a finite extension of an abelian group. We go toward a contradiction and suppose that X = A(G) is a projective A(G)-bimodule. Then by [\cite=run], A(G) is biprojective, hence is biflat. On the other hand, since G is amenable by Leptin's theorem A(G) has a bounded approximate identity, therefore A(G) is an amenable Banach algebra which has contradiction with main result of [\cite=for]. By [\cite=sah] it is easy to see that X = A(G) is a φ-projective Banach A(G)-bimodule. Let G be a discrete group. We want to show that [formula] is a ψ-projective Banach A(G)-bimodule, for some character [formula]. To see this, pick t0∈G and denote χ{t0} for the characteristic function at t0. It is well-known that φt0 is a character on A(G), which specified by φt0(f) = f(t0), for every f∈A(G). Consider [formula], which is a character on [formula] and defined by [formula], where f and g in A(G). Since for every f∈A(G) we have fχ{t0}  =  χ{t0}f = φt0(f)χ{t0} and φt0(χ{t0}) = 1, the map [formula] defined by [formula], is an A(G)-bimodule morphism. One can easily see that [formula]. Similarly we can define ξ and show that [formula], hence X is a ψ-projective Banach A(G)-bimodule.

Let A be a φ-biprojective Banach algebra with φ∈Δ(A). Let L  ⊆   ker φ be a closed ideal of A which is left essential as a A-bimodule. Then [formula] is a left [formula]-projective Banach A-bimodule.

Using the notations as in the proof of the previous Proposition, one can easily see that ρ1 is a bounded left A-module morphism and [formula] Then the proof is complete.

We recall that [formula] is a φ-Johnson contraction for A, if a  ·  m = m  ·  a and [formula], where a∈A, for more details the reader referred to [\cite=sah].

Let A be a Banach algebra and φ∈Δ(A). A is left φ-contractible if and only if there exists an element m in A such that am = φ(a)m and φ(m) = 1. For the further details the reader referred to [\cite=Hu] and [\cite=nas]. Compare the following proposition with [\cite=Hel].

Let G be a locally compact group. Then the following statements are equivalent:

L1(G,w) is φ0-biprojective;

L1(G,w) is left φ0-contractible;

G is compact.

(i)  ⇒  (ii) Let A = L1(G,w) and L =  ker φ0, where φ0 is the augmentation character and let A be φ0-biprojective. Since A has a bounded approximate identity, L becomes a left essential Banach A-bimodule. Thus by Lemma [\ref=lem1], [formula] is left [formula]-projective A-bimodule. So there exists a bounded left A-module morphism [formula] such that [formula], where [formula]. Let m = ρ(1)∈A. Then [formula] and [formula], where a∈A. In fact since [formula] with left outer multiplication a  ·  z = φ0(a)z is a projective left A-module, for every a∈A. Then A is left φ0-contractible, see [\cite=nas]. (ii)  ⇒  (iii) Suppose that A is a left φ0-contractible Banach algebra. Then there exists an element m∈A such that am = φ0(a)m and φ0(m) = 1, where a∈A. Let g∈G be an arbitary element and [formula]. Hence

[formula]

Hence m is constant and belongs to A, so is 1. Therefore

[formula]

so G is a compact group. (iii)  ⇒  (i) Let G be a compact group. Then [formula] in [formula] satisfies a  ·  m = m  ·  a = φ0(a)m and [formula], (we use normalized left Haar measure here), where a∈A, then A is φ0-Johnson contractible. Hence [\cite=sah] finishes the proof.

One can easily see that every biprojective Banach algebra A is φ-biprojective for every φ∈Δ(A) but the converse is not always true, see Example [\ref=ex1]. At the following corollary, we show that [\cite=run] for the group algebras, in the φ-biprojective case, is also valid. It is well-known that if G is compact, then G is amenable, hence by [\cite=run] Hn(L1(G),X*) = {0}, for every [formula] and for every Banach L1(G)-bimodule X.

Let G be a locally compact group.

If L1(G) is φ0-biprojective, then for every Banach L1(G)-bimodule X, Hn(L1(G),X) = {0}, where n  ≥  3;

L1(G) is φ0-biprojective if and only if H1(L1(G),X) = {0}, for every Banach L1(G)-bimodule X with x  ·  a = φ0(a)x such that a∈L1(G) and x∈X.

Using this fact that L1(G) is biprojective if and only if G is compact, see [\cite=Hel] , and by Proposition [\ref=main] and [\cite=run] one can easily show the part (i) is true. Part (ii) is true by Proposition [\ref=main].

Suppose that φ∈Δ(L1(G,w)). Pick an element i0∈L1(G,w) such that φ(i0) = 1. We define [formula] by φi0(a) = φ(ai0). Since L1(G,w) is a closed ideal of M(G,w), we have Then φi0 is a character on M(G,w) such that φi0|L1(G,w)  =  φ.

Let G be a locally compact group and let φ0 be the augmentation character of L1(G,w). Then M(G,w) is φi00-biprojective if and only if G is compact.

Let M(G,w) be φi00-biprojective. Then, since [formula] and L1(G,w) is a closed ideal of M(G,w), by [\cite=sah] L1(G,w) is φ0-biprojective. Now by Proposition [\ref=main], G is a compact group. For converse, let G be a compact group. Then [formula] is a φ0-Johnson contraction for L1(G,w). By similar arguments as in the proof of [\cite=sah], one can show that L1(G,w) is left and right φ0-contractible. Since L1(G,w) is a closed ideal in M(G,w) and [formula], one can easily see that M(G,w) is left and right φi00-contractible, by using the similar arguments as in the proof of [\cite=sah], one can easily see that M(G,w) is φi00-Johnson contractible. Now apply [\cite=sah] to show that M(G,w) is φi00-biprojective.

Suppose that A is a Banach algebra and a∈A. It is well-known that two maps b  ↦  ab and b  ↦  ba are w* - w*-continuous on A*  *, where b∈A*  *. Recall that A is a φ-Johnson amenable Banach algebra for some φ∈Δ(A), if there exists an element [formula] such that [formula] and a  ·  m = m  ·  a, for every a∈A, see [\cite=sah].

Let G be a locally compact group and let φ0 be the augmentation character of L1(G). If M(G)*  * is [formula]-biprojective, then G is amenable. Converse holds whenever G is a compact group.

Let M(G)*  * be [formula]-biprojective. Then by [\cite=sah], M(G) is φi00-biflat. Since M(G) has a unit, by [\cite=sah] M(G) is φi00-Johnson amenable, hence by [\cite=sah] M(G) is left φi00-amenable. Since L1(G) is a closed ideal of M(G) and φi00|L1(G)  ≠  0, by [\cite=Kan] L1(G) is left φ0-amenable, so G is an amenable group, see the proof of [\cite=run]. Let G be compact. Then it is easy to see that 1 is a left and right φ0-contraction for L1(G) where we consider normalized Haar measure. One can easily show that also 1 is a left and right φi00-contraction for M(G), since L1(G) is a closed ideal in M(G). Now by w* - w*-continuity of the maps b  ↦  b1 and b  ↦  1b, one can easily see that 1 is also a left and right [formula]-contraction for M(G)*  *. Define [formula] by [formula]. It is easy to see that ρ is a bounded M(G)*  *-bimodule morphism and [formula] and the proof is complete.

Let A be a Banach algebra and φ∈Δ(A). Suppose that X is a Banach A-bimodule. A character ψ on X is called a φ-character, if ψ(a  ·  x  ·  b) = φ(a)φ(b)ψ(x) for every a and b in A and x in X.

Let A be a Banach algebra and φ∈Δ(A). It is well-known that [formula], where [formula]. Clearly via the following module actions [formula] is a Banach A-bimodule:

[formula]

for every a,x and y in A. Hence, [formula] is a φ-character, since

[formula]

for every a,b,y and x in A. Another example for the notion of φ-character is given here. For φ∈Δ(A), it is easy to see that, there exists a unique extension of φ to A*  *, denoted by φ̃, such that φ̃(F) = F(φ), for every F∈A*  *. It is easy to see that φ̃∈Δ(A*  *) and A*  * is a Banach A-bimodule naturally. Also for every a,y in A and x in A*  *, we have φ̃(a  ·  x  ·  y) = φ(a)φ(y)φ̃(x). So φ̃ is a φ-character. The notion of φ-character reveals even for the quotient algebras. Let φ∈Δ(A) and L  ⊆   ker φ be a closed ideal of A. Suppose that [formula] is a induced character on [formula] by φ. Clearly [formula] is a Banach A-bimodule. Also since

[formula]

for every a,y and x in A, [formula] is a φ-character.

Let A be a Banach algebra and φ∈Δ(A). Suppose that E and P are Banach A-bimodules. Let the Banach A-module P has a φ-character, say ψ, and also let g be a bounded Banach A-module morphism from E into P. The triple (E,P,g) is called φ-admissible, if there exists a bounded, linear map ρ:P  →  E such that [formula], for every p∈P, also is called φ-split, whenever ρ is a bounded A-bimodule morphism.

Clearly if the triple [formula] is φ-split, then A is φ-projective Banach A-bimodule (with respect to the φ-character φ), hence A is φ-biprojective.

Let A be a φ-Johnson amenable Banach algebra, for φ∈Δ(A). Then every φ-admissible, triple (E*  *,P*  *,g) is φ-split triple, for every Banach A-bimodules E and P, provided g is a w* - w*-continuous A-bimodule morphism.

Since A is φ-Johnson amenable, there exists a bounded net [formula] such that

[formula]

for every a∈A, see [\cite=sah]. Let define a bounded linear map [formula], by [formula] and also let define bounded linear map [formula] by [formula] for every a and b in A. Moreover, one can easily verify that φ(R(x)) = φ(L(x)) = φ(πA(x)) for every [formula]. Also, we have L(x)a = L(x  ·  a), L(a  ·  x) = φ(a)L(x), aR(x) = R(a  ·  x) and R(x  ·  a) = φ(a)R(x) for every a∈A and [formula]. Using the above considerations, we have

[formula]

Similarly it is easy to see that aR(mα) - φ(a)R(mα)  →  0. The nets (R(mα))α and (L(mα))α are denoted by (Rα)α and (Lα)α, respectively. Suppose that the triple (E*  *,P*  *,g) is φ-admissible with respect to a φ-character ψ on P*  *, so there exists a character ψ0 on P such that its extension to P*  * is ψ, hence there exists a bounded linear map η:P*  *  →  E*  * such that [formula]. Let define ρ:P*  *  →  E*  * by ρ(x) = w*  -   lim Rα  ·  η(Lα  ·  x  ·  Rα)  ·  Lα. Since (Lα)α and (Rα)α are bounded nets and E*  * is a dual Banach A-module, this definition makes sense. Using the boundedness of (Rα)α and (Lα)α and since Lαa - φ(a)Lα  →  0, one can show that

[formula]

therefore

[formula]

Similarly, we have

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Thus ρ is a bounded left A-module morphism. Similarly, one can show that ρ is a bounded right A-module morphism. To finish the proof, we have to show that [formula]. To see this, let x∈P*  *. Using the w* - w* continuity of the bounded A-bimodule morphism g and since ψ  =   is a φ-character and P*  * is a dual Banach A-bimodule, we have because φ(Rα) = φ(Lα)  →  1. Then the proof is complete.

Let G be a locally compact group. Then G is amenable if and only if every φ-admissible, triple (E*  *,P*  *,g) is φ-split triple, where g is w* - w*-continuous L1(G)-bimodule morphism and P,E are Banach L1(G)-bimodules and also φ∈Δ(L1(G)).

Let G be an amenable locally compact group. Then L1(G) is an amenable Banach algebra. Hence, there exists an element [formula] such that a  ·  m = m  ·  a and π*  *L1(G)(m)a = a for every a∈L1(G). Therefore it is easy to see that [formula]. So L1(G) is φ-Johnson amenable, therefore by previous Proposition, if part is complete.

For converse, consider the triple [formula] where π*  *L1(G) is a w* - w*-continuous L1(G)-bimodule morphism. Let φ∈Δ(L1(G)). Pick an element a0 in L1(G) such that φ(a0) = 1. Define [formula] by [formula], where a∈L1(G). Clearly L1(G)*  * is Banach L1(G)-bimodule and φ̃ is a φ-character. It is easy to see that [formula] for every a∈L1(G)*  *. Hence the triple [formula] is φ-admissible. Then is φ-split, so there exists an L1(G)-bimodule morphism [formula] such that [formula], for every a∈L1(G)*  *. Hence [formula], where a∈L1(G). Then L1(G) is a φ-biflat Banach algebra. Now apply [\cite=sah] to show that G is amenable.
