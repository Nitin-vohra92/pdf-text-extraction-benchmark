Introduction

In this paper, we continue our study in [\cite=W] on the De Giorgi type conjecture, i.e. one dimensional symmetry problem for solutions of the following two component elliptic system in [formula]:

[formula]

We remove the energy minimizing condition in [\cite=W] and prove the one dimensional symmetry only under the linear growth condition. More precisely we prove

If (u,v) is a solution of the problem [\eqref=equation], and there exists a constant C > 0 such that for any [formula],

[formula]

then after a suitable rotation in [formula],

[formula]

The linear growth condition is sharp, as shown by the examples constructed in [\cite=BTWW], where u - v is asymptotic to a homogeneous harmonic polynomial of degree d  ≥  2. For more discussions on [\eqref=equation], we refer to [\cite=blwz] [\cite=BTWW] [\cite=C-L_2] [\cite=NTTV].

Through suitable rescalings, the problem [\eqref=equation] is closely related to the following singularly perturbed problem (see Theorem [\ref=thm_preliminary] below)

[formula]

which is used to describe the "phase separation" phenomena. When κ  →    +    ∞  , the convergence of solutions (uκ,vκ) of [\eqref=equation_scaled] and their singular limit were studied by Caffarelli and Lin [\cite=C-L_2], Noris-Tavares-Terracini-Verzini [\cite=NTTV] and Tavares-Terracini [\cite=TT2011] (see also Dancer-Zhang and the author [\cite=DWZ2011]).

The main ingredient of our proof is an improvement of flatness estimate for the singular perturbation problem [\eqref=equation_scaled], which is achieved by the blow up (harmonic approximation) technique. This type of arguments, first introduced by De Giorgi in his work on the regularity of minimal hypersurfaces [\cite=D], are by now classical in the elliptic regularity theory. It plays an important role in the establishment of many ε -regularity theorems, such as in the theory of stationary varifolds (cf. Allard [\cite=Allard], see also [\cite=Lin] for an account), harmonic maps (cf. L. Simon [\cite=Simon]) and nonlinear elliptic systems (the indirect method, see for example Chen-Wu [\cite=Chen-Wu]), just to name a few examples.

In singular perturbation problems, Savin's proof of the De Giorgi conjecture for Allen-Cahn equation [\cite=Savin] also uses an improvement of flatness estimate and the harmonic approximation type argument. However, there the quantity to be improved is different from the classical energy quantity. Indeed, the method developed in [\cite=Savin] is mainly on the viscosity (or Krylov-Safonov) side and corresponds to the Harnack inequality approach to the regularity of minimal hypersurfaces as developed in Caffarelli-Cordoba [\cite=C-C].

In this paper we will explore some aspects of harmonic approximation arguments in the singular perturbation problem [\eqref=equation_scaled], from the variational side. Thus in our estimate we still use an energy type quantity, which is similar to the excess used in Allard's regularity theory. In this sense, our method may be viewed as a direct generalization of the classical harmonic approximation technique in this singular perturbation problem.

However, in order to get a harmonic function in the blow up limit, we use the stationary condition arising from the equation, but not the equation [\eqref=equation_scaled] itself. Let us first recall the stationary condition. Given a κ > 0 fixed, any solution of [\eqref=equation_scaled], (uκ,vκ) is smooth. Let Y be a smooth vector field with compact support, then by considering domain variations in the form

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Through some integration by parts we obtain the stationary condition for (uκ,vκ),

[formula]

Here [formula] is the divergence operator, and for a function u,

[formula]

For the problem [\eqref=equation_scaled], we have better control and convergence on the energy level, while the equation itself is badly behaved. This is why we choose to blow up the stationary condition to get a harmonic function in the limit. Here we would like to mention that the stationary condition appears more naturally in some other singular perturbation problems, such as the Allen-Cahn model (cf. Hutchinson-Tonegawa [\cite=H-T]) and the Ginzburg-Landau model (cf. Bethuel-Brezis-Orlandi [\cite=B-B-O]). In these problems, the stationary condition is directly linked to the limit problem, i.e. the stationary condition for varifolds (in the sense of Allard [\cite=Allard]).

In the remaining part of this paper, a solution (u,v) of the problem [\eqref=equation] will be fixed. We use the notation aκ = O(bκ), if there exists a constant C such that, as κ  →    +    ∞  ,

[formula]

and we say aκ = o(bκ) if

[formula]

We use C to denote various universal constants, which are independent of the base point [formula] and the radius R. (In some cases it depends on the solution itself.) It may be different from line to line. Hs is used to denote the s - dimensional Hausdorff measure.

The improvement of flatness

First, to explain why our main Theorem [\ref=main_result] is related to a singular perturbation problem, let us recall the following result, which is essentially [\cite=W].

For any ε > 0, there exists an R0 such that if R  ≥  R0 and x0∈{u = v}, by defining

[formula]

there exists a constant c0 independent of x0∈{u = v} and R, and a vector e satisfying |e|  ≥  c0, such that

[formula]

Note that (uκ,vκ) satisfies [\eqref=equation_scaled] with κ = R4. For a proof of this theorem see [\cite=W]. The only new point is that, if

[formula]

then uκ - vκ is also close to e  ·  x in H1(B1(0)) topology. This can be proved by a contradiction argument, using the H1 strong convergence for solutions of [\eqref=equation_scaled] (cf. [\cite=NTTV]). Note that we can replace the global uniform Hölder estimate used in [\cite=NTTV] by the interior uniform Hölder estimate [\cite=W].

Throughout this paper, (uκ,vκ) always denotes a solution defined as in [\eqref=scaled_solutions]. The following improvement of decay estimate will be the main ingredient in our proof of Theorem [\ref=main_result].

There exist four universal constants θ∈(0,1 / 2), ε0 small and K0,C(n) large such that, if (uκ,vκ) is a solution of [\eqref=equation_scaled] in B1(0), satisfying

[formula]

where e is a vector satisfying |e|  ≥  c0 / 2, and κ1 / 4ε2  ≥  K0, then there exists another vector ẽ, with

[formula]

such that

[formula]

The proof will be given later. Note that this theorem is not a local result. It depends on the global Lipschitz estimate established in [\cite=W], which is stated for solutions of [\eqref=equation] defined on the entire space [formula].

This decay estimate can be used to prove

There exists a constant C > 0 such that, for any x∈{u = v} and R > 1, there exists a vector ex,R, with

[formula]

such that

[formula]

Fix an R > 1 and x0∈{u = v}, which we assume to be the origin 0. For each i > 0, denote

[formula]

Let Ei and the vector ei be defined by

[formula]

Note that for any fixed e,

[formula]

Hence we always have

[formula]

Furthermore, since (see [\cite=W])

[formula]

there exists a constant C, which is independent of i, such that

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=thm_preliminary], for any sequence i  →    +    ∞  , there exists a subsequence (still denoted by i) such that

[formula]

Here e is a vector in [formula] satisfying |e|  ≥  c0, and the convergence is in [formula] and also in [formula]. Note that (ui,vi) satisfies [\eqref=equation_scaled] with κi = R4i.

Indeed, by Theorem [\ref=thm_preliminary], if Ri  ≥  R0, where R0 is a constant depending only on ε0, there exists a vector ēi with |ēi|  ≥  c0 such that

[formula]

By definition, if we replace ēi by ei, we can get the same estimate. Thus by Theorem [\ref=thm_decay_estimate], if we also have Ei + 1  ≥  K0, or equivalently,

[formula]

then there exists another vector ẽi + 1 so that

[formula]

This can be rewritten as

[formula]

Now we claim that for all [formula],

[formula]

Assume by the contrary, there exists an [formula] such that Ei0  >  θ1 - nK0. First by [\eqref=1.1],

[formula]

Thus the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=thm_decay_estimate] are satisfied and we have [\eqref=1.3], which says

[formula]

This can be iterated, and we get, for any j  ≥  0,

[formula]

However, since 2 / θ > 1 / θ, this contradicts [\eqref=1.2] if j is large enough. Note that the constant θ1 - nK0 in [\eqref=1.4] is independent of the base point x0∈{u = v} and the radius R. Thus we get [\eqref=1.4] for any R  ≥  R0 and x∈{u = v}. Then by choosing a larger constant, this can be extended to cover

[formula]

With this theorem in hand, we can use ex,R  ·  (y - x) to replace the harmonic replacement φR,x in [\cite=W]. The following arguments to prove Theorem [\ref=main_result] are exactly the same one in [\cite=W].

The remaining part of this paper will be devoted to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_decay_estimate].

Some a priori estimates

In this section, we present some a priori estimates for the solution (u,v). These estimates show that various quantities, when integrated on BR(x), have a growth bound as Rn - 1. This is exactly what we expect for one dimensional solutions. Several estimates from [\cite=W] will be needed in this section.

There exist two positive constants C and M, such that for any R > CM and t  ≥  M,

[formula]

First, by [\cite=W], there exists a constant c(M) > 0 such that,

[formula]

Since u is smooth, by the implicit function theorem {u = t} is a smooth hypersurface.

Now

[formula]

Note that on {u = t}

[formula]

where ν is the unit normal vector of {u = t} pointing to {u < t}. Then by the divergence theorem

[formula]

Here we have used the global Lipschitz continuity of u, cf. [\cite=W].

The same results also hold for v and u - v, which we do not repeat here. Next we give a measure estimate for the transition part {u  ≤  T,v  ≤  T}.

For any T > 1, there exists a constant C(T) > 0, such that for any R > 1 and [formula],

[formula]

First we have the Claim. For each T > 1, there exists a c(T) > 0 such that, if x0∈{u  ≤  T,v  ≤  T}, then

[formula]

By assuming this claim, we get

[formula]

where in the last inequality we have used [\cite=W].

To prove the claim, first we note that, there exists a constant C1(T) such that

[formula]

Indeed, if (x0,{u = v})  ≥  L (L large to be chosen), take y0∈{u = v} to realize this distance and define

[formula]

Then by [\cite=W], there exits a vector e and a universal constant C, with

[formula]

such that

[formula]

where h(L) is small if L large enough.

Without loss of generality we can assume B1(L- 1(x0 - y0))  ⊂  {ũ  >  ṽ}. By a geometric consideration, we have

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

Thus u(x0) > T if L large, which is a contradiction.

After establishing [\eqref=2.3], we can use the standard Harnack inequality and [\cite=W] to deduce the claimed [\eqref=2.2].

There exists a constant C > 0, such that for any R > 1 and [formula],

[formula]

Fix a T > 0, which will be determined below. (It is independent of x and R.) We divide the estimate into three parts, {u  ≤  T,v  ≤  T}, {u > T} and {v > T}. Note that if T is large enough, by [\cite=W], these three parts are disjoint.

First in [formula], by the global Lipschitz continuity of u and v [\cite=W] and the previous lemma, we have

[formula]

If T large, in {u > T}, [formula] for a constant c(T) depending only on T (cf. the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem_measure_estimate_for_level_sets]). Furthermore, by the proof of [\cite=W], there exists a constant C such that

[formula]

Then by the co-area formula and Lemma [\ref=lem_measure_estimate_for_level_sets],

[formula]

The same estimate holds for {v > T}. Putting these together we can finish the proof.

There exists a constant C > 0, such that for any R > 1 and [formula],

[formula]

We still choose a T > 0, which will be determined below, and divide the estimate into three parts, {u  ≤  T,v  ≤  T}, {u > T} and {v > T}.

By the proof of [\cite=W], we still have

[formula]

Then in [formula],

[formula]

Next, by the proof of [\cite=W], there exists a constant C such that

[formula]

Then by the co-area formula and the lower bound of [formula] in {u > T} (i.e. [\eqref=2.0]),

[formula]

The same estimate holds for {v > T}. Putting these together we can finish the proof.

Blow up the stationary condition

In this section and the next one, we prove Theorem [\ref=thm_decay_estimate]. We argue by contradiction, so assume that as κ  →    +    ∞  , there exists a sequence of solutions (uκ,vκ) satisfying the conditions but not the conclusions in that theorem, that is,

[formula]

where e is a vector satisfying |e|  ≥  c0 (Without loss of generality, we can assume that [formula]), but for any vector ẽ satisfying (here the constant C(n) will be determined later)

[formula]

we must have (θ will be determined later)

[formula]

Moreover, we also assume that,

[formula]

We will derive a contradiction from these assumptions.

The first step, which will be done in this section, is to show that the blow up sequence

[formula]

converges to a harmonic function in some weak sense.

Recall that (uκ,vκ) satisfies the stationary condition

[formula]

Since there exists an R > 0 such that κ = R4, and

[formula]

by [\cite=W],

[formula]

Similarly, by Lemma [\ref=lem_2.3],

[formula]

Then by a direct expansion, we get

[formula]

Now let

[formula]

where λκ is chosen so that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and by noting [\eqref=mean_value_normalization] we can apply the Poincare inequality to get

[formula]

Hence after passing to a subsequence of κ, we can assume that wκ converges to w, weakly in H1(B1(0)) and strongly in L2(B1(0)).

Substituting wκ into [\eqref=stationary_condition_2], we obtain

[formula]

The last integral equals 0. Integrating by parts, we also have

[formula]

Substituting this into [\eqref=3.1], we obtain

[formula]

The right hand sides goes to 0 as [formula], thanks to our assumptions that [formula] and κ1 / 4εκ  →    +    ∞  . After passing to the limit in the above equality, we see

[formula]

Since Yn can be any function in C∞0(B1(0)), by standard elliptic theory we get

w is a harmonic function.

Strong convergence of the blow up sequence

In this section, we prove the strong convergence of wκ in H1loc(B1(0)). With some standard estimates on harmonic functions, this will give the decay estimate Theorem [\ref=thm_decay_estimate].

In order to prove the strong convergence of wκ in H1loc(B1(0)), we define the defect measure μ by

[formula]

By the weak convergence of wκ in H1(B1(0)), μ is a positive Radon measure. Furthermore, wκ converges strongly in H1loc(B1(0)) if and only if μ = 0 in B1(0).

First we note the fact that

The support of μ lies in the hyperplane {xn = 0}.

By [\cite=W] and [\eqref=assumption_1], as κ  →    +    ∞  , (uκ,vκ) converges to |e|(x+n,x-n) uniformly in B1(0). For any h > 0, if κ large,

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and by [\cite=C-T-V_3],

[formula]

Note that uκ and vκ are uniformly bounded in B1(0) because they are nonnegative, subharmonic. Then by definition

[formula]

uniformly in {xn  ≥  4|e|- 1h}, thanks to our assumption that εκ  ≫  κ- 1 / 8. Applying standard interior W2,2 estimates, together with the assumption [\eqref=assumption_1], and noting that wκ is uniformly bounded in H1loc(B1(0)), we see

[formula]

is uniformly bounded. By Rellich compactness theorem, [formula] converges to [formula] strongly in [formula]. In other words, the support of μ lies in {xn  ≤  5|e|- 1h}. We can get the other side estimate and also let [formula] to finish the proof.

For any η∈C∞0(B1(0)), by Lemma [\ref=lem_2.4] and [\cite=W],

[formula]

Substituting

[formula]

into this, we get

[formula]

On the other hand, by taking [formula] in [\eqref=2], we have

[formula]

Substituting this into [\eqref=1] we see

[formula]

Concerning the last term in this integral we claim that

For any η∈C∞0(B1(0)),

[formula]

By the definition of λκ (see [\eqref=mean_value_normalization]),

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=thm_preliminary], uκ - vκ converges uniformly on B1(0) to the harmonic function e  ·  x, thanks to the assumption that we always have (see the definition of uκ and vκ, [\eqref=scaled_solutions])

[formula]

This then implies that

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

On the other hand, by choosing the vector field [formula] in [\eqref=2], we have

[formula]

where we have used the uniform bound on [formula] and our assumption [\eqref=assumption_3].

Combining [\eqref=7] and [\eqref=8] we get the required convergence.

Note that [\eqref=assumption_3] says [formula]. An integration by parts in the first term in [\eqref=9] gives

[formula]

Next we analyze the convergence in [\eqref=3] term by term. By the weak convergence of [formula] and strong convergence of wκ in L2(B1(0)),

[formula]

By the weak convergence of [formula],

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here we have used Lemma [\ref=lem_support_of_defect_measure] and the fact that [formula] on {xn = 0}. Similarly, where μn is the weak limit of the measures [formula].

Substituting these into [\eqref=3] we get

[formula]

Since w is a harmonic function, an integration by parts gives

[formula]

Note that w is smooth. Then by standard domain variation arguments, we also have a stationary condition for w, which says, for any smooth vector field Y with compact support in B1(0),

[formula]

By taking [formula] in this equality, we obtain Substituting this and [\eqref=5] into [\eqref=4], we get

[formula]

By the weak convergence of wκ in H1(B1(0)), we also have

[formula]

[formula]

From these we see for any η∈C∞0(B1(0)),

[formula]

Substituting this into [\eqref=6], we see

[formula]

Since μ is a positive Radon measure, this implies that μ = 0, and hence the strong convergence of wκ in H1loc(B1(0)).

With these preliminary analysis we come to the

Note that w is a harmonic function satisfying

[formula]

By standard interior gradient estimates for harmonic functions, there exists a constant C1(n) depending only on the dimension n, such that for any r∈(0,1 / 2),

[formula]

Here we have used the fact that each component of [formula] is harmonic. By the mean value property for harmonic functions, there exists another constant C2(n) still depending only on the dimension n, such that

[formula]

With these choices, now we fix the constant C(n) in [\eqref=assumption_4] to be 2C2(n).

Fix a θ∈(0,1 / 2) so that

[formula]

Then by the strong convergence of wκ to w in H1(B1 / 2), for κ large,

[formula]

In other words,

[formula]

By our construction, [formula] satisfies [\eqref=assumption_4]. The above inequality contradicts [\eqref=assumption_2] and we finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_decay_estimate].
