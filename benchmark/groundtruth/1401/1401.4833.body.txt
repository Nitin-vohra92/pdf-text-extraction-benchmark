Abstract: In this note, we show how to apply the original L2-extension theorem of Ohsawa and Takegoshi to the standard basis of a multiplier ideal sheaf associated with a plurisubharmonic function. In this way, we are able to reprove the strong openness conjecture and to obtain an effective version of the semicontinuity theorem for weighted log canonical thresholds.

Introduction and main results

Let Ω be a domain in [formula] and φ in the set [formula] of plurisubharmonic functions on Ω. Following Demailly and Kollár [\cite=DK00], we introduce the log canonical threshold of φ at a point z0∈Ω

[formula]

It is an invariant of the singularity of φ at z0. We refer to [\cite=Ca12], [\cite=De93a], [\cite=De93b], [\cite=FEM03], [\cite=DH12], [\cite=DK00], [\cite=FEM10] [\cite=HHH12], [\cite=Hi13], [\cite=Ki94], [\cite=Na90], [\cite=PS00], [\cite=Sk72] for further information about this number. In [\cite=DK00], Demailly and Kollár stated the following openness conjecture. Conjecture. The set  [formula] equals the open interval  (0,cφ(z0)). In 2005, this conjecture was proved in dimension 2 by Favre and Jonsson ([\cite=FJ05], [\cite=JM12], [\cite=JM14]). In 2013, Berndtsson ([\cite=Be13]) completely proved it in arbitrary dimension. For every holomorphic function f on Ω, we introduce the weighted log canonical threshold of φ with weight f at z0:

[formula]

Recently, Guan-Zhou used a sophisticated version of the L2-extension theorem of Ohsawa and Takegoshi in combination with the curve selection lemma, to prove the "strong" openness conjecture, i.e. the analogue openness statement for weighted thresholds cφ,f(z0), and a related semi-continuity theorem for the weighted log canonical threshold ([\cite=GZ12], [\cite=GZ14]). In this note, we show how one can apply the original version [\cite=OT87] of the L2-extension theorem to the members of a standard basis for a multiplier ideal sheaf of holomorphic functions associated with a plurisubharmonic function φ. In this way, by means of a simple induction on dimension, we reprove the strong openness conjecture, and give an effective version of the semicontinuity theorem for weighted log canonical thresholds. The main results are contained in the following theorem. Main theorem. Let f be a holomorphic function on an open set Ω in [formula] and let [formula]. (i) ("Semicontinuity theorem") Assume that [formula] on some open subset Ω'  ⊂  Ω and let z0∈Ω'. Then for [formula], there exists δ  =  δ(c,φ,Ω',z0) > 0 such that ||ψ  -  φ||L1(Ω')  ≤  δ implies . Moreover, as ψ converges to φ in L1(Ω'), the function e- 2c  ψ converges to e- 2c  φ in L1 on every relatively compact open subset [formula]. (ii) ("Strong effective openness") Assume that [formula] on some open subset Ω'  ⊂  Ω. When [formula] converges to φ in L1(Ω') with ψ  ≤  φ, the function |f|2e- 2c  ψ converges to |f|2e- 2c  φ in L1 norm on every relatively compact open subset [formula]. Corollary 1.1 ("Strong openness"). For any plurisubharmonic function φ on a neighborhood of a point [formula], the set

[formula]

is an open interval (0,cφ,f(z0)). Corollary 1.2 ("Convergence from below"). If ψ  ≤  φ converges to φ in a neighborhood of [formula], then cψ,f(z0)  ≤  cφ,f(z0) converges to cφ,f(z0). In fact, after subtracting a large constant to φ, we can assume φ  ≤  0 in both corollaries. Then Cor. 1.1 is a consequence of assertion (ii) of the main theorem when we take Ω' small enough and ψ = (1 + δ)φ with [formula]. In Cor. 1.2, we have by definition cψ,f(z0)  ≤  cφ,f(z0) for ψ  ≤  φ, but again (ii) shows that cψ,f(z0) becomes[formula] for any given value c∈(0,cφ,f(z0)), whenever ||ψ  -  φ||L1(Ω') is sufficiently small. Remark 1.3. One cannot remove condition ψ  ≤  φ in assertion (ii) of the main theorem. Indeed, let us choose f(z) = z1, φ(z) =  log |z1| and [formula], for j  ≥  1. We have φj  →  φ in [formula], however cφj,f(0) = 1 < cφ,f(0) = 2 for all j  ≥  1. On the other hand, condition (i) does not require any given inequality between φ and ψ. Modulo Berndtsson's solution of the openness conjecture, (i) follows from the effective semicontinuity result of [\cite=DK00], but (like Guan and Zhou) we reprove here both by a direct and much easier method. Remark 1.4. As in Guan-Zhou [\cite=GZ13a], [\cite=GZ13b], one can reformulate Cor. 1.1 in terms of multiplier ideal sheaves. Denote by I(c  φ) the sheaf of germs of holomorphic functions [formula] such that [formula] on some neighborhood U of z (it is known by [\cite=Na90] that this is a coherent ideal sheaf over Ω, but we will not use this property here). Then at every point z∈Ω we have

[formula]

Proof of the main theorem

We equip the ring [formula] of germs of holomorphic functions at 0 with the homogeneous lexicographic order of monomials [formula], that is, [formula] if and only if [formula] or |α| = |β| and αi  <  βi for the first index i with [formula]. For each [formula] with [formula], j  ≥  1 and [formula], we define the initial coefficient, initial monomial and initial term of f to be respectively [formula], [formula], [formula], and the support of f to be [formula]. For any ideal I of [formula], we define [formula] to be the ideal generated by [formula]. First, we recall the division theorem of Hironaka and the concept of standard basis of an ideal. Division theorem of Hironaka (see [\cite=Ga79], [\cite=Ba82], [\cite=BM87], [\cite=BM89], [\cite=Ei95]). Let [formula]. Then there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

and [formula], where [formula] denotes the ideal generated by the family [formula]. Standard basis of an ideal. Let I be an ideal of [formula] and let [formula] be such that [formula]. Take f∈I. By the division theorem of Hironaka, there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

and [formula]. On the other hand, since [formula], we have . Therefore s = 0 and the gj's are generators of I. By permuting the gj's and performing ad hoc subtractions, we can always arrange that [formula], and we then say that [formula] is a standard basis of I. We will prove the main theorem by induction on dimension n. Of course, it holds for n = 0. Assume that the theorem holds for dimension n - 1. Thanks to the L2-extension theorem of Ohsawa and Takegoshi ([\cite=OT87]), we obtain the following key lemma. Lemma 2.1. Let φ  ≤  0 be a plurisubharmonic function and f be a holomorphic function on the polydisc ΔnR of center 0 and (poly)radius R > 0 in [formula], such that for some c > 0

[formula]

Let ψj  ≤  0, j  ≥  1, be a sequence of plurisubharmonic functions on ΔnR with ψj  →  φ in L1loc(ΔnR), and assume that either f = 1 identically or ψj  ≤  φ for all j  ≥  1. Then for every r < R and [formula], there exist a value [formula], an index j0, a constant  > c and a sequence of holomorphic functions Fj on Δnr, j  ≥  j0, such that [formula], [formula] with |wn||aj,α|  ≤  r- |α|ε for all [formula], and

[formula]

Moreover, one can choose wn in a set of positive measure in the punctured disc [formula] (the index j0 = j0(wn) and the constant   =  (wn) may then possibly depend on wn). Proof. By Fubini's theorem we have

[formula]

Since the integral extended to a small disc zn∈Δη tends to 0 as η  →  0, it will become smaller than any preassigned value, say ε20 > 0, for η  ≤  η0 small enough. Therefore we can choose a set of positive measure of values [formula] such that

[formula]

Since the main theorem is assumed to hold for n - 1, for any ρ < R there exist j0 = j0(wn) and   =  (wn) > c such that

[formula]

(For this, one applies part (i) in case f = 1, and part (ii) in case ψj  ≤  φ, using the fact that [formula] converges to φ as   →  c and j  →    +    ∞  ). Now, by the L2-extension theorem of Ohsawa and Takegoshi (see [\cite=OT87] or [\cite=De09]), there exists a holomorphic function Fj on Δn - 1ρ  ×  ΔR such that Fj(z',wn) = f(z',wn) for all z'∈Δn - 1ρ, and

[formula]

where Cn is a constant which only depends on n (the constant is universal for R = 1 and is rescaled by R2 otherwise). By the mean value inequality for the plurisubharmonic function |Fj|2, we get

[formula]

where Δρ(z) is the disc of center z and radius ρ. Hence, for any r < R, by taking [formula] we infer

[formula]

Since Fj(z',wn) - f(z',wn) = 0, [formula], we can write Fj(z) = f(z) + (zn - wn)gj(z) for some function [formula] on Δn - 1r  ×  ΔR. By (1), we get

[formula]

Thanks to the Cauchy integral formula, we find

[formula]

We take in any case [formula]. As [formula], this implies

[formula]

for some constant C' depending only on n,  r,  R and f. This yields the estimates of Lemma 2.1 for ε0: = C''ε with C'' sufficiently small. Finally, we prove that [formula]. Indeed, if [formula], since |wn||aj,α|  ≤  r- |α|ε, we can choose ε small enough such that [formula] and [formula]. Otherwise, if [formula], we have [formula].[formula] Proof of the main theorem. By well-known properties of (pluri)potential theory, the L1 convergence of ψ to φ implies that ψ  →  φ almost everywhere, and the assumptions guarantee that φ and ψ are uniformly bounded on every relatively compact subset of Ω'. In particular, after shrinking Ω' and subtracting constants, we can assume that φ  ≤  0 on Ω. Also, since the L1 topology is metrizable, it is enough to work with a sequence (ψj)j  ≥  1 converging to φ in L1(Ω'). Again, we can assume that ψj  ≤  0 and that ψj  →  φ almost everywhere on Ω'. By a trivial compactness argument, it is enough to show (i) and (ii) for some neighborhood Ω'' of a given point z0∈Ω'. We assume here z0 = 0 for simplicity of notation, and fix a polydisc ΔnR of center 0 with R so small that ΔnR  ⊂  Ω'. Then in the topology of L1(Δn - 1R) for almost every zn∈ΔR. Proof of statement (i). We have here [formula] for R > 0 small enough. By Lemma 2.1 with f = 1, for every r < R and ε > 0, there exist [formula], an index j0, a number  > c and a sequence of holomorphic functions Fj on Δnr, j  ≥  j0, such that [formula], |wn||aj,α|  r- |α|  ≤  ε and

[formula]

For [formula], we conclude that [formula] hence cψj(0)  ≥   > c and the first part of (i) is proved. In fact, after fixing such ε and wn, we even obtain the existence of a neighborhood Ω'' of 0 on which [formula], and thus get a uniform bound [formula]. The second assertion of (i) then follows from the estimate

[formula]

In fact the last two terms converge to 0 as A  →    +    ∞  , and, for A fixed, the first one in the right hand side converges to 0 by Lebesgue's bounded convergence theorem, as ψj  →  φ almost everywhere on Ω''.

Take [formula] such that [formula] is a standard basis of I(c  φ)0 with [formula], and ΔnR a polydisc so small that

[formula]

Since the germ of f at 0 belongs to the ideal [formula], we can essentially argue with the fl's instead of f. By Lemma 2.1, for every r < R and εl > 0, there exist [formula], an index j0 = j0(wn,l), a number   =  (wn,l) > c and a sequence of holomorphic functions Fj,l on Δnr, j  ≥  j0, such that [formula], |wn,l||aj,l,α|  r- |α|  ≤  εl and

[formula]

Since ψj  ≤  φ and  > c, we get Fj,l∈I(  ψj)0  ⊂  I(c  φ)0. The next step of the proof consists in modifying (Fj,l)1  ≤  l  ≤  k in order to obtain a standard basis of I(c  φ)0. For this, we proceed by selecting successively [formula] (and suitable [formula]). We have [formula], in particular [formula] is divisible by [formula] for some [formula]. Since [formula], we must have [formula] and thus [formula]. As |wn,1||aj,1,α|  ≤  ε1, we will have [formula] for ε1 small enough. Now, possibly after changing ε2 to a smaller value, we show that there exists a polynomial Pj,2,1 such that the degree and coefficients of Pj,2,1 are uniformly bounded, with [formula] and [formula]. We consider two cases: Case 1: If [formula], since |wn,2||aj,2,α|  ≤  r- |α|ε2, we can choose ε2 so small that [formula] and [formula]. We then take Pj,2,1 = 0. Case 2: If [formula], we have [formula]. Hence [formula] is divisible by [formula] for some [formula]. However, since [formula], the only possibility is that [formula] be divisible by [formula]. Take [formula] and [formula] such that [formula]. We have [formula] and

[formula]

can be taken arbitrarily small. Set [formula] and

[formula]

We have [formula]. Since |wn,2||b| = O(ε2) and |wn,2||aj,2,α| = O(ε2), we get |wn,2||ãj,2,α| = O(ε2) as well. Now, we consider two further cases. If [formula], we can again change ε2 for a smaller value so that [formula] and [formula]. Otherwise, if [formula], we have [formula]. Notice that is a finite set. By using similar arguments a finite number of times, we find ε2 so small that [formula] and [formula] for some polynomial Pj,2,1. Repeating the same arguments for [formula], we select inductively εl, [formula], and construct linear combinations [formula] with polynomials Pj,l,m, 1  ≤  m < l  ≤  k, possessing uniformly bounded coefficients and degrees, such that [formula] and [formula] for all [formula] and j  ≥  j0. This implies that [formula] is also a standard basis of I(c  φ)0. By Theorem 1.2.2 in [\cite=Ga79], we can find ρ,  so small that there exist holomorphic functions [formula] on Δnρ with ρ < r, such that

[formula]

and ||hj,l||L∞(Δnρ)  ≤  K||f||L∞(Δnr), for all [formula] (ρ and K only depend on [formula]). By (2), this implies a uniform bound

[formula]

for some  > c and all j  ≥  j0. Take Ω'' = Δnρ. We obtain the L1 convergence of |f|2e- 2c  ψj to |f|2e- 2c  φ almost exactly as we argued for the second assertion of part (i), by using the estimate
