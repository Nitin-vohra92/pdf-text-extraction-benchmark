Realistic shell-model calculations for isotopic chains "north-east" of 48Ca in the (N,Z) plane

Introduction

An interesting aspect of the physics of nuclei approaching the neutron drip line is the evolution of their shell structure. This topic is currently investigated in different mass regions, and the modern advances in the detection techniques and new experimental devices provide data that drive to a better understanding of the microscopic mechanism underlying modifications of the "magic numbers".

In this context, in the last decade it has been recognized the key role played by the tensor component of the residual two-body interaction between spin-orbit partner single-particle states [\cite=Otsuka01b] [\cite=Otsuka05] [\cite=Otsuka10b]. This may give rise to a breaking of shell closures leading to the possible appearance of the so-called "island of inversion", namely a region of nuclei where a rapid development of collectivity is observed. The best well-known example of this phenomenon is given by neutron-rich nuclei around 32Mg [\cite=Brown10].

The region of nuclei with valence protons outside doubly-closed 48Ca may be considered an interesting laboratory to study the shell evolution when adding neutrons, since there are long isotopic chains, such as those of iron and nickel isotopes, whose exoticity reaches an N / Z value of 1.79 in 78Ni.

As a matter of fact, it can be observed that the shell closure at N = 40 in 68Ni, corresponding to the filling of the neutron fp orbitals and of the proton f7 / 2 orbital, rapidly disappears when removing protons from f7 / 2, as testified by the behavior of the experimental excitation energies of the yrast Jπ = 2+ states in iron and chromium neutron-rich isotopes.

For this isotopic chains several experimental studies (see for example [\cite=Sorlin03] [\cite=Adrich08] [\cite=Ljungvall10] [\cite=Rother11] [\cite=Baugher12]) have found out that the disappeareance of the N = 40 shell closure comes along with the onset of a collective behavior, as indicated for instance by the observation of a rapid increase of the Ex(4+1) / Ex(2+1) ratio in 60 - 64Cr [\cite=Aoi09] [\cite=Gade10]. This has been related to the correlations between the quadrupole-partner neutron orbitals 0g9 / 2 and 1d5 / 2 [\cite=Zuker95] [\cite=Caurier02] [\cite=Lenzi10], so, within a shell-model description of these nuclei, the inclusion of the neutron 1d5 / 2 orbital should be needed.

It is worth pointing out that there is a general belief [\cite=Smirnova12] that shell-model effective interactions derived from realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials are defective in their monopole component, so that they are not able to provide a good description of the evolution of spectroscopic properties along the isotopic chains, unless including contributions from three-nucleon forces [\cite=Schwenk06] [\cite=Holt13].

On these grounds, we have found it challenging to perform realistic shell-model calculations [\cite=Coraggio09a] for some isotopic chains north-east of 48Ca, starting from the high-precision CD-Bonn NN potential renormalized by way of the so-called Vlow - k approach [\cite=Bogner01] [\cite=Bogner02]. In particular, in order to explore the microscopic processes leading to the disappearance of the N = 40 shell closure and the onset of collectivity, we have derived two effective shell-model interactions for two different model spaces. The first one, which is spanned by the proton 0f7 / 2 and 1p3 / 2 orbitals and by the neutron 1p3 / 2, 1p1 / 2, 0f5 / 2, 0g9 / 2 orbitals, is able, as we show in the following, to reproduce the dropping of the N = 40 magic number in iron and chromium isotopes as well as many other spectroscopic properties of nuclei north-east of 48Ca. The second one is spanned by the same orbitals plus the neutron 1d5 / 2. The calculations within the latter model space are able to reproduce the onset of collectivity in heavy iron and chromium isotopes, at the same time preserving the results obtained with the first model space.

In the following section, we outline the perturbative approach to the derivation of our shell-model hamiltonians and effective charges of the electric quadrupole operators. In Section III, we present the results of our calculations for calcium, titanium, chromium, iron, and nickel isotopes. Concluding remarks are given in the last section. In the Appendix, we report the calculated two-body matrix elements (TBME) of the effective shell-model interactions, the employed single-particle (SP) energies, and the effective charges of the E2 operator.

Outline of calculations

Within the framework of the shell model, an auxiliary one-body potential U is introduced in order to break up the hamiltonian for a system of A nucleons as the sum of a one-body term H0, which describes the independent motion of the nucleons, and a residual interaction H1:

[formula]

Once H0 has been introduced, it is possible to define a reduced model space in terms of a finite subset of H0's eigenvectors. In this space, an effective hamiltonian Heff may be constructed and the diagonalization of the many-body hamiltonian ([\ref=smham]) in an infinite Hilbert space is then reduced to the solution of an eigenvalue problem in a finite space.

As mentioned in the Introduction, we derive effective shell-model hamiltonians Heff for two model spaces outside 48Ca core. The first one (I) is spanned by the two single-proton levels 0f7 / 2, 1p3 / 2 and the four single-neutron levels 1p3 / 2,1p1 / 2, 0f5 / 2, 0g9 / 2, while the second one (II) includes also the neutron 1d5 / 2 orbital.

To this end, the following approach has been employed: first we have derived a Heff defined in a very large model space outside the 40Ca closed core and spanned by six proton and neutron pfgd orbitals. Then, we derive from this Heff two new effective hamiltonians, defined in the smaller model spaces (I) and (II). The above double-step procedure ensures that, when the 1d5 / 2 orbital is irrelevant to describe the physics of certain nuclear states, the eigenvalues obtained using model space (I) or (II) are the same or at least very close to each other.

The derivation of both Heffs has been done in the framework of the time-dependent perturbation theory by way of the Kuo-Lee-Ratcliff (KLR) folded-diagram expansion [\cite=Kuo90]. More precisely, we first renormalize the high-momentum repulsive components of the CD-Bonn NN potential by way of the Vlow - k approach [\cite=Bogner01] [\cite=Bogner02] with a momentum cutoff Λ = 2.6 fm- 1, which provides a smooth potential preserving exactly the on-shell properties of the original NN potential. Next, we express Heff in terms of the vertex function [formula]-box, which is composed of irreducible valence-linked diagrams [\cite=Kuo71] [\cite=Kuo81]. In the derivation of the [formula]-box we have included one- and two-body Goldstone diagrams through third order in H1 [\cite=Coraggio12a]. Since calculations beyond the third order in perturbation theory are computationally prohibitive, we have calculated the Padé approximant

[formula]

Results

In this section, we report the results of our shell-model calculations for calcium, titanium, chromium, iron and nickel isotopes with mass number A  >  48, and compare them with the available experimental data. As mentioned in the Introduction, our attention is focused on the insurgence of collective behavior or shell-closure properties when adding valence neutrons.

The calculations have been performed by using the Oslo shell-model code [\cite=EngelandSMC].

Calcium isotopes

A major topic in nuclear physics is the understanding of the shell evolution towards the neutron dripline, and in this context the study of calcium isotopes provides an interesting laboratory [\cite=Gridnev06] [\cite=Capelli09] [\cite=Duguet12] [\cite=Hagen12] [\cite=Holt13].

An extensive study of the heavy calcium isotopes have been reported in Ref. [\cite=Coraggio09c], where we have performed a shell-model calculation using 40Ca as an inert core and the full fp shell as model space. As in the present paper, the effective interaction has been obtained from a Vlow - k derived from the CD-Bonn potential with a cutoff momentum equal to 2.6 ~ fm- 1. The results we have obtained are in excellent agreement with the experimental data, in particular we have successfully predicted the excitation energy of the yrast J = 2+ in 54Ca, that only recently has been measured at RIKEN [\cite=Steppenbeck13].

In Fig. [\ref=J02p_Ca] are reported the excitation energies of the yrast 2+ states calculated with model spaces (I) and (II) as a function of the neutron number up to N = 52 and compared with the available experimental data and the results obtained by our previous calculations with the full fp-shell model space.

It can be seen that the available observed energies are well reproduced for N = 30,32, the three calculations providing almost the same values. At N = 34,36 the results with model spaces (I) and (II) differ from those of Ref. [\cite=Coraggio09c], and are almost indistinguishable up to N = 48. We have verified that to reproduce the observed drop in energy at N = 34 it is necessary, as in Ref. [\cite=Coraggio09c], to include explicitly the neutron 0f7 / 2 orbital into the model space. On the other hand, the different results obtained at N = 36 trace back to the presence in model spaces (I) and (II) of the 0g9 / 2 orbital that starts to fill just at N = 36. As a matter of fact, we have verified that, when blocking out this orbital, the calculated excitation energy of the yrast 2+ state drops abruptly down at 0.7 MeV.

This suggests that to optimize the description of the calcium isotopic chain one has to adopt a model space spanned by the full fp shell plus the 0g9 / 2 orbital. From the inspection of Fig. [\ref=J02p_Ca], it can be seen that no shell closure shows up at N = 40, since the 0g9 / 2 SP energy is very close to the pf ones, while the large energy gap between 0g9 / 2 and 1d5 / 2 orbitals is responsible for a strong shell closure at N = 50 and that according to our calculations 70Ca should be the last bound calcium isotope. This picture is confirmed when looking at the behavior of the calcium effective single-particle energies (ESPE), as reported in Fig. [\ref=ESPE_Ca].

Titanium isotopes

The calculated excitation energies of the yrast 2+ states and the B(E2;2+1  →  0+1) transition rates for titanium isotopes are reported in Fig. [\ref=J02p_Ti] up to N = 40. It can be seen that the observed excitation energies and B(E2)s are well reproduced by both calculations.

The decrease of the experimental 2+1 excitation energy in 56Ti is linked to the lack of a N = 34 shell closure, as we predicted in [\cite=Coraggio09c] and confirmed by the recent observation of the excitation energy of Jπ = 2+1 state in 54Ca [\cite=Steppenbeck13]. From the inspection of Fig. [\ref=J02p_Ti], it can be observed that the calculated 2+1 excitation energies are almost insensitive to the inclusion of the 1d5 / 2 orbital. This does not happen with the B(E2)s, whose calculated values begin to differ substantially starting from N = 36 on. In particular, using model space (I) the increase of the number of valence neutrons corresponds to a rise of the proton 0f7 / 2 occupation number and to the decrease of the proton polarization, at variance with model space (II) where the occupation of this orbital is almost constant respect to the neutron number N (see Table [\ref=occupations]). This comes with a significant larger occupation of the neutron 0g9 / 2 orbital with model space (II) with respect to model space (I), as well as an increase of the neutron 1d5 / 2-orbital occupation that provides a constant rise of the corresponding B(E2)s up to N = 40.

Chromium isotopes

The excitation energies of the yrast 2+ states and B(E2;2+1  →  0+1) transition rates for the chromium isotopes are reported in Fig. [\ref=J02p_Cr] up to N = 40. It is worth mentioning that the observed lowering of the yrast 2+ states starting from N = 34 is interpreted as a signature of the development of a pronounced collectivity towards N = 40 [\cite=Gade10]. The interpretation of such a collective behavior may be framed within the quasi-SU(3) approximate symmetry owing to the interplay between the quadrupole-quadrupole component of the residual interaction and the central field in the sub-space spanned by the lowest Δj=2 orbitals of a major shell [\cite=Zuker95]. In this connection, the need to include the neutron 1d5 / 2 orbital in a shell-model calculation, in order to produce the onset of collectivity around N = 40 in chromium isotopes, has been evidenced by Caurier, Nowacki, and Poves in Ref. [\cite=Caurier02]. Also our results support the crucial role played by this orbital. In fact, from the inspection of Fig. [\ref=J02p_Cr] it can be observed that using model space (I) from 58Cr to 60Cr the calculated Jπ = 2+1 states start to rise in excitation energy, while the experimental behavior does the opposite. Actually, employing the model space (II) there is a decrease of the 2+ excitation energy from N = 34 to N = 36. From the inspection of Table [\ref=occupations], we see that the appearance of the differencies between model-space (I) and (II) results come together with an abrupt increase of the occupation number of the neutron 1d5 / 2, ~ 0g9 / 2 orbitals and a depletion of the proton 0f7 / 2 one. This has to be ascribed to a reduced neutron gap between 0g9 / 2  -  0f5 / 2 (about 2.5 MeV) effective single-particle energies (ESPE) with respect to the one in Ni isotopes (about 4.0 MeV), where a shell closure is found at N = 40 (see Sec. [\ref=conclusions]), as well as to the quadrupole-quadrupole component of the effective interaction between the 1d5 / 2 and the 0g9 / 2 orbitals.

Another feature that reveals the onset of the collectivity in chromium isotopes is the rise of the experimental B(E2;2+1  →  0+1) transition rates from N = 34 to N = 38. This can be reproduced only by calculations with model space (II), as can be seen in Fig. [\ref=J02p_Cr], where the experimental data are compared with our shell-model results with both model spaces.

In Fig. [\ref=J04p_Cr] the calculated and experimental excitation energies of the yrast 4+ states are also reported, evidencing that only with model space (II) it is possible to reproduce the observed increase of the Ex(4+1) / Ex(2+1) ratio from 60Cr to 62Cr.

Iron isotopes

In Fig. [\ref=J02p_Fe] the 2+1 excitation energies and B(E2;2+1  →  0+1) transition rates of even iron isotopes are shown as a function of the neutron number up to N = 40. It should be mentioned that experimental data are available for 68Fe too [\cite=Crawford13], but they are not reported since for this nucleus calculations performed with model space (II) need a CPU time which exceeds our present computational resources.

A relevant feature that can be inferred from Fig. [\ref=J02p_Fe] is the abrupt enhancement of the B(E2;2+1  →  0+1) in 64Fe [\cite=Ljungvall10] [\cite=Rother11] [\cite=Crawford13] that, as in chromium isotopes, is the evidence of the onset of a quadrupole collectivity. This is at variance with the results of calculations with model space (I), that show a decrease of the B(E2;2+1  →  0+1) from 62Fe to 64Fe. Actually, the onset of the above mentioned quadrupole collectivity is reproduced using model space (II), and, as in Ti and Cr isotopes, comes with a rise of the occupation number of the neutron 0g9 / 2 orbital (see Table [\ref=occupations]). It has to be pointed out, however, that the experimental datum in 64Fe [\cite=Rother11] is underestimated.

Nickel isotopes

The nickel isotopes represent a very interesting laboratory to study the effects of the NN interaction on the shell evolution, when increasing the number of valence neutrons. In fact, this is a very long isotopic chain with available spectroscopic data from N = 24 up to N = 48, and several efforts are at present devoted to get as much experimental information as possible on 78Ni, which is a possible waiting point for r - process nucleosyntesis [\cite=Hosmer05]. In Fig. [\ref=J02p_Ni] they are reported the experimental data and the results of our shell-model calculations with model spaces (I) and (II) for the 2+1 excitation energy and the B(E2,2+1  →  0+1) systematics from N = 28 to N = 50.

As already mentioned in the Introduction, it can be seen that the filling of the proton 0f7 / 2 orbital, corresponding to the well-known Z = 28 closure, produces the disappearance of the collectivity towards N = 40 observed in chromium and iron isotopes. The peak of the yrast 2+ excitation energy and the fall of the corresponding B(E2) in 68Ni is a clear manifestation of the shell closure at N = 40, which is added to the ones at N = 28 and N = 50 in this long isotopic chain. As a matter of fact, it turns out that our calculated neutron ESPE provide a large gap between the 0g9 / 2 and fp orbitals (see Fig. [\ref=ESPE]). This implies a minor role played by the correlations between the quadrupole partners 0g9 / 2, ~ 1d5 / 2, as supported by the fact that the calculations with model space (I) and (II) give similar occupation numbers (see Table [\ref=occupations]), as well as the same behavior for the Ex(2+1) and the electric-quadrupole transition rates (see Fig. [\ref=J02p_Ni]). It is interesting to note that recently the B(E2) in 74Ni has been measured in a Coulomb excitation experiment [\cite=Marchi13], the obtained value being significantly smaller than the one measured indirectly via a (p,p') inhelastic diffusion [\cite=Aoi10]. Our values of the B(E2)s for 74Ni are close to the recently measured one. They, however, do not reproduce the decrease in the B(E2) from N = 42 to N = 46 since the 70Ni B(E2) is significantly underestimated. More precisely, we predict an increase of the B(E2) from N = 40 to 42 but not as large as the observed one. This may be traced to the fact that our proton model space leaves out the 0f5 / 2 orbital, which has a relevant role beyond N = 40 as evidenced by the behavior of the yrast [formula] states in odd-mass Cu isotopes [\cite=nndc]. As a matter of fact, for Ni isotopes with N > 40 the attraction due to the tensor force between the neutron 0g9 / 2 and the proton 0f5 / 2 orbitals may give rise to a lowering of the latter leading to a strong core polarization with a consequent increase of the B(E2)s. It is worth mentioning, however, that shell-model calculations that include explicitly the proton 0f5 / 2 orbital show the same behavior of the B(E2) as ours [\cite=Shimizu12].

Finally, it has to be observed that, because of the magicity at N = 50, the yrast J = 2+ state in 78Ni is built up breaking a couple of protons in the filled 0f7 / 2 orbital and promoting one proton into the 1p3 / 2 orbital. This mechanism is then responsible of the increase of the theoretical B(E2;2+  →  0+) with respect to neighboring nuclei.

Concluding remarks

We have presented here the results of an extensive shell-model study of nuclei north-east of 48Ca within the framework of a microscopic approach. This means that, starting from a Vlow - k derived from the CD-Bonn NN potential, effective two-body interactions and effective electromagnetic multipole operators have been calculated by way of perturbation theory and then employed in shell-model calculations.

As mentioned in the Introduction, this region is currently the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations, especially because of the behavior of the quadrupole collectivity at N = 40 versus the atomic number, as can be inferred from the inspection of Fig. [\ref=J02p_N40].

In this context, we have focused attention on the role played by the neutron 1d5 / 2 orbital in the spectroscopy of the nuclei under investigation, using two different model spaces which differ only by the inclusion of this SP state.

Our results are in a better agreement with experiment when using the larger model space, in line with other large-scale shell-model calculations [\cite=Kaneko08] [\cite=Lenzi10] [\cite=Poves12] [\cite=Shimizu12] where the TBME were determined empirically. This confirms the ability of realistic shell-model calculations to provide a reliable microscopic description of the shell evolution along isotopic chains, even in presence of strong collective features. In fact, results with model spaces (I) and (II) are similar only for Ni isotopes, evidencing the relevance of including the neutron 1d5 / 2 orbital to describe the collective properties of Ti, Cr, and Fe isotopic chains. The role played by 1d5 / 2 may be explained in terms of correlations between this orbital and its quadrupole partner 0g9 / 2, which comes into play because of the reduction of the 0f5 / 2 - 0g9 / 2 gap.

To clarify the above considerations, our results can be resumed reporting in Figs. [\ref=ESPE],[\ref=J02p_N40] the ESPE, as well as the energies of the yrast 2 +  states and the B(E2;2+  →  0 + s, at N = 40 as a function of Z, respectively. From the inspection of Fig. [\ref=J02p_N40], it can be clearly seen that the nature of the yrast 2+ states changes with the filling of the proton 0f7 / 2 orbital, tuning the collectivity at N = 40.

It has to be stressed that our calculations employ only a two-body Vlow - k, derived from the high-precision CD-Bonn potential, not taking into account any three-body forces. Therefore, the good quality of the agreement between theory and experiment seems to question the role of valence three-body forces in the description of the spectroscopic properties of intermediate-mass nuclei.
