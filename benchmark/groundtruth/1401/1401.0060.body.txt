Slicing a 2-sphere

Definition Lemma Proposition Corollary

Introduction

Let M be a Reiamannian 2-sphere. Denote the area of M by |M|. In this paper we consider the problem of slicing M by short curves.

We start with the following isoperimetric problem: when is it possible to subdivide M into two regions of relatively large area by a short simple closed curve?

Papasoglu [\cite=P] used Besicovitch inequality to show that there exists a simple closed curve of length [formula] subdividing M into two regions of area [formula]. A similar result was independently proved by Balacheff and Sabourau [\cite=BS] using a variation of Gromov's filling argument.

On the other hand, consider the 3-legged starfish example on Figure [\ref=starfish].

As it has been observed in [\cite=S], for any [formula], if the tentacles are sufficiently thin and long, the length of the shortest simple closed curve subdividing M into two regions of area ≥  r|M| can be arbitrarily large. A. Nabutovsky asked ([\cite=N]) the following question: what is the maximal value of r∈[null] such that for some c(r) each Riemannian 2-sphere of area 1 can be subdivided into two discs of area ≥  r by a simple closed curve of length ≤  c(r)?

Our first result provides an answer for this question.

There exists a simple closed curve γ of length [formula] subdividing M into two subdiscs of area [formula].

To prove Theorem [\ref=1/3_area] we obtain the following result of independent interest.

There exists a map f from M into a trivalent tree T, such that fibers of f have length [formula] and controlled topology: preimage of every interior point is a simple closed curve, preimage of every terminal vertex is a point and preimage of every vertex of degree 3 is homeomorphic to the greek letter θ.

Theorem [\ref=tree] follows from a more general Theorem [\ref=tree1] in Section 3 for spheres with k  ≥  0 holes. Using different methods Guth [\cite=G] proved existence of a map from M into a trivalent tree with lengths of fibers bounded in terms of hypersphericity of M. It follows from Theorem 0.3 in [\cite=G] that there exists such a map with fibers of length [formula].

The second main result of this paper is about slicing M by 1 - cycles. If instead of simple closed curves we allow subdividison by 1-cycles, we show that M can be subdivided into two regions with arbitrary prescribed ratio of areas by a 1-cycle of length [formula]. In fact, we prove the following

There exists a Morse function [formula] with fibers of length [formula].

This improves the result of Balacheff and Sabourau [\cite=BS] that there exists a sweep-out of M by 1 - cycles of length [formula].

Theorem [\ref=morse] follows from a more general result in Section 4, where we prove existence of a Morse function on a sphere with k holes, such that the function is constant on each connected component of the boundary and the length of fibers are bounded in terms of area and boundary length.

Alvarez Paiva, Balacheff and Tzanev [\cite=ABT] show that existence of a Morse function on a Riemannian 2-sphere with bounded fibers yields a length-area inequality for the shortest periodic geodesic on a Finsler 2-sphere (for both reversible and non-reversible metrics). Note that arguments used by Croke [\cite=C] to prove the length-area bound for the shortest closed geodesic on a Riemannian 2-sphere (see also [\cite=R] for the best known constant) can not be directly generalized to the Finsler case because co-area inequality fails for non-reversible Finsler metrics.

Hence, Theorem [\ref=morse] yields a better constant for Theorem VI in [\cite=ABT].

Let M be a Finsler two-sphere with Holmes-Thompson area A. Then M carries a closed geodesic of length [formula].

The reason for constants 26 and 52 in our theorems is the following. We obtain the desired slicing of the sphere by repeatedly using the result of Papasoglu [\cite=P] to subdivide the sphere into smaller regions by a curve of length at most [formula] times the square root of the area of the region. At each step the area of the region reduces at least by a factor of [formula]. We then assemble these subdividing curves into one foliation with lengths bounded by the geometric progression

[formula]

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=morse] some subdividng curves are used twice so an additional factor of 2 appears.

After the first subdivision happens our regions are no longer spheres, but rather spheres with a finite number of holes. It may not be possible to find a short simple closed curve subdividing it into two parts of area [formula] of its area. Instead we may have to use a collection of arcs with endpoints on the boundary subdividng the region into many pieces, each of small area. The issue is then how to assemble all of these subdividing curves into one foliation.

The main technical result of this paper (proved in the next section, see Proposition [\ref=subdivision]) is that we can always choose these subdividing arcs in such a way that they belong to a single connected component of the boundary of a certain subregion A1 with area of A1 between [formula] and [formula] of the area of the region. This result make assembling curves into one foliation a straightforward procedure.

After the first version of this article appeared on the web, F. Balacheff in [\cite=B] improved constant 26 in Theorems 1 and 2 to 7.6, and constant 160 in Theorem 4 to 31.1, but not constant 52 in Theorem 3.

Subdivision by short curves

Let M be a Riemannian 2-sphere. For [formula] let Sr(M) denote the set of simple closed curves on M that divide it into subdiscs of area ≥  r|M|. Define c(M,r)  =   inf γ∈Sr(M)|γ| and c(r) =  sup c(M,r), where the supremum is taken over all metrics on S2 of area 1.

By definition c(r) is increasing and by Proposition [\ref=semicontinuity] below it is lower semicontinuous. For any [formula] it follows from the example in the introduction (see Figure [\ref=starfish]) that c(r)  =    ∞  . For [formula] we have the following result of Papasoglu.

(Papasoglu, [\cite=P]) [formula]

We will need to generalize Theorem [\ref=papasoglu] to spheres with finitely many holes and allow a larger class of subdividing curves than just simple closed curves. When the surface has boundary we will allow the subdividing curve γ to consist of several arcs with endpoints on the boundary. In this case we will define a distinguished connected component A1 of [formula] and require that γ is contained in a connected component of ∂A1. This is a technical condition that will make it easer to repeatedly cut the surface into smaller pieces and concatenate the subdivding curves to obtain a slicing of M.

Let Mk be a complete Riemannian 2-surface with boundary homeomorphic to a sphere with k holes. Let γ be a simple closed curve in the interior of Mk or a union of finitely many arcs [formula], where γi are arcs with endpoints on ∂Mk that do not pairwise intersect and have no self-intersections. Let {Ai} be the set of connected components of [formula]. Let SMk(r) denote the set of all such γ on Mk that in addition satisfy

r|Mk|  ≤  |A1|  ≤  (1 - r)|Mk|

γ is contained in a connected component of ∂A1

In particular, (1) implies that the area of every connected component of [formula] is bounded from above by (1 - r)Mk.

Define c(Mk,r)  =   inf γ∈Sr(Mk)|γ| and ck(r) =  sup c(Mk,r), where the supremum is taken over all metrics on a sphere with k holes that have area 1.

We have the following useful fact.

ck(r) and c(r) are lower semi-continuous for [formula].

We prove the result for ck(r) and for c(r) it will follow as a special case from the argument below.

Let {rn} be an increasing sequence converging to r for some [formula]. Fix ε > 0. Let Mk be a complete Riemannian surface of area 1 diffeomorphic to a sphere with k holes. We would like to show that for some rn there exists γ∈Sr(Mk) with |γ|  ≤  ck(rn) + ε.

We can find δ > 0 small enough so that it satisfies the following requirements:

The area of the δ-tubular neighbourhood of ∂M satisfies [formula].

Any ball Bδ(x) around x∉Nδ(∂Mk) is bilipschitz diffeomorphic to the Euclidean disc of radius δ with Lipschitz constant between 0.99 and 1.01. In particular, 3δ2  <  |Bδ(x)| < 4δ2 and |∂Bδ(x)|  <  8δ.

[formula]

For such a δ choose rn so that r - rn < (1 - r)δ2. Let γ∈SMk(rn) be the subdividing arcs of length ≤  ck(rn)  +  ε / 2. In the following argument it will be more convenient to consider γ', the connected component of ∂A1 that contains γ (recall that by definition of ck(r) γ lies in a single boundary component of ∂A1). If γ is a closed curve then γ'  =  γ. If γ is a union of arcs then γ' is a closed curve made out of arcs of γ and arcs of ∂M.

Let B1 denote the element of [formula] of smaller area and B2 denote the element of larger area. We can assume that |B1| < r for otherwise we are done. Therefore, we have rn  ≤  |B1| < r and 1 - r < |B2|  ≤  1 - rn.

Let M' denote [formula]. By our choice of δ we have that the area of a ball |Bδ(x)|  ≥  3δ2 for x∈M' and [formula]. By Fubini's theorem we obtain [formula]. Hence, for some x∈M' we have [formula]. Since [formula] is non-empty we can always find such a ball so that [formula] is non-empty.

We will now construct a new curve β that coincides with γ' outside of B1.1δ(x) and divides Mk into regions B1' and B2' so that one of them is connected and each of them has area ≥  r. Moreover, |β|  <  |γ'|  +  ε / 2. This implies the desired inequality c(r,Mk)  ≤  c(rn,Mk) + ε.

We construct β by cutting γ' at the points of intersection with ∂Bδ(x) and attaching arcs of ∂Bδ(x). We do it in such a way that Bδ(x) is now entirely contained in the smaller of two regions. This increases the area of the smaller region by at least (1 - r)δ2 and increases the length of the subdividing curve by at most 2|∂Bδ(x)|  ≤  16δ  <  ε / 2.

The procedure is illustrated in Figure [\ref=semicontinuity]. Let {Cj} be connected components of [formula] and {cji} denote connected components of [formula]. First we erase all arcs of γ' that are in Bδ(x). For each j we erase the arc cj1 from ∂Bδ(x). For each cji, i  >  1, we add a copy of cji and perturb it so that the new curve β does not intersect Bδ(x) in the neighbourhood of cji. This does not increase the number of connected components of either region.

The only example that I know where upper semicontinuity of c(r) fails is the three-legged starfish on Figure [\ref=starfish] (showing c(r)  =    ∞   for [formula], while c(1 / 3)  ≤  26 by Theorem [\ref=1/3_area]). The following question seems natural:

Question Is c(r) continuous for [formula]?

It can be easily shown from the definition that c(r)  ≤  ck(r). Under the additional assumption [formula] we are able to prove that they are equal.

Suppose [formula], then ck(r) = c(r).

In the proof of Proposition [\ref=subdivision] we will use the following topological fact.

Let M be a submanifold (with boundary) of S2 and let γ be a simple closed curve in S2. Suppose the intersection of γ and ∂M is non-empty and transversal. If A denotes a connected component of [formula] then there exists an arc a  ⊂  γ and an arc b  ⊂  ∂M, such that [formula] bounds a disc [formula] and [formula] is connected.

The proof of this Lemma is the main technical part of the paper. The proof is illustrated on Figure [\ref=2gon_fig]. The reader can draw several pictures like on Figure [\ref=2gon_fig] and convince him or herself that the statement is correct.

The strategy of the proof is to find some disc [formula], with possibly a large number of components of [formula]. We then show that there exists a subdisc of [formula] whose intersection with M has a smaller number of connected components.

Let [formula] and C1 be the connected component of ∂M that contains p1.

Define an interval b1  ⊂  C1 to be a connected component of [formula] that has p1 as an enpoint (note that it is unique). We denote the other endpoint of b1 by q1. Let v be a tangent vector to γ at p1 pointing inside M. Let a1 be an arc of γ that starts at p1 in the direction v and ends at q1.

Observe that the curve [formula] is a simple closed curve enclosing a disc [formula] that contains a non-empty subset of [formula]. If [formula] has one connected component then we are done. Assume it has more than one. Let A1 be a component of [formula] with b1  ⊂  ∂A1 and let A2 be a different component. Define a point p2∈a1 by

[formula]

It follows from the definition that p2∈∂M. We can find a point [formula] and an arc [formula] from p2 to q2.

The interior of [formula] is contained in the interior of [formula]. It follows that q2∈a1. Denote the arc of a1 between p2 and q2 by a2. We have that [formula] separates S2 into a disc [formula] that contains A2 and its complement that contains A1. Set [formula]. It is non-empty and has fewer connected components than [formula]. We iterate this procedure until we are left with just one connected component.

We now prove Proposition [\ref=subdivision].

The direction c(r)  ≤  ck(r) is simple. Given a Riemannian 2-sphere we can make k holes in it of small area and small boundary length. We subdivide the resulting sphere with holes and use the fact that the connected component of ∂A1 that contains γ will have length close to ck(r). Here we did not use that [formula].

To prove the other direction we proceed as follows. Let ε be a small positive constant. Given a sphere with k holes Mk of area 1 we attach k discs of total area ε to the boundary of Mk. We obtain a Riemannian 2-sphere M.

Let γ1 be a simple closed curve of length ≤  cr(M)  +  ε subdividing M into two subdiscs A and B of area between r(1 + ε) and (1 - r)(1 + ε). Suppose A is a subdisc of area [formula]. If γ1 is disjoint from ∂Mk we conclude that [formula].

Suppose γ1 intersects ∂Mk. By Lemma [\ref=2-gon] there exists an arc a1 of γ1 and an arc b1 of ∂Mk, such that [formula] is connected.

We consider two possibilities. First, suppose |A1|  ≥  r(1 + ε). Let γ2 be the intersection of a1 with the interior of Mk. A1 is a connected component of [formula] of area between r - ε and 1 - r  +  ε. The rest of connected components of [formula] have area less than 1 - r  +  ε. So c(Mk,r - ε)  ≤  cr(M)  +  ε.

Alternatively, suppose |A1|  <  r(1 + ε). In this case we can define a new curve γ2, such that the number of connected components of [formula] is smaller than the number of connected components of [formula]. We do this by replacing the arc a1 of γ1 by b1  ⊂  ∂Mk. Note that we can slightly perturb the part of the new curve that coincides with b1 so that it is entirely in [formula], in particular, the intersection of γ2 with ∂Mk is transversal and the length of the intersection of γ2 with the interior of Mk is smaller than that of γ1. As a result we transferred the area of A1 from A to B. Since |A1| < r(1 + ε), [formula] and [formula] we obtain that the area of each of the two discs [formula] is at least r(1 + ε). In this way we can continue reducing the number of connected components of [formula] until one of the subdiscs of [formula] contains only one connected component of Mk or until we encounter the first possibility above.

By Proposition [\ref=semicontinuous] we conclude that ck(r)  ≤  c(r).

T-maps

A map f from Mk to a trivalent tree T is called a T-map if the topology of fibers of f is controlled in the following way: the preimage of any point in an edge of T is a circle, there exist k terminal vertices xk∈T, such that f- 1(xk) is a connected component of ∂Mk, the preimage of any other terminal point of T is a point, and the preimage of a trivalent vertex of T is homeomorphic to the greek letter θ.

For [formula] and any ε > 0 there exists a T - map f from Mp, p  ≥  0, so that each fiber of the map has length less than [formula].

Theorem [\ref=tree] follows by taking [formula] and applying Theorem [\ref=papasoglu].

In the proof we will repeatedly use the following simple fact, so it is convenient to state it as a separate lemma.

Let A1 and A2 be two closed smooth submanifolds (with boundary) of Mp, such that [formula] is a connected arc. Let ci denote the connected component of ∂Ai that contains α. Suppose [formula] and that each Ai admits a T - map with fibers of length <  L, then [formula] admits a T - map with fibers of length ≤  L.

From the assumption that Ai admits a T - map it follows that there exists an embedded cylinder Ci  ⊂  Ai and a map fi:Ci  →  [0,1] with fiber f- 1(0) = ci and the length of all fibers <  L. The boundary [formula] with ci' contained in the interior of Ai.

Let a1 and a2 be the endpoints of α. For a sufficiently small δ > 0 we perform a surgery on the the closed curves in the foliation {f- 1i(t)|0  ≤  t  ≤  δ}. The surgery happens in the δ  -  neighbourhood of ai and is depicted on Figure [\ref=concat_fig].

As a result of the surgery we obtain three families of curves. The "outer" family converging to [formula], and two "inner" families each converging to c1' or c2'. These three families are separated by a θ graph (drawn in red on Figure [\ref=concat_fig]). This surgery defines the desired T - map.

We will need first a version of Theorem [\ref=tree1] for very small balls.

For any ε  >  0 there exists l > 0, such that for every disc D  ⊂  Mp with |∂D|  ≤  l there exists a diffeomorphism f from D to the standard closed disc Dst  =  {x2 + y2  ≤  1} so that the preimage of each concentric circle f- 1({x2 + y2  =  const}), has length ≤  (1 + ε)|∂D|.

For δ > 0 sufficiently small every ball B  ⊂  Mp of radius δ is (1 + ε) - bilipschitz diffeomorphic to a disc in the closed upper half-plane [formula].

Let D' denote the image of D under such a diffeomorphism. (Here we are assuming that l < δ and D is contained within a ball of radius δ). After a small perturbation we may assume that the projection p of ∂D' onto y coordinate is a Morse function.

Define a 1-dimensional simplicial complex T  ⊂  D' as follows. Let a be a regular value of the projection function p|∂D' restricted to the boundary of D'. [formula] is a finite union of disjoint closed intervals {vi}. We set [formula] to be the midpoints of vi's. If a and b are two consecutive critical values of p, it follows that [formula] is a collection of disjoint simple arcs as on Figure [\ref=fig_small_length].

At a critical point ∂D' locally looks like the graph of a function f(x) =   ±  x2. We connect the endpoints of the intervals of T by a horizontal arc tangent to the critical point and contained in D'.

Note that D' retracts onto T, so in particular T must be connected and simply connected, hence a tree. We contract D along the edges of T in the obvious way. As a result we obtain a contraction of ∂D inside D to a point through curves of length ≤  (1 + ε)|∂D|. After a small perturbation we can assume that this homotopy realizes the desired diffeomorphism. For details we refer the reader to [\cite=CR], where it is shown that if there exists a homotopy of the boundary of D to a point through curves of length < L, then there exists a diffeomorphism from D to Dst so that preimages of concentric circles have length < L.

For any ε  >  0 there exists A > 0, such that for every disc D  ⊂  Mp with |D|  ≤  A there exists a T - map f from D with fibers of length less than |∂D|  +  ε.

The proof is similar to that of Lemma 2.2 in [\cite=LNR].

Choose [formula], where l is as in Lemma [\ref=small_length]. The proof is by induction on [formula]. For n  ≤  8 the result follows by Lemma [\ref=small_length]. Assume the Lemma to be true for all subdiscs with [formula] and consider the case when this quantity equals n  ≥  8.

Subdivide ∂D into 4 arcs of equal length. By Besicovitch Lemma we can find an arc α of length [formula] connecting two opposite arcs. α subdivides D into two subdiscs D1 and D2 of area ≤  A and boundary length [formula]. Hence, by inductive assumption D1 and D2 admit T - maps with fibers of length ≤  |∂D|.

By inductive assumption each disc admits a T - map with fibers of length ≤  |∂D| + ε. We also have [formula] so the result follows by Lemma [\ref=concatenation].

We need to generalize this result about small discs to other small submanifolds of Mp.

For any ε  >  0 there exists A > 0, such that for every submanifold with boundary Mk  ⊂  Mp, with |Mk|  ≤  A there exists a T - map f from Mk with fibers of length [formula].

Let Mk be a closed submanifold (with boundary) of Mp and let c be a connected component of ∂Mk. If [formula] then there exists an open ball B(d / 2)  ⊂  Mk of radius d / 2 whose interior does not intersect the boundary of Mk (and, in particular, it does not intersect the boundary of Mp). As d  →  0 the area of B(d / 2) approaches the area of a Euclidean disc of the same diameter. Since Mp is compact, this happens uniformly for all balls of radius d / 2 disjoint from the boundary. For d sufficiently small we may conclude that |Mk|  ≥  3(d / 2)2. Hence, for a sufficiently small A, if |Mk|  ≤  A then the distance [formula]. We attach k - 1 arcs {γi} to the boundary of ∂Mk of total length less than [formula] and so that [formula] is connected and its complement in Mk is homeomorphic to a disc. Denote this disc by D.

Consider the normal δ  -  neighbourhood Nδ of ∂D in Mk (see Figure [\ref=fig_small_area]) for some small δ. By Lemma [\ref=small_area_S^2] the complement of Nδ in Mk admits a T map with fibers of length [formula]. Let α be a short closed curve in Nδ which separates one connected component of ∂Mk from other connected components as on Figure [\ref=fig_small_area]. Curve α separates Nδ into two regions. Let B denote the region that contains only one connected component of ∂Mk. By Lemma [\ref=concatenation] we can extend the T - map to [formula]. By chopping off connected components of ∂Mk and applying Lemma [\ref=concatenation] repeatedly we obtain the desired T - map.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=tree1] proceeds inductively by cutting M into smaller pieces until their size is small enough so that Lemma [\ref=small_area_Mk] can be applied. We assemble T - maps on these smaller regions to obtain one map from M with the desired bound on lengths of fibers.

Fix ε > 0 and let A be as in Lemma [\ref=small_area_Mk]. Let [formula]. We claim that for every Mk  ⊂  Mp with [formula] there exists a T - map with fibers of length

[formula]

When n = N the inequality ([\ref=inductive_statement]) is true by Lemma [\ref=small_area_Mk]. We assume it to be true for n + 1  ≤  N and prove it for n.

By Proposition [\ref=subdivision] there exists γ∈S(Mk,r) of length ≤  c(r)  +  ε'.

We have two possibilities.

Case 1. γ is a simple closed curve.

In this case γ separates Mk into two regions N1 and N2 of area [formula]. The number of connected components of ∂Ni is at most k + 1.

By inductive assumption N1 and N2 admit T - maps into trees T1 and T2 respectively. We construct T by identifying the terminal vertex f1(γ) of T1 with the terminal vertex f2(γ) of T2. T - map f is defined by setting it equal to fi when restricted to Ni. A simple calculation shows that lengths of fibers of f satisfy the desired bound.

Case 2. γ is a collection of arcs with endpoints on ∂Mk.

Let {S1,...,Sj} be connected components of ∂Mk that intersect arcs of γ. For a sufficiently small δ the normal neighbourhood Nδ(Si) is foliated by closed curves of length very close to |Si|, which are transverse to the arcs of γ. In particular, each Nδ(Si) admits a T - map with fibers of length ≤  |Si| + ε'. Let A1 be the connected component of [formula] with area satisfying r|M|  ≤  |A1|  ≤  (1 - r)|M| (recall that it exists by definition of ck(r)). Let B denote [formula] and Mk' denote [formula]. (See Figure [\ref=fig_horseshoe]).

Let C be the connected component of ∂B that contains [formula]. We say that an arc α of γ is a horseshoe if α is in Mk' and the endpoints of α lie on the same connected component of ∂Mk'. We will use the following simple observation.

If γ contains no horseshoes, then there exists a connected component S of ∂Mk', such that [formula] is connected.

Let S be a connected component of ∂Mk' and suppose [formula] contains more than one interval. Let S' be an interval of [formula] and let a and b denote the endpoints of S'. [formula] consists of two arcs, call them C1 and C2. Let S1  ≠  S be a connected component of ∂Mk' that intersects C1. We claim that C2 does not intersect S1. For suppose it does, consider then a subarc C1' of C1 from a until the fist point of intersection with S1 and denote this point by a1. Similarly, denote by C2' the subarc of C2 from a until the fist point of intersection with S1 and call it a2. Let S1' be an arc of S1 from a1 to a2, then [formula] is a closed curve separating Mk' into two connected components. Moreover, the point b and points of [formula] belong to different connected components of [formula]. This is a contradiction since B is connected.

Suppose the intersection [formula] is not connected. We can then find a subarc C3  ⊂  C1 that intersects S1 only at the endpoints. The number of connected components of ∂Mk' that intersect C3 is strictly smaller than the number of components that intersect C1. Proceeding in this way we can find an arc of C that has endpoints on Sj, and its interior intersects only one connected component Sj + 1 of ∂Mk'. It follows that [formula] is connected.

We can now construct the desired T - map. By inductive assumption there exists a T - map on B with fibers [formula]. Note that [formula] and the number of connected components k' of ∂B satisfies k'  ≤  k.

Suppose first that α  ⊂  ∂B is a horseshoe. It separates Mk' into two connected components. Let B2 denote the connected component that does not contain B. Since [formula], it admits a T - map with the desired bound on length of fibiers. By Lemma [\ref=concatenation] we can extend the T - map to [formula]. Inductively we extend the T - map to a subset B'  ⊂  Mk', such that B  ⊂  B' and ∂B' does not contain any horseshoes. By Lemma [\ref=horseshoe] [formula] is connected for some i. By Lemma [\ref=concatenation] we can extend the T - map to [formula]. We iterate this procedure until we extended the T - map to a set B'', which contains Nδ(Si) for all i. The last step is to extend the T - map to the whole of Mk exactly as we did it in Case 1.

To finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=tree1] recall that [formula] as A  →  0. Since A can be chosen arbitrarily small Theorem [\ref=tree1] follows from ([\ref=inductive_statement]).

Now we can prove Theorem [\ref=1/3_area]. Let M be a Riemannian 2-sphere and f:M  →  T a T - map with fibers of length [formula]. If there are no trivalent vertices in T we can find a short closed curve that separates M into two halves of equal area.

For each trivalent vertex vk∈T let [formula]. Denote the closed curve [formula] by γkij. Assume that for every k,i,j (i  ≠  j) γkij separates M into two discs, s.t. the area of the smaller disc is strictly smaller than [formula]. Let k,i,j be such that the area of the smaller disc is maximized among all such curves.

Let Ds denote the smaller and Dl denote the larger of the subdiscs of [formula]. Let e denote the edge of T adjacent to vk, such that f- 1(e)  ⊂  Dl. We observe that the other two edges adjacent to vk are contained in f(Ds), for otherwise it would follow that the area of the smaller disc is not maximal for γkij.

We conclude that for some x∈e f- 1(x) subdivides M into two discs of area [formula] for otherwise it would again contradict our choice of γkij.

Morse function

In this section we prove the existence of a Morse function f from M to [formula] with short preimages.

Let M be a manifold with boundary. A function [formula] is called an m - function if it is Morse on the interior of M, constant on each boundary component and maps boundary components to distinct points disjoint from the critical values of f.

For [formula] and any ε > 0 there exists an m - map f from Mp, p  ≥  0, so that each fiber of the map has length less than [formula].

Theorem [\ref=morse] follows by taking [formula] and applying Theorem [\ref=papasoglu].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=morse1] proceeds along the same lines as the proof of Theorem [\ref=tree1]. There are two main differences. The fist difference is that we would like the function to be smooth (in particular, curves in the foliation f- 1(x) are not allowed to have corners) and have singularities of Morse type. This is accomplished by a simple surgery described in Lemma [\ref=theta].

The second difference is that we would like to bound the length of the whole level set, not just of the individual connected components.

We will need one technical lemma similar to concatenation Lemma [\ref=concatenation]. Let θ  ⊂  Mp denote a union of three non-intersecting simple arcs αi with common endpoints. θ subdivides Mp into three regions U12, U23, U13, choosing the indices so that [formula]. Let lij denote a curve obtained by pushing [formula] inside Uij by a small perturbation, so that it is contained in a small normal neighbourhood of θ, smooth and has length < |αi| + |αj|  +  ε. Let U(θ) denote the neighbourhood of θ bounded by curves lij (see Figure [\ref=fig_theta]).

U(θ) admits an m - map f:U(θ)  →  [0,2] with f(l23) = 0, f(l12) = 1, f(l13) = 2, and fibers satisfying the following inequalities:

For x∈[0,0.5], |f- 1(x)|  ≤  |α2| + |α3| + ε

For x∈(0.5,1], |f- 1(x)|  ≤  2|α1|  +  |α2| + |α3| + ε

For x∈(1,2], |f- 1(x)|  ≤  |α1| + |α3|  +  ε

Finally, let nij denote an outward unit normal at some point on lij, then df(n23) < 0, df(n12) > 0 and df(n13) > 0.

Let a and b denote the endpoints of αi. Since M is orientable, the normal tubular neighbourhood of [formula] is homeomorphic to the cylinder. Let lij be the boundary component of the tubular neighbourhood that does not intersect αk, (k  ≠  i,j). After a small perturbation in the neighbourhood of a and b we can assume that lij is smooth and there is a diffeomorphism fij from (0,1]  ×  S1 onto the region between [formula] and lij with [formula].

Let c be the midpoint of α1. We perform a straightforward surgery to the curves {fij(t  ×  S1)} depicted on Figure [\ref=fig_theta2]. In the neighbourhood of c we can choose a coordinate chart so that curves in the new foliation are given by f(x,y) = 0.5  -  x2  +  y2.

Now we prove the analogue of Lemmas [\ref=small_area_S^2] and [\ref=small_area_Mk] for m - functions.

For any ε  >  0 there exists A > 0, such that for every disc D  ⊂  M with |D|  ≤  A there exists an m - map f from D with fibers of length less than |∂D|  +  ε.

As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=small_area_S^2], we proceed by induction on [formula]. However, the inductive assumption is now different. We would like to show that for every ε > 0 a subdisc D  ⊂  M admits an m - map with fibers of length

[formula]

Assume the Lemma to be true for all subdiscs with [formula].

We take small tubular neigbourhood of ∂D in D and foliate it by closed curves of length ≤  |∂D|  +  ε'. We subdivide the innermost curve γ into 4 arcs of equal length. By Besicovitch Lemma we can find an arc α of length [formula] connecting two opposite subarcs of γ.

Let N be the neighbourhood of [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=theta]. Note that ∂N has 3 connected components: one of them is ∂D and denote the other two by C1 and C2, bounding subdiscs D1 and D2 respectively. Assume that D1 is a disc of smaller area, hence [formula].

N admits an m - map f0:N  →  [0,2] with fibers of length [formula] for x∈[0,1] and |f- 1(x)|  ≤  |∂D2| + ε' for x∈(1,2].

Since [formula] by inductive assumption D1 admits an m - map f1 with fibers of length [formula]. After appropriately scaling f1 on a small neigbourhood of C1 and multiplying by - 1 if necessary we can assume that f1(C) is the minimum point of f1. Furthermore, we scale and shift f1 so that f1(C1) = 1 and f1(D1) is contained between 1 and 1.5 We now extend the m - map to [formula] with fibers of length

[formula]

[formula]

By inductive assumption D2 admits an m - function f2 with fibers of length [formula]. We modify f2 so that it takes on its minimum at f2(C2) = 2. We can now extend f to the whole of D.

Setting A < ε2 / 100 and ε'  <  ε / 10 we obtain the desired result.

For any ε  >  0 there exists A > 0, such that for every submanifold with boundary Mk  ⊂  Mp, with |Mk|  ≤  A there exists an m - map f from Mk with fibers of length [formula].

As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=small_area_Mk] we connect all components of ∂Mk with (k - 1) closed curves γi of total length [formula] and denote the union of γis and ∂Mk by C. Denote the normal δ  -  neighbourhood of C in Mk by N. After a small perturbation we can assume that the boundary of N is smooth.

The complement D of N in Mk is a disc and so by Lemma [\ref=m-small_area_disc] it admits an m - map with fibers of length [formula]. Next we proceed as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=small_area_Mk] extending the domain of the m - function over connected components of ∂Mk one by one.

Let {βi}ki = 1 be a collection of nested simple closed curves in N and Ni denote the subset of N between βi and βi + 1. We require that [formula], β1  =  ∂D and for each i Ni contains exactly one connected component of ∂Mk. We can then apply Lemma [\ref=theta] to extend the m - function from D to N1 and inductively to the whole of Mk.

By appropriately scaling and shifting functions obtained at each step we ensure that the desired bound on the lengths of fibers is maintained.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=morse1]. The proof is similar to that of Theorem [\ref=tree1]. Again we proceed by induction on [formula].

Fix ε > 0 and let A be as in Lemma [\ref=m-small_area_Mk]. Let [formula]. We claim that for every Mk  ⊂  Mp with [formula] there exists an m - map with fibers of length

[formula]

Choose γ∈S(Mk,r) of length ≤  c(r)  +  ε'.

Case 1. γ is a simple closed curve.

Let N1 and N2 denote the two components of [formula]. In this case there is an m - function f1 from N1 onto

[formula]

. Hence, we obtain an m - function f:Mp  →  [a,c] satisfying the same bound on the length of the fibers. Using the inductive assumption we calculate that this length bound is exactly what we want.

Case 2. γ is a collection of arcs with endpoints on the boundary of ∂Mp.

As in the proof Theorem [\ref=tree1] we add a small collar around boundary components of Mp that intersect γ. We apply the inductive assumption to B  ⊂  Mp and extend this map to regions separated from B by "horseshoes". Then we extend the map to collars whose intersection with ∂B is a connected arc. We iterate this procedure until we extended the map to all of Mp. By appropriately scaling the m - functions obtained for each region we ensure the correct bound on the lengths of fibers.
