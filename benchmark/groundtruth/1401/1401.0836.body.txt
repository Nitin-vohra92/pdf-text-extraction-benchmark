Introduction

In this note we consider graphs which are finite, undirected, and have no loops or multiple edges. Let V(G) and E(G) denote the sets of vertices and edges of a graph G, respectively. The degree of a vertex v∈V(G) is denoted by dG(v) and the chromatic index of G by [formula]. For a graph G, let Δ(G) and δ(G) denote the maximum and minimum degrees of vertices in G, respectively. An (a,b)-biregular bipartite graph G is a bipartite graph G with the vertices in one part all having degree a and the vertices in the other part all having degree b. The terms and concepts that we do not define can be found in [\cite=West].

A proper edge-coloring of a graph G is a mapping [formula] such that [formula] for every pair of adjacent edges [formula]. If α is a proper edge-coloring of a graph G, then [formula] denotes the sum of the colors of the edges of G. For a graph G, define the edge-chromatic sum [formula] as follows: [formula], where minimum is taken among all possible proper edge-colorings of G. A proper t-coloring is a proper edge-coloring which makes use of t different colors. If α is a proper t-coloring of G and v∈V(G), then [formula] denotes set of colors appearing on edges incident to v. Let G be a graph and R  ⊆  V(G). A proper edge-coloring of a graph G with colors [formula] is called an R-sequential t-coloring if the edges incident to each vertex v∈R are colored by the colors [formula].

The concept of sequential edge-coloring of graphs was introduced by Asratian [\cite=Asr]. In [\cite=Asr] [\cite=AsrKam1], he proved the following result.

Theorem 1. If [formula] is a bipartite graph with dG(x)  ≥  dG(y) for every xy∈E(G), where x∈X and y∈Y, then G has an X-sequential Δ(G)-coloring.

On the other hand, in [\cite=AsrKam1] Asratian and Kamalian showed that the problem of deciding whether a bipartite graph [formula] with Δ(G) = 3 has an X-sequential 3-coloring is NP-complete. Some other results on sequential edge-colorings of graphs were obtained in [\cite=Kam] [\cite=KamSweden]. In particular, in [\cite=KamSweden] Kamalian proved the following result.

Theorem 2. If G is an (r - 1,r)-biregular (r  ≥  3) bipartite graph with n vertices, then G has an R-sequential r-coloring with [formula].

In this note we generalize last theorem. As a corollary, we also obtain the following result: if G is a graph with Δ(G) - δ(G)  ≤  1 and [formula] (r  ≥  3), then [formula].

The Result

Theorem 3. If G a graph with Δ(G) - δ(G)  ≤  1 and [formula] (r  ≥  3), then G has an R-sequential r-coloring with [formula], where n = |V(G)| and nr  =  |{v∈V(G):dG(v) = r}|.

Proof. Since [formula], there exists a proper r-coloring α of the graph G with colors [formula]. For [formula], define the set Vα(i) as follows:

[formula].

Clearly, for any [formula], we have

[formula]   and   [formula],

where Vr  =  {v∈V(G):dG(v) = r}.

Hence,

[formula].

This implies that there exists i0, 1  ≤  i0  ≤  r, for which [formula]. Let [formula]. Clearly, [formula].

If i0 = r, then α is an R-sequential r-coloring of G; otherwise define an edge-coloring β as follows: for any e∈E(G), let

[formula]α(e),&ifα(e)≠ i,r[formula]i,&ifα(e)=r[formula]r,&ifα(e)=i[formula]

It is easy to see that β is an R-sequential r-coloring of G with [formula]. [formula]

Corollary 1. If G is an (r - 1,r)-biregular (r  ≥  3) bipartite graph with n vertices, then G has an R-sequential r-coloring with [formula].

Corollary 2. If G is a graph with Δ(G) - δ(G)  ≤  1 and [formula] (r  ≥  3), then

[formula]

Proof. Let α be an R-sequential r-coloring of G with [formula] described in the proof of Theorem 3. Now, we have
