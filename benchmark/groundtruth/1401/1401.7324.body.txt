Introduction

Silicon detectors have been widely used in nuclear physics and high energy physics during the past decades thanks to the improvement of modern semiconductor technology [\cite=knoll] [\cite=lutz] [\cite=leda] [\cite=walton]. With their good energy resolution, fast time response and reliable stability, silicon detectors have been applied to energy spectrum measurement, time signal pickup, and particle identification as well as tracking systems, such as the use in the complete-kinematics measurement of two-proton emission from extremely proton-rich nuclei [\cite=lin2009] [\cite=xu2010] [\cite=xuplb], Silicon Ball for the research on the weakly bound nuclei close to particle drip line [\cite=siball], and MUST/MUST2 [\cite=must] [\cite=must2] for radioactive beam experiments. Among them, Passivated Implanted Planar Silicon (PIPS) detectors fabricated in the "Planar" process [\cite=kemmer80] [\cite=kemmer84] have enjoyed widespread adoption.

PIPS detectors, in most applications, have some advantages over traditional Silicon Surface Barrier (SSB) detectors [\cite=knoll] [\cite=lutz]. All the junction edges of the PIPS detectors are buried in the process of oxide passivation, which can achieve better stability and lower reverse leakage current, while the SSB detectors have crude junction edges. In addition, junctions formed by well controlled ion-implantation provide thin entrance windows and can also reduce the leakage current. Low leakage current makes noise reduction. Moreover, thin entrance window means thin dead layer, which brings not only improvement of energy resolution but also reduction of energy straggling. Therefore, it enables the possibility of closer detector-source distance to achieve compact geometry and high efficiency [\cite=bergmann].

Despite of the excellence of their response, however, PIPS detectors have shortcomings as well, especially for ones of large area. Large capacitor resulted from large area will in turn lead to slow rise time and small voltage output with equal quantity of charge ionized. Besides, detector capacitor is also one of the non-negligible noise causing factors. In the applications that demand time signal pick-up and high signal-to-noise ratio, one can use a quadrant PIPS to replace large-area one in view of that the area is reduced to a quarter. Quadrant silicon detectors (QSDs) also have other advantages, for instance, a certain position resolution and the reduction of the count rate of readout electronics. There are already commercially available quadrant silicon detectors [\cite=micron] and they have been used in ISOLDE Silicon Ball [\cite=siball].

The QSD has been successfully developed at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The manufacturing procedure, test procedure, and electronics as well as detection performance are presented in detail. Afterwards, the complicated correlations between two neighbouring quads, as a result of charge sharing effects, are discussed.

Manufacturing procedure

From the manufacturing point of view, the planar process was developed for producing Integrated Circuits (IC), and it has also been applied to the fabrication semiconductor detectors nowadays [\cite=knoll] [\cite=kemmer84]. The process is complicated, that combines many crucial techniques such as oxide passivation, photolithography and ion implantation. The whole production flow of our PIPS-QSD goes as follows:

Polish and clean. The fabrication of detectors start from a 4 inches, 300 μm thick, high-resistivity (greater than 10 kΩ  ·  cm), high-purity, n-type silicon wafer. The wafer should be polished and cleaned at the beginning.

Oxide passivation. The polished Si wafers are passivated by thermal oxidation at temperature up to 1030[formula]C. O2 gas stream flow past the Si wafers and then about 600 nm thick oxide layer (SiO2) come into being on the wafer surface.

Photolithography. Four entrance windows, corresponding to the four quadrants of the finished detector, should be opened. Each one has the area of 24×  24 mm2. The oxide layers on those areas are removed with the photolithographic equipment and proper etching techniques.

Ion implantation. The junction side is formed by boron ions implantation within the window, while the ohmic side is implanted with phosphorus ions. Therefore, a thin layer of pure silicon on surface are doped into p-type on junction side and n-type on ohmic side, respectively. Proper energy and dose of boron ions are typically 15 keV and 5×  1014 ions/cm2.

Annealing. Thermal annealing is one of the most effective methods to remove the radiation damage in the implanted layers in the premise of guarantee low leakage current of detectors. The implanted Si wafers should be annealed in dry N2 gas at 600[formula]C.

Al metallization. Both the front and rear surfaces should be evaporated by aluminum for ohmic electrical contacts. The aluminum layer should be very thin, for the energy straggling of incoming particles in aluminum layer contributes to the noise.

Al patterning at the front. The aluminum on the oxide layers should be removed using photolithographic technique.

Alloy. The aluminum electrode should be alloyed at 380[formula]C.

Encapsulation. The last step is separating each individual detectors and then encapsulating. The detector chip is mounted on the print circuit board (PCB) and the golden wires connect the aluminum electrodes with readout contacts on PCBs using ultrasonic soldering.

The profile view of the QSD is depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig1]. Active area of the detector is 48×  48 mm2, which is divided into four quads (24×  24 mm2) by the SiO2 bar of 0.1 mm wide.

Electronics performance

Electronic setup

The test was performed with 241Am and 239Pu α sources. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig2], the detector and the preamplifiers were put in a vacuum chamber. α-particles from radioactive source irradiated the QSD, then the produced charges were collected by the charge sensitive preamplifiers. With the aim of multi-channel integration, low noise and high signal-to-noise ratio, the preamplifiers were well designed on a PCB to direct connection with detectors. Performance of the preamplifier is excellent, with bandwidth around 245 MHz and noise better than 5 nV/[formula]. Negative bias voltage was applied to the junction side through 100 MΩ resistor built in the AC-coupled preamplifier while the ohmic side was directly earthed. The injected charges were integrated on the feedback capacitor into a current pulse, which was then shaped by a spectroscopy amplifier CAEN N1568A. Timing signals were produced by the build-in constant fraction discriminator (CFD) of the amplifier, as a trigger to generate the gate signal for V785 ADC. Based on the VME data acquisition system, V785 ADC converted the height of pulse into a digital signal to save on a PC for further data analysing. The sequence of the number of four quads is also shown in Fig. [\ref=fig2]. Hereinafter, we call Quad.1 as Q1 for convenience, and the same for the other ones.

Leakage current

The bias voltage applied to the detector is supplied by a Keithley 2602A Source Meter, total leakage currents of four quads can be measured simultaneously. Fig. [\ref=fig3] presents the curve of leakage currents of the QSD as a function of the bias voltage. The test was performed at room temperature 25 [formula]C. When the detector is fully depleted at the bias voltage -16 V, the leakage current of each quad is as low as 2.53 nA. Even under the bias of -20 V, the leakage of each quad is merely 5.01 nA. During the whole test procedure, the leakage currents are roughly constant, showing a good stability.

Leakage current is a significant factor that should be considered for operating almost all the semiconductor junction detectors. For one thing, great magnitude of leakage currents could bury weak signals to be measured. For another, fluctuations of the leakage currents contribute to the electronic noise, which broaden the overall peak and consequently reduce the energy resolution. It is known that leakage currents originate from the surface and bulk volume of the detector. The bulk leakage results from the diffusion of the minority carriers and the thermal generation of electron-hole pairs, both of which show little connection with the manufacturing process. Different from this, surface leakage currents, related to the large voltage gradient at the junction edges, are dependent on the encapsulation of detector and the contamination on the detector surface. From this point of view, the low level of the leakage currents of these QSDs represents the fabricating process technic level of the detector to some extent.

Energy and timing responses

The output energy signals of preamplifiers generated by α-particles illuminating onto the detector are injected into an oscilloscope, thus the pulse amplitude and rise time measurements are accessible. The upper panel in Fig. [\ref=fig4] shows the pulse amplitude and rise time as a function of reverse bias voltage when α particles irradiating on the junction side of the detector. The bias increases with a step of 2 V from 0 V to -30 V. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig4], the pulse goes high and rises fast while the bias goes up from 0 V to -10 V. Once the bias is increased over -12 V, the pulse height is roughly constant and remains 89 mV while the rise time decreases slowly and levels off at higher voltage.

As the range of 5 MeV α particles in silicon is about 30 μm, just a tenth of the whole thickness of Si bulk, it may not be persuasive to determine the full depletion of p-n junction simply according to the signals from incidence on junction side. The lower panel in Fig. [\ref=fig4] presents the same curves but α particles irradiating on the ohmic side. In this case, under the bias less than -10 V, the raising time of that signal is rather slow and the pulse height is slightly small in contrast with the situation of illumination on junction side. Obviously, it is resulted from the weak electric field near the ohmic side. The pulse height gets to be saturated and the rise time grows slowly until the bias increases to -16 V, under which bias voltage, we can conclude, the p-n junction is fully depleted. Considering that the detector should be over-depleted, we applied the bias voltage of -20 V across the detector during the test. Under this bias, the raising time of signal of 241Am α particles is 158 ns.

Detection performance

Energy resolution

Figure [\ref=fig5] presents a typical α particle energy spectrum of 239Pu source. The two peaks are corresponding to 5.157 MeV and 5.499 MeV [\cite=rytz], respectively. The peak of 5.499 MeV is caused by the mixed 238Pu, and the peak of 5.157 MeV contains the contributions from 5.144 MeV and 5.106 MeV α particles of small branch ratio but being unable to be distinguished. After single-peak Gaussian fit of the 5.157 MeV peak, one can calculate that the σ = 10.484 Ch and the peak is located at 2545.8 Ch, resulting in the energy resolution of 0.97%. That is to say the energy resolving capability is about 50 keV. The energy resolution was relatively consistent across the four quads with a difference less than 5% off the average. Considering that the α source is too close (about 8 cm) to the detector that the incident angle tends to vary largely so as to increase the energy straggling, the energy resolution may improve under the condition of the vertical incidence after collimation. The performance of energy resolution is acceptable.

It is the good energy resolution that is the most dramatic factor of silicon detector. And it ensures the wide applications of these detectors on energy spectrum measurements and particle discrimination. Energy resolution depends on many physical factors, not only the detector itself, but also the front-end electronics system and even the energy and mass of the charged particle to be detected. If the impacts of system energy resolution are excluded, the intrinsic energy resolution of the detector should be better than 50 keV.

Charge collection analysis

Figure [\ref=fig6] shows typical correlation spectrum of 241Am α particles between two neighbouring quads on the same QSD, the upper panel for α particles irradiating on the junction side and the lower panel for the ohmic side. Charge sharing effect [\cite=poehlsen] [\cite=yorkston] [\cite=grassi] can be observed from both of them. For convenience of expression, the spectrum are divided into seven zones.

In the upper panel, the vast majority of events (in Zone 1, almost 98.9% of all effective events) shows the two quads records α particles independently in addition to few accidental coincidence events (in Zone 2, about 0.4%). There are also a tiny number of events (in Zone 3, 4, 5, and 6, about 0.6%) show complicated correlations between the two quads. The active area of the detector is 48×  48 mm2, and the width of the isolation bar is 0.1 mm, then one can get the ratio of dead zone to the active zone is (0.1 + 0.1)  ÷  48 = 0.42%. From its consistence with the ratio of the number of correlation events to that of total events, one can surmise that the correlation may be caused by events that α particles incident on the inter-quad area.

It encourages us to do further test to search out the origination of these correlation events. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig7], different part of the detector was masked by a thick paper board with a window at different position to let α particles merely irradiate on specific area, events from which can be distinguished therefore.

In Fig. [\ref=fig7](a), only part of one quad was irradiated. This test shows that there is no correlation observed between any two quads. The spectrums of three non-irradiated quads were blank except noises in extremely low channels. It is concluded that the front-to-end electronic crosstalk can be neglected and the effects of capacity coupling were not observed.

As for Fig. [\ref=fig7](b), part of the inter-quad region between two quads was irradiated, and events originated from this region can be studied. Four panels in Fig. [\ref=fig8] present the scatter plots of different pairs of the four quads. In Fig. [\ref=fig8](a), symmetrical broken-line of spectrum of Q1 vs Q2 is presented. Obviously, charges ionized by α particles that irradiated on the inter-quad region are not collected completely by Q1 and Q2, otherwise the spectrum of the two quads should be a straight line EQ1 + EQ2 = Etot. Furthermore, the closer to each other the values of Q1 and Q2 become, the greater quantity of charges they lose. The lost charges are collected by Q3 and Q4, as will be further discussed below. That is certainly corresponding to the events in Zone 3 of Fig. [\ref=fig6].

From the plot of Q1 vs Q4 in Fig. [\ref=fig8](b), one can find out that Q4 gets to its maximum at the turning point of the broken line of Q1 vs Q2, meaning that Q4 collects a maximum amount of charge when Q1 and Q2 losing the most. It can be concluded that charges are shared by four quads even α particles just incident on the inter-quad region between two quads. It is similar to the events in Zone 4 and Zone 5 of Fig. [\ref=fig6]. Zone 4 is composed of events that α particles irradiated on the inter-quad area between Q1 and Q4, and the charges are partly collected by Q2. Likewise, events in Zone 5 stand for α particles irradiating between Q2 and Q3, and part of the charges are collected by Q1.

The plot of Q3 vs Q4 is given out in Fig. [\ref=fig8](c). What puzzled a lot is that Q3 always collected the same quantity of charges with Q4. It may be understood like that the charges ionized at the inter-quad region between Q1 and Q2 may not only be collected by Q1 and Q2, but also drift along the long inter-quad insolation strip and finally be bisected by Q3 and Q4. Homologous events in Fig. [\ref=fig6] are located in Zone 6, that charges are ionized between Q3 and Q4, and part of them drifting along the SiO2 isolation strip are equally shared by Q1 and Q2 finally.

In order to further verify this, we give out the spectrum of Q1+Q4 vs Q2+Q3 in Fig. [\ref=fig8](d), the correlation between these two parameters are closer to the straight line. According to this fact, it can be concluded that most of the charges are shared by the quads on the both sides of the isolation strip, and only a small part of charge were lost during the collection.

Unlike the case in upper panel of Fig. [\ref=fig6], events of α particles irradiating on the ohmic side do not have complex correlations. The straight line in Zone 7 represents events that charges are completely collected by two neighbouring quads, but not shared by four quads.

Conclusions can be made based on different phenomenons of irradiation on two sides of the detector, that the electric field distortion occurs in the inter-quad regions, and only near the surface of junction side. α particles irradiate on the inter-quad region between two quads on junction side and the ionized charges are affected by the distorted electric field and partly collected by the other two quads. While irradiation take place on the ohmic side, α particles cannot feel the electric field distortion before being stopped, and the ionized charges were completely collected.

Generally speaking, the amount of the inter-quad events are small enough to be neglected in practical use of the experiments.

Summary

The QSDs for charged particle detection were developed at China Institute of Atomic Energy. The thickness of the QSD is about 300 μm and the active area is 48×  48 mm2 with 0.1 mm wide isolation bar between each two quads. Tests with 241Am and 239Pu radioactive sources were carried out to assess the performance of the detector. The leakage current under the over-depletion bias voltage of -20 V is as small as 5.01 nA, and the raising time is better than 160 ns. The energy resolution for 5.157 MeV α-particle is about 1%. The analysis results show the existence of complicated correlations between neighboring quads, which was caused by the electric field distortion near the isolation bar. The inter-quad events would not impact too much as the amount of these events is tiny. These performances are acceptable. In view of the fabrication reaching such a level that these detectors can be used in nuclear physics experiments, one should also consider the long term behaviour of these detectors, such as radiation damage and electrical stability.
