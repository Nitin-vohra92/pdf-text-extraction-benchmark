Local a Priori Estimate on the General Scale Subdomains

Introduction

Recently, parallel techniques for the finite element computation have become very attractive. These exists a type of parallel schemes which are based on the understanding of the local and global properties of a finite element solution for the elliptic type problems which is proposed in [\cite=XuZhLP2G] and then has been studied extensively [\cite=LiHanXieYouLPMEigen] [\cite=LinXieMultilevelEigen] [\cite=XuZhLP2GNL] [\cite=XuZhLP2GEigen]. The cornerstone of this technique is the local a priori estimate [\cite=Wahlbin] [\cite=XuZhLP2G], where the involved constant is independent of the mesh parameters. However, the dependence of the constant on the scale of the subdomains is not so clear. If we want to consider the sharp effects caused by local subdomain (Ω0), it is necessary to clarify the dependence of the coefficient on the diameter of Ω0 (denoted by dΩ0). For example, in [\cite=LiHanXieYouLPMEigen] [\cite=XuZhLP2GNL] [\cite=XuZhLP2GEigen], we need to know how large of the subdomain to construct the efficient parallel method. In this paper, we explicitly show the dependence of the local priori error estimate on the subdomain scale dΩ0.

The rest of this paper is organized as follow. In the next section, some notation, assumptions and basic results are listed. In Section 3, a local estimate of the finite element solution is derived on the general scale domain and the dependence of the local estimates on the subdomain scale is clarified. Some concluding remarks are given in the last section.

Preliminaries

In this section, following [\cite=XuZhLP2G], we firstly state the model problem and list some basic notations and results. Then we set some reasonable assumptions on the finite element spaces and show their reasonability.

Model problem

Let Ω be a bounded domain in Rd [formula]. We shall use standard notation for Sobolev spaces Ws,p(Ω) and their associated norms and seminorms [\cite=Adams]. For p = 2, we denote Hs(Ω) = Ws,2(Ω) and H10(Ω) = {v∈H1(Ω): v|∂Ω = 0}, where v|∂Ω = 0 is in the sense of trace, and [formula]. In some places, [formula] should be viewed as piecewise defined if it is necessary. For D  ⊂  G  ⊂  Ω, the notation D  ⊂    ⊂  G to means that [formula]. Note that any w∈H10(Ω0) can be naturally extended to be a function in H10(Ω) with zero outside of Ω0. Thus we will state this fact by the abused notation H10(Ω0)  ⊂  H10(Ω).

In this paper, we mainly consider the following second order elliptic problem:

[formula]

Here L is a general linear second order elliptic operator: with aij, bi∈W1,  ∞(Ω), 0  ≤  φ∈L∞(Ω) and the matrix (aij)1  ≤  i,j  ≤  d being uniformly positive definite on Ω.

The weak form of ([\ref=Model_Problem]) is as follows:

Find [formula] such that

[formula]

where (  ·  ,  ·  ) is the standard inner-product of L2(Ω) and with

[formula]

In this paper, we assume there exists constants C independent of Ω such that the follow inequalities hold

[formula]

and

[formula]

In order to define higher derivatives of functions with multi variables, we introduce the following multi-index [formula] and the corresponding differential operator:

[formula]

Furthermore, we say α  ≤  β if and only if αi  ≤  βi, [formula]. And when α  ≥  β, we denote [formula]. For derivative of the product of two functions, we have

[formula]

where [formula].

Some assumptions on the finite element spaces

Following [\cite=XuZhLP2G], we present some assumptions on the finite element spaces and then define the corresponding finite element approximation for the problem ([\ref=Weak_Form_Global]).

First we generate a shape-regular decomposition Th(Ω) for the computing domain Ω  ⊂  Rd (d = 2,3) into triangles or rectangles for d = 2 (tetrahedrons or hexahedrons for d = 3). The diameter of a cell K∈Th(Ω) is denoted by hK. The mesh size function is denoted by h(x) whose value is the diameter hK of the element K including x.

Now, we state the following assumption for the mesh considered in this paper: A.0. There exists γ > 1 such that

[formula]

where hΩ  =   max x∈Ωh(x) is the largest mesh size of Th(Ω) and C is a constant independent of Ω and h(x).

Based on the triangulation Th(Ω), we define the finite element space Sh(Ω)  ⊂  H1(Ω) and [formula]. Given G  ⊂  Ω, we use Sh(G) and Th(G) to denote the restriction of Sh(Ω) and Th(Ω) to G, respectively, and define

[formula]

For any concerned subdomain G  ⊂  Ω in this paper, we assume that it aligns with the partition Th(Ω).

Now, we would like to state some assumptions on the finite element space. The constants C appeared here and after are independent of the scale of Ω and mesh parameters. A.1. (Approximation). For any w∈H10(Ω), we have

[formula]

as hΩ  →  0. A.1'. (Approximation). There exists r  ≥  1 such that for any w∈H10(Ω),

[formula]

A.2. (Inverse Estimate). For any v∈Sh(Ω0),

[formula]

A.3. (Superapproximation). For G  ⊂  Ω0, let ω∈C∞0(Ω) with supp ω  ⊂    ⊂  G. Then for any w∈Sh(G), there is v∈S0h(G) such that

[formula]

To show the reasonability of the above assumptions, we state the normal Lagrange finite element spaces which satisfies the above assumptions, i.e.,

[formula]

where Pr(K) denote the space of polynomials of degree not greater than the positive integer r.

Now, we can to investigate the new versions of Assumptions A.1, A.1', A.2 and A.3 on the general subdomain scales. For this aim, we need to introduce the affine mapping which transforms the general domain Ω0 to the reference domain 0 with size 1. The affine mapping can be defined as follows:

[formula]

where x0 is any inner point of Ω0. Through this map, K and Th(Ω0) are transformed to [formula] and h(0), respectively. It is obvious that

[formula]

We define û(ξ)  =  u(x) with [formula] for u(x) with x∈Ω0. Then it is naturally that   =  û. Similarly to ([\ref=Multi_Diff]), we also define

[formula]

It is easy to derive that αû(ξ)  =  d|α|Ω0Dαu(x) and Dαu(x)  =  d- |α|Ω0αû(ξ). Then we can define the corresponding Ŝh(0) which can be viewed as the transformation of Sh(Ω0) through the map ([\ref=transform]).

If we take Sh(Ω) as in ([\ref=Lagrange_r]), then assumptions A.1, A.1' and A.2 hold. Assumption A.3 should be changed to the following version:

A.3. (Superapproximation).  For G  ⊂  Ω0, let ω∈C∞0(Ω) with supp ω  ⊂    ⊂  G. Then for any w∈Sh(G), there is v∈S0h(G) such that

[formula]

First, it is obvious that the space Sh(Ω) satisfies Assumptions A.1, A.1', A.2 (c.f. [\cite=Ciarlet]). Here we mainly concern the proof of Assumption A.3. From ω∈C∞0(Ω0), [formula], Assumption A.1' and polynomial interpolation theory in [\cite=Ciarlet], there exist ∈S0h(0) such that

[formula]

where C is a constant independent of 0. Frome Leibnitz formula ([\ref=r_diff_product]) and [formula] on any element ∈h(0), the following inequalities hold

[formula]

We take v(x)  =  (ξ) with [formula] and claim that v is the desired function in Assumption A.3. In fact, by changing variables and combing ([\ref=Interpolation_Hat]) and ([\ref=r_Diff_Hat]), we have

[formula]

Together with the inverse inequality, ([\ref=break_11_seminorm]) can be reduced to

[formula]

From Poincaré inequality, we have

[formula]

Then combining ([\ref=super_1_seminorm]) and ([\ref=super_0_norm]), we obtain the desired result ([\ref=Superapproximation_New]) and the proof is complete.

Local a priori estimate

In this section, we derive a new local a priori estimate which is dependent on the subdomain scale and is different from the one in [\cite=XuZhLP2G] where the local a priori estimate are provided for the case with the subdomain scale being O(1). The local estimate here is for the general subdomain scales.

The following lemma is the same as [\cite=XuZhLP2G]. But here we need to prove it for the general scale subdomains Ω0.

Let D  ⊂    ⊂  Ω0, and let ω∈C∞0(Ω) be such that supp ω  ⊂    ⊂  Ω0. Then

[formula]

With integration by parts, we have the following identity

[formula]

Let us define

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then we can rewrite the identity ([\ref=Identity]) as follows With the transform operator F defined in ([\ref=transform]) and following the bilinear form ([\ref=Bilinear_Form]), we define

[formula]

Thus Similarly, we define

[formula]

Then the following identity holds: By changing variable, we have

[formula]

where C is a constant independent of the scale of Ω0. Then the rest of the proof is the same as the proof of [\cite=XuZhLP2G].

Now, we come give the local a priori estimate for the general scale domains.

Suppose that f∈H- 1(Ω) and D  ⊂    ⊂  Ω0. If Assumptions A.0, A.1, A.2 and the new A.3 in Proposition [\ref=New_A3] hold and w∈Sh(Ω0) satisfies

[formula]

then the following local estimate holds

[formula]

where C is a constant independent of D and the mesh size, p is the number of mesh layer from D to Ω0, ε is defined by

[formula]

and [formula] is defined as follows

Let p be an integer such that there exist Ωj [formula] satisfying Choose D1  ⊂  Ω satisfying D  ⊂    ⊂  D1  ⊂    ⊂  Ωp and ω∈C∞0(Ω) such that [formula] on 1 and supp ω  ⊂    ⊂  Ωp. Then From ([\ref=positive_definite_A]), ([\ref=Bounded_Operator]), ([\ref=Weak_Form_Local]), ([\ref=Technique]) and Assumption A.3, we have

[formula]

With an application of kick-back argument to ([\ref=to_kick_back]), we have Thus, the following estimate holds Note that D can be viewed as Ωp + 1, the above process can be taken recursively and leads to Combining the above inequalities and the inverse inequality, we have

[formula]

This is the desired result and the proof is complete.

From the delicate local a priori estimate ([\ref=Local_Estimate]), we can find that the usual local estimate

[formula]

holds only on the case where the scale of Ω0 is O(1). It means that the number of subdomains should be O(1) and the speed up rate of the parallel technique based on local a priori estimate also should be O(1).

Concluding remarks

In this note, we investigate the dependence of the local a priori estimates on the scale of the subdomains. As we know, some domain decomposition and parallel techniques depend on the local a priori estimate of the finite element method. From the derived local estimate ([\ref=Local_Estimate]), we can find that the local estimate depends on the scale of the subdomains. This dependence push a constraint to the speed up rate of the parallel technique based on the local error estimate. This is why we consider this problem here and the derived results may give some hints for constructing the domain decomposition techniques to solve partial differential equations.
