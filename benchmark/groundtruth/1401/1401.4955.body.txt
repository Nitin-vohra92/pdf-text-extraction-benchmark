Introduction

Frames of translates, i.e. frames originated by the shifts of a given, fixed function, are an important mathematical background for Gabor [\cite=ole1], wavelet [\cite=Bentreib01] and sampling theory [\cite=aldrgroech1]. One generating function φ is shifted to create the analyzing family of elements, [formula] for a sequence [formula] These type of frames play a main role in the theory of shift invariant spaces (SIS) [\cite=bo00] [\cite=dedero94] [\cite=dedero94b], which is very useful for the modeling of problems in signal processing, and is central in approximation, sampling and wavelet theory.

Frames of translates are closely related to frames of exponentials also called Fourier frames [\cite=duffschaef1] [\cite=Seip1] [\cite=OS02].

The regular shifts, e.g. when λk  =  kb for some b > 0, were studied e.g. in [\cite=Cachka01]. Investigations of irregular frames of translates, where the set Λ has no regular structure, were done e.g. in [\cite=ole1] [\cite=aldrgroech1]. But there are several results that have not been generalized, in particular the concept of Gramian function, which is a fundamental tool for describing properties of systems of translates. Also no explicit formulas for the canonical dual of irregular frames of translates were given so far. We do this in the present paper.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:notprel0] we summarize basic notations and preliminaries. In Section [\ref=mainres0] we present the main results. In Section [\ref=sec:gramirreg0] we generalize the concept of the Gramian function and use it to describe Bessel and Riesz properties of irregular shifts. In Section [\ref=sec:operbaseirreg0] we look at the interrelation of the frame-related operators for those sequences to those of exponential functions. This permits us to study Bessel, frame and Riesz properties of irregular frames of translates, and furthermore give formulas for the canonical dual, and for equivalent Parseval frames.

Notation and Preliminaries

Given [formula] we denote by eλ the function defined by eλ(x) = e- 2πiλx. The operators Tλ and Mλ are given by Tλf(x) = f(x - λ) and Mλf(x) = e-  λf(x) respectively. We write [formula] for the Fourier transform, [formula], given by [formula] for [formula] with the natural extension to [formula]

In this paper [formula] is a bounded set. We denote

[formula]

The space is a closed subspace of [formula] which is isomorphic to L2(E), and we will identify these two spaces. The Fourier transform maps PWE onto L2(E).

When we write that [formula] is a frame (frame sequence, Bessel sequence, or Riesz basis) of L2(E) we will mean that the set [formula] has that property, where χE stands for the indicator function of E, i.e. it is an outer frame, Bessel or Riesz basis [\cite=alcamo04]. For a given operator O we denote its pseudo-inverse by [formula]. Motivated by that, for a function ψ we denote

[formula]

Throughout this work [formula] will be a sequence in [formula] For a function f we denote its range by Rf.

Frames

Let H be a separable Hilbert space. A sequence [formula] is a frame for H if there exist positive constants A and B that satisfy

[formula]

We denote the optimal bounds by A(opt) and B(opt). If A = B then it is called a tight frame and if A = B = 1 a Parseval frame. If [formula] satisfies the right inequality in the above formula, it is called a Bessel sequence.

A sequence [formula] is a Riesz basis for H if it is complete in H and there exist 0 < A  ≤  B such that for every finite scalar sequence [formula] The constants A and B are called Riesz bounds.

We say that [formula] is a frame sequence (Riesz sequence) if it is a frame (Riesz basis) for its span.

For [formula] a Bessel sequence, its analysis operator [formula] is defined by [formula], and its synthesis operator [formula] by [formula].

If Ψ is a frame of H, the frame operator S:H  →  H given by [formula] is bounded, invertible, self-adjoint and positive. There always exists a dual frame of Ψ, which is a frame [formula] such that

[formula]

The sequence [formula] satisfies ([\ref=dualeq]). It is called the canonical dual frame of [formula] and we will denote it by [formula]. We distinguish between the operators by subscripts, e.g. Ce is the analysis operator for the set of exponentials [formula] and Cφ those of the system of translates [formula]. For the operators connected to the canonical dual we will write e respectively φ.

To every frame [formula] a canonical tight frame can be associated, which is the sequence [formula] where [formula] is the positive square root of S- 1.

The (bi-infinite) Gram matrix G for Ψ is given by [formula] for [formula] This matrix defines an operator by the standard matrix multiplication on [formula], the set of square summable sequences. It is known, see e.g. [\cite=xxlstoeant11], that this operator is bounded, if and only if the sequence forms a Bessel sequence. It is invertible on all of [formula] if and only if the sequence is a Riesz sequence.

Multipliers

In this work the operator that consists of a multiplication by a given function is important.

For [formula] we can give the following result, which is either known, see e.g. [\cite=conw1] or can be easily proved:

Let [formula] be the operator [formula].

φ∈L∞ if and only if Mφ is bounded. In this case [formula].

Assume there exist p,P > 0 such that p  ≤  |φ(x)|  ≤  P for almost all x∈supp(φ). Then [formula] and [formula]. On supp(φ) we have

[formula]

Mφ is boundedly invertible if and only if there exists p > 0 such that p  ≤  |φ(x)| a.e.

Main results

For regular frames of translates the Gramian function is a very important concept. For the case of irregular frames of translates, where we have no group structure, we introduce the following notion. Surprisingly, as we will see in Section [\ref=sec:gramirreg0] and Section [\ref=sec:operbaseirreg0], this definition leads to quite analogous results as in the regular case, where this function is used only in a periodized version.

Among them we show the following:

Let [formula] such that supp() is compact. If one of the following conditions is fulfilled, the other two are equivalent

[formula] is a frame for L2(supp()).

[formula] is a frame for PWsupp().

There exist p,P  >  0 such that p  ≤  Φ  ≤  P a.e. on supp().

[formula] is a frame sequence in L2(supp()).

[formula] is a frame sequence in PWsupp().

There exist p,P  >  0 such that p  ≤  Φ  ≤  P a.e. on supp().

[formula] is a Riesz sequence in L2(supp()).

[formula] is a Riesz sequence in PWsupp().

There exist p,P  >  0 such that p  ≤  Φ  ≤  P a.e.

Furthermore we can give an explicit form for the canonical dual of an irregular set of translates, as a nice generalization of results in the regular case:

Let [formula] such that supp() is compact. Assume that there exist p,P > 0 such that p  ≤  Φ  ≤  P a.e. on supp() and let [formula] be a frame sequence in L2(supp()). Then the canonical dual of [formula] is [formula] where

[formula]

In particular if [formula] is an A-tight frame, then θk  =  Tλkθ with [formula] (on supp()).

Gramian function for irregular frames of translates

In this section we will show some results about sufficient and necessary conditions on the pseudo-Gramian function for Bessel sequence and Riesz basis properties.

As a connection of the pseudo-Gramian function with the Gramian matrix we get the following result.

Let [formula] For any system of translates [formula] the Gramian matrix G has the entries

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

As a consequence of Schur's test, see e.g. [\cite=gr01] and the properties of the Gram matrix we get:

On the other hand using [\cite=cron71] the following can be shown:

For Riesz bases we obtain the following result:

Let [formula] . If

[formula]

then the system of translates [formula] is a Riesz sequence.

As [formula] we have

[formula]

Furthermore, by assumption

[formula]

The diagonal dominance (see e.g. [\cite=gr01]) implies the invertibility of the Gram matrix operator on all of [formula], which gives the desired result.

The operator-based approach to irregular frames of translates

Irregular translates in PWE

From now on we will assume φ∈PWE.

We define the subspaces in L2(E):

[formula].

[formula]

[formula].

[formula].

HΛ, FΛ and V are clearly closed subspaces. If {eλk  ·  χE} is a complete set, HΛ  =  L2(E).

Analogous as in [\cite=xxlhein10] the following can be proved.

Assume [formula] is a Bessel sequence of L2(E) with bound Be and there exists P > 0 such that Φ(ω)  ≤  P a.e. Then [formula] is a Bessel sequence for [formula] with bound Bφ  =  Be  ·  P.

Let [formula] be a Bessel sequence for [formula] with bound Bφ, and assume there exists p > 0 such that Φ(ω)  ≥  p a.e. in E. Then [formula] is a Bessel sequence for L2(E) with bound Be  =  Bφ  /  p.

The following result generalizes Lemmas 7.2.1 and 7.3.2 in [\cite=ole1].

Let [formula] be a Bessel sequence for L2(E) and assume there exists P > 0 such that Φ(ω)  ≤  P a.e. Let [formula] Then [formula] converges unconditionally in [formula] and [formula] converges unconditionally in L2(E) and

[formula]

Therefore HΛ  ·    =  F(RDφ). f∈RDφ (and [formula]) if and only if there exists F∈HΛ (F∈EΛ, respectively) such that f  =  F  ·  .

Following Lemma [\ref=sec:besbesirreg1] [formula] is a Bessel sequence and so all involved sums converge unconditionally.

[formula]

As [formula] is bounded the multiplication operator [formula] is also bounded and therefore

[formula]

In this case V  =  RD. We see from the proof of Lemma [\ref=sec:exptranslat1] that [formula].

Relation of operators

In this section we state the relations of the operators of the set of exponentials and the system of translates.

Let [formula] be a Bessel sequence of L2(E) and assume that there exists P > 0 such that Φ(ω)  ≤  P a.e. Then [formula] is a Bessel sequence of L2(E) and

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=sec:besbesirreg1] [formula] is a Bessel sequence for PWE. For [formula] by Lemma [\ref=sec:exptranslat1],

[formula]

For f∈PWE,

[formula]

So

[formula]

and

[formula]

In particular we have that RDφ  ⊆  F- 1L2(supp()).

Let [formula] be a frame of L2(supp()), and assume there exist p,P > 0 such that p  ≤  Φ  ≤  P a.e. on supp(). Then [formula] is a frame sequence with span PWsupp(). Furthermore

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover pA(opt)e  ≤  A(opt)φ  ≤  A(opt)eP.

By Proposition [\ref=sec:LTmult1] [formula] is invertible on L2(supp()), and therefore [formula] is invertible on PWsupp(), and

[formula]

Note that F maps PWE onto L2(E) and [formula] maps L2(E) onto L2(supp()), with [formula] Therefore [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=sec:exptranslat1], RDφ  ⊆  PWsupp() and since [formula] is a frame for L2(supp()), we know that RDφ  =  PWsupp(). Now [formula] implies [formula] And RDe  =  L2(supp()).

Therefore, [formula] and so [formula].

So

[formula]

Finally,

[formula]

And

[formula]

Furthermore, we can state the following result about the exactness of sequences of translates and sequences of exponentials.

Lemma [\ref=sec:relopirr1] yields ker De  ⊆   ker Dφ.

If || is bounded from above and below, then [formula] is invertible and so by Lemma [\ref=sec:relopirr2], part [\ref=Extrf] follows.

We can now proof one of the theorems stated in Section [\ref=mainres0], a generalization of results in [\cite=xxlhein10].

(1) Since [formula] is bounded from above and from below, [formula] is invertible and so by Lemma [\ref=sec:relopirr1] [formula].

Theorem 4.1 in [\cite=xxlhein10] implies [formula] .

If De and Dφ are surjective as well as Ce and Cφ are injective, [formula] is bijective and so the last direction is shown.

(2) As the ranges of the operators correspond, the proof is the same as (1).

(3) follows from Corollary [\ref=sec:transexpexact1] applied to E = supp() and (1) .

Observe that Proposition [\ref=sec:irreggram1] follows also from the equation Gφ  =  CφDφ  =  CeMΦDe in Lemma [\ref=sec:relopirr1].

Using Theorem [\ref=pe_new], we can generalize Proposition 7.3.6. in [\cite=ole1] in the following sense:

The canonical dual

We arrive to the relation between the canonical duals of frame sequences of exponentials and frame sequences of translates stated in Theorem [\ref=sec:irregdual1].

By Lemma [\ref=sec:relopirr2]

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=sec:relopirr1] we obtain:

The following Corollary shows the relation between the analysis and synthesis operator of the duals of the shifts and of the exponentials.

Now let us investigate the operator S1 / 2.

Let Φ  =  1 a.e. Then [formula].

Let [formula] form an Ae-tight frame of L2(E). Then [formula].

1. With the assumption [formula] is a unitary operator. Therefore

[formula]

2. By Corollary [\ref=sec:irregframoptight], Sφ  =  F- 1MAe||2F, and so [formula].

Let [formula] be a frame for L2(supp()), and assume there exist p,P > 0 such that p  ≤  Φ  ≤  P a.e. on supp(). Set

[formula]

where we denote the canonical tight frame of [formula] by [formula]. Then [formula] forms a Parseval frame with the same span as [formula]. The frames [formula] and [formula] are equivalent.

If [formula] forms an Ae-tight frame, then [formula] forms a tight frame of translates with shifts λk and generator [formula].

By [\cite=xxlhein10] θ#k is a frame sequence. Clearly [formula]. For f∈PWsupp(),

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore S  =  Id and [formula]. The equivalence follows from the fact that by assumption [formula] is a bijection and so RCθ#k  =  RCTλkφ.

The result follows from Lemma [\ref=sec:relopirr2].
