Boundedness of vector-valued intrinsic square functions in Morrey type spaces

Introduction and main results

The intrinsic square functions were first introduced by Wilson in [\cite=wilson1] [\cite=wilson2]; they are defined as follows. For [formula], let Cα be the family of functions φ defined on [formula] such that φ has support containing in [formula], [formula], and for all [formula], For [formula] and [formula], we set

[formula]

Then we define the intrinsic square function of f (of order α) by the formula

[formula]

where Γ(x) denotes the usual cone of aperture one: Let [formula] be a sequence of locally integrable functions on [formula]. For any [formula], Wilson [\cite=wilson2] also defined the vector-valued intrinsic square functions of [formula] by

[formula]

In [\cite=wilson2], Wilson has established the following two theorems.

If we take w∈A1, then M(w)(x)  ≤  C  ·  w(x) for a.e.[formula] by the definition of A1 weights (see Section 2). Hence, as a straightforward consequence of Theorem , we obtain

In particular, if we take w to be a constant function, then we immediately get the following

On the other hand, the classical Morrey spaces Lp,λ were originally introduced by Morrey in [\cite=morrey] to study the local behavior of solutions to second order elliptic partial differential equations. Since then, these spaces play an important role in studying the regularity of solutions to partial differential equations. For the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator, the fractional integral operator and the Calderón-Zygmund singular integral operator on these spaces, we refer the reader to [\cite=adams] [\cite=chiarenza] [\cite=peetre]. In [\cite=mizuhara], Mizuhara introduced the generalized Morrey spaces Lp,Φ which was later extended and studied by many authors (see [\cite=guliyev1] [\cite=guliyev2] [\cite=guliyev3] [\cite=lu] [\cite=nakai]). In [\cite=komori], Komori and Shirai defined the weighted Morrey spaces Lp,κ(w) which could be viewed as an extension of weighted Lebesgue spaces, and then discussed the boundedness of the above classical operators in Harmonic Analysis on these weighted spaces. Recently, in [\cite=wang1] [\cite=wang2] [\cite=wang3], we have established the strong type and weak type estimates for intrinsic square functions on Lp,Φ and Lp,κ(w).

For the boundedness of vector-valued intrinsic square functions in the weighted Morrey spaces Lp,κ(w) for all 1  ≤  p <   ∞   and 0 < κ < 1, we will prove

Let [formula], 1 < p <   ∞  , 0 < κ < 1 and w∈Ap. Then there is a constant C > 0 independent of [formula] such that

Let [formula], p = 1, 0 < κ < 1 and w∈A1. Then there is a constant C > 0 independent of [formula] such that

For the continuity properties of [formula] in Lp,Φ for all 1  ≤  p <   ∞  , we will show that

Let [formula] and 1 < p <   ∞  . Assume that Φ satisfies () and 1  ≤  D(Φ) < 2n, then there is a constant C > 0 independent of [formula] such that

Let [formula] and p = 1. Assume that Φ satisfies () and 1  ≤  D(Φ) < 2n, then there is a constant C > 0 independent of [formula] such that

Definition

Generalized Morrey spaces

Let Φ  =  Φ(r), r > 0, be a growth function, that is, a positive increasing function in (0,  ∞  ) and satisfy the following doubling condition.

[formula]

where [formula] is a doubling constant independent of r.

Let 1  ≤  p <   ∞  . We denote by [formula] the space of all locally integrable functions f defined on [formula], such that for every [formula] and all r > 0

[formula]

where [formula] is the ball centered at x0 and with radius r > 0. Then we let [formula] be the smallest constant C > 0 satisfying ([\ref=generalized_morrey]) and [formula] becomes a Banach space with norm [formula].

Obviously, when Φ(r) = rλ with 0 < λ < n, Lp,Φ is just the classical Morrey spaces introduced in [\cite=morrey]. We also denote by [formula] the generalized weak Morrey spaces of all measurable functions f for which

[formula]

for every [formula] and all r > 0. The smallest constant C > 0 satisfying ([\ref=general_weak_morrey]) is also denoted by [formula].

Weighted Morrey spaces

A weight w is a nonnegative, locally integrable function on [formula], B = B(x0,rB) denotes the ball with the center x0 and radius rB. For 1 < p <   ∞  , a weight function w is said to belong to Ap, if there is a constant C > 0 such that for every ball [formula], For the case p = 1, w∈A1, if there is a constant C > 0 such that for every ball [formula], A weight function w∈A∞ if it satisfies the Ap condition for some 1  ≤  p <   ∞  . It is well known that if w∈Ap with 1  ≤  p <   ∞  , then for any ball B, there exists an absolute constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

Moreover, if w∈A∞, then for all balls B and all measurable subsets E of B, there exists δ > 0 such that

[formula]

Given a ball B and λ > 0, λB denotes the ball with the same center as B whose radius is λ times that of B. For a given weight function w and a measurable set E, we also denote the Lebesgue measure of E by |E| and the weighted measure of E by w(E), where [formula].

Given a weight function w on [formula], for 1  ≤  p <   ∞  , the weighted Lebesgue space [formula] defined as the set of all functions f such that

[formula]

We also denote by [formula] the weighted weak space consisting of all measurable functions f such that

[formula]

In particular, for w equals to a constant function, we shall denote [formula] and [formula] simply by [formula] and [formula].

Let 1  ≤  p <   ∞  , 0 < κ < 1 and w be a weight function on [formula]. Then the weighted Morrey space is defined by where

[formula]

and the supremum is taken over all balls B in [formula].

For p = 1 and 0 < κ < 1, we also denote by WL1,κ(w) the weighted weak Morrey spaces of all measurable functions f satisfying

[formula]

Throughout this paper, the letter C always denote a positive constant independent of the main parameters involved, but it may be different from line to line.

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=mainthm:1] and [\ref=mainthm:2]

Let [formula] with 1 < p <   ∞   and 0 < κ < 1. Fix a ball [formula] and decompose fj = f0j + f∞j, where f0j = fj  ·  χ2B and χ2B denotes the characteristic function of 2B = B(x0,2rB), [formula]. Then we write Using Theorem A and the inequality ([\ref=weights]), we have Let us now turn to estimate the other term I2. For any φ∈Cα, [formula], [formula] and (y,t)∈Γ(x), we have

[formula]

For any x∈B, (y,t)∈Γ(x) and [formula], then by a direct computation, we can easily see that

[formula]

Thus, by using the above inequalities ([\ref=ineq:5.1]) and ([\ref=ineq:5.2]) together with Minkowski's inequality for integrals, we deduce Then by duality and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we get

[formula]

Furthermore, it follows from Hölder's inequality, ([\ref=key_estimate]) and the Ap condition that where we denote the conjugate exponent of p > 1 by p' = p / (p  -  1). Since w∈Ap  ⊂  A∞ for all 1 < p <   ∞  . Hence, we apply the inequality ([\ref=compare]) to obtain where the last series is convergent since 0 < κ < 1 and δ > 0. Summarizing the above two estimates for I1 and I2, and then taking the supremum over all balls [formula], we complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm:1].

Let [formula] with 0 < κ < 1. Fix a ball [formula], we set fj = f0j + f∞j, where f0j = fj  ·  χ2B, [formula] Then for any given λ > 0, one writes Theorem B and the inequality ([\ref=weights]) imply that We now turn to deal with the other term I'2. In the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm:1], we have already showed that for any x∈B (see ([\ref=key_estimate])), It follows directly from the A1 condition that In addition, since w∈A1  ⊂  A∞, then by the inequality ([\ref=compare]), we can see that for all x∈B,

[formula]

where in the last inequality we have used the fact that δ*  ·  (1 - κ) > 0. If [formula], then the inequality holds trivially. Now if instead we suppose that

[formula]

Then by the pointwise inequality ([\ref=pointwise]), we have which is equivalent to Therefore Summing up the above estimates for I'1 and I'2, and then taking the supremum over all balls [formula] and all λ > 0, we finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm:2].

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=mainthm:3] and [\ref=mainthm:4]

Let [formula] with 1 < p <   ∞  . For any ball [formula] with [formula] and r > 0, we write fj = f0j + f∞j, where f0j = fj  ·  χ2B, [formula]. Then we have Applying Theorem C and the doubling condition ([\ref=doubling]), we obtain We now turn to estimate the other term J2. We first use the inequality ([\ref=key_estimate]) and Hölder's inequality to obtain Hence Since 1  ≤  D(Φ) < 2n, then by using the doubling condition ([\ref=doubling]) of Φ, we know that

[formula]

Therefore Combining the above estimates for J1 and J2, and then taking the supremum over all balls [formula], we complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm:3].

Let [formula]. For each fixed ball [formula], we again decompose fj as fj = f0j + f∞j, where f0j = fj  ·  χ2B, [formula]. For any given λ > 0, then we write Theorem D and the doubling condition ([\ref=doubling]) imply that We turn our attention to the estimate of J'2. Using the preceding estimate ([\ref=key_estimate]), we can deduce that for all x∈B(x0,r), Note that 1  ≤  D(Φ) < 2n. Arguing as in the proof of ([\ref=C]), we can get

[formula]

Hence, for any x∈B(x0,r),

[formula]

If [formula], then the inequality holds trivially. Now we may suppose that

[formula]

Then by the pointwise inequality ([\ref=pointwise2]), we can see that which is equivalent to Therefore Summing up the above estimates for J'1 and J'2, and then taking the supremum over all balls [formula] and all λ > 0, we conclude the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm:4].
