Automorphism tower problem and semigroup of endomorphisms for free Burnside groups

Corollary

Introduction.

If the center of a group G is trivial, then it is embedded into the group of its automorphisms Aut(G). Such embedding is given by mapping each element of group to the inner automorphism generated by this element. The inner automorphism generated by an element g∈G is denoted by ig and is defined by the formula xig = gxg- 1 for all x∈G (the image of the element x under the map α is denoted by xα). The easily verifiable relation for composition of automorphisms [formula] shows that the group of all inner automorphisms Inn(G) is a normal subgroup in Aut(G). Moreover, the relation [formula] implies that in a group G with trivial center the centralizer of the subgroup Inn(G) is also trivial in Aut(G). In particular, the group Aut(G) is also a centerless group. This allows to consider the automorphism tower

[formula]

where Gk = Aut(Gk - 1) and Gk is identified with Inn(Gk) under the embedding [formula], g  ↦  ig (k = 1,2,...).

According to classical Wielandt's theorem (see [\cite=Rob]), the automorphism tower [\eqref=tow] of any finite centerless group terminates after a finite number of steps (that is there exists a number k such that Gk = Gk - 1). For infinite groups the analogous statement is false (for example, automorphism tower of infinite dihedral group does not terminate in finitely many steps). In early seventies G. Baumslag proposed to study the automorphism tower for absolutely free and for some relatively free groups. In particular, he formulated a hypothesis that the tower of absolutely free group of finite rank should be "very short".

In 1975 J. Dyer and E. Formanek in [\cite=DF] confirmed the Baumsalag's hypothesis proving that if F is a free group of finite rank > 1, then its group of automorphisms Aut(F) is complete. Recall that a group is called complete, if it is centerless and each of its automorphisms is inner. V. Tolstikh in [\cite=T] proved the completeness of Aut(F) for free groups F of infinite rank. It is clear that if the group of automorphisms of centerless group G0 is complete, then its automorphism tower terminates after the first step, that is, [formula]

The later new proofs and various generalizations of Dayer-Formanek theorem have been obtained by E. Formanek [\cite=F], D.G. Khramtsov [\cite=Kh], M.R. Bridson and K. Vogtmann [\cite=BV].

Further, in [\cite=26] and [\cite=24] it was established that the group of automorphisms of each non-abelian free solvable group of finite rank is complete. It was showed that the group of automorphisms of free nilpotent group of class 2 and rank r  ≥  2 is complete provided that [formula]. In the case n = 3 the height of the automorphism tower [\eqref=tow] is 2.

Note that in all above-mentioned results on automorphism tower of relatively free groups only torsion free groups were considered.

Preliminary and the main results.

We study the automorphism tower of free Burnside groups B(m,n), i.e. the relatively free groups of rank m > 1 of the variety of all groups which satisfy the identity xn = 1. The group B(m,n) is the quotient group of absolutely free group Fm on m generators by normal subgroup Fnm generated by all n-th powers. Obviously, any periodic group of exponent n with m generators is a quotient group of B(m,n). By the theorem of S.I. Adian, the group B(m,n) of rank m > 1 is infinite for any odd [formula]. This Theorem and a series of fundamental properties of B(m,n), was proved in the monograph [\cite=A]. A comprehensive survey of results about the free Burnside groups and related topics is given in the paper [\cite=UMN].

Our main result states that the automorphism tower of non-cyclic free Burnside group B(m,n) is terminated on the first step for any odd n  ≥  1003. Hence, the automorphism tower problem for groups B(m,n) is solved. We is show that it is as short as the automorphism tower of the absolutely free groups. In particular, the group Aut(B(m,n)) is complete. The inequality n  ≥  1003 for the exponent n is closely related to the result in the last chapter of monograph [\cite=A], concerning the construction of an infinite independent system of group identities in two variables (the solution of the finite basis problem). Based on the developed technique in this chapter in [\cite=AL] the authors have constructed an infinite simple group of period n with cyclic subgroups for each n  ≥  1003, which plays a key role in our proof of the main result. The use of simple quotient groups to obtain information about the automorphisms of B(m,n) first occurs in the paper [\cite=O03] of A.Yu.Olshanskii. We are pleased to stress the influence of [\cite=O03] on our research.

The well known Gelder-Bear's theorem asserts that every complete group is a direct factor in any group in which it is contained as a normal subgroup (see [\cite=Rob]). According to Adian's theorem (see [\cite=A]) for any odd [formula] the center of (non-cyclic) free Burnside group is trivial. However, the groups B(m,n) are not complete, because, for example, the automorphism φ of B(m,n), defined on the free generators by the formula [formula], is an outer automorphism.

Nevertheless, the free Burnside groups possess a property analogous to the above-mentioned characteristic property of complete groups. It turns out that each group B(m,n) is a direct factor in every periodic group of exponent n, in which it is contained as a normal subgroup. This statement was proved for large enough odd n (n > 1080) by E. Cherepanov in [\cite=Cher] and for all odd n  ≥  1003 by the author in [\cite=Ata11].

Our main result is the following

For any odd [formula] and m > 1, the group of all inner automorphisms Inn(B(m,n)) is the unique normal subgroup of the group Aut(B(m,n)) among all subgroups, which are isomorphic to a free Burnside group B(s,n) of some rank s.

The proof of this result is essentially based on the papers [\cite=Af09]-[\cite=A13] of the author.

Theorem [\ref=2] immediately implies the following

The groups of automorphisms Aut(B(m,n)) and Aut(B(k,n)) are isomorphic if and only if m = k (for any odd [formula]).

By Burnside criterion, if the group of all inner automorphisms Inn(G) of a centerless group G is a characteristic subgroup in Aut(G), then Aut(G) is complete (see [\cite=Rob]). Since the image of the subgroup Inn(B(m,n)) under every automorphism of the group Aut(B(m,n)) is a normal subgroup, Theorem [\ref=2] implies

The group of automorphisms Aut(B(m,n)) of the free Burnside group B(m,n) is complete for any odd [formula] and m > 1.

It should be emphasized that the group Aut(B(m,n)) is saturated with a lot of subgroups, which are isomorphic to some free Burnside group. It is known that each non-cyclic subgroup of B(m,n), and hence the group Inn(B(m,n)), contains a subgroup isomorphic to the free Burnside group B(  ∞  ,n) of infinite rank (see [\cite=A09]). Furthermore, Aut(B(m,n)) contains free periodic subgroups having trivial intersection with Inn(B(m,n)) for m > 2. For instance, consider a subgroup of Aut(B(m,n)) generated by automorphisms lj, j = 2,...,m, defined on generators ai, i = 1,...,m, by formulae lj(a1) = a1aj and lj(ak) = ak for k = 2,...,m. It is easy to check the equality

[formula]

for any word W(a2,...,am). Then, the automorphism W(l2,...,lm) is the identity automorphism if and only if the equality W(a2,...,am) = 1 holds in B(m,n). Hence, the automorphisms l1j, j = 2,...,m generate a subgroup isomorphic to free Burnside group B(m - 1,n) of rank m - 1. According to Theorem [\ref=2], none of the above-mentioned subgroups is a normal subgroup of Aut(B(m,n)).

A detailed proof of the above-mentioned results see [\cite=ijac]

Using the completeness of Aut(B(m,n)), we have also obtained a description of the group of automorphisms Aut(End(B(m,n))) for endomorphism's semigroup of B(m,n). Our result is the following

If S:End(B(m,n))  →  End(B(m,n)) is an automorphism of the semigroup End(B(m,n)), then there is an α∈Aut(B(m,n)) such that [formula] for all β∈End(B(m,n)), where n  ≥  1003 is arbitrary odd period and m > 1.

E.Formanek proved the analogus statement for absolutely free groups of finite rank (see [\cite=FP]). Note that the question about the description of Aut(End(F)) for relatively free groups has been posed by B.Plotkin (see [\cite=MP]).
