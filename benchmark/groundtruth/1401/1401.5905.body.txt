On a generalization of criteria A and D for congruence of triangles

Introduction

There are six essential elements of every triangle - three angles and three sides. The method of constructing a triangle varies according to the facts which are known about its sides and angles.

It is important to know what is the minimum knowledge about the sides and angles which is necessary to construct a particular triangle.

Clearly all triangles constructed in the same way with the same data must be identically equal, i. e. they must be of exactly the same size and shape and their areas must be the same.

Triangles which are equal in all respects are called congruent triangles.

The four sets of minimal conditions for two triangles to be congruent are set out in the following geometric criteria.

Criterion A. Two triangles are congruent if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are respectively equal to two sides and the included angle of the other.

Criterion B. Two triangles are congruent if two angles and a side of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles and a side of the other.

Criterion C. Two triangles are congruent if the three sides of one triangle are respectively equal to the three sides of the other.

Criterion D. Two triangles are congruent if two sides and the angle opposite the greater side of one triangle are respectively equal to two sides and the angle opposite the greater side of the other.

It should be noted that in criteria A and D the sets of corresponding equal elements are two sides and an angle.

In fact the angle given may be any one of the three angles of the triangle. The problem to "Construct a triangle with two of its sides   a   and   b,   a < b, and angle   α   opposite the smaller side" has not a unique solution. There can be two triangles each of them satisfying the given conditions.

In the present paper we compare not congruent triangles with respect to given sets of corresponding elements and answer the question what are the geometric properties characterizing such couples of triangles.

Theoretical basis of the proposed method for comparing triangles

In [formula] and [formula] it is convenient to use the notations   AB = c,   BC = a,   CA = b;   A1B1 = c1,   B1C1 = a1,   C1A1 = b1. Let   θ   and   θ1   be two corresponding angles of these triangles.

If for [formula] and [formula] the relations a = a1,  b = b1 and θ  =  θ1 between the corresponding elements hold, we consider the following cases.

The angle θ is included between the sides a and b, i. e. [formula], and respectively [formula]. In this case the triangles are congruent in view of Criterion A.

Let a = b and correspondingly a1 = b1, i. e. [formula] and [formula] are isosceles. Since θ  =  θ1, the triangles are congruent as a consequence of Criterion A.

Let a  >  b, correspondingly a1  >  b1, and the angle θ is opposite the greater side a. In this case the triangles are congruent in view of Criterion D.

Let a  >  b, correspondingly a1  >  b1, and the angle θ is opposite the smaller side b. In this case the triangles are either congruent or not.

If the triangles are congruent, then the angles opposite the greater sides are necessarily equal.

It could happen that the sum of the equal angles opposite the greater sides is two right angles. If so, the triangles are right-angled.

If the triangles are not congruent, then we show that the sum of the angles opposite the greater sides is always two right angles.

We prove the following

Let [formula] and [formula] be not congruent triangles having AB as a common side. Let also AC = AD. If [formula], then [formula].

Proof. Since [formula] and [formula] are not congruent, then AC < AB (and hence AD < AB). Let us denote [formula] and [formula]. There are two possibilities for the location of [formula] and [formula] with respect to the straight line AB.

(i) The points C and D lie on opposite sides of AB.

The symmetry with respect to the straight line AB transforms [formula] into its congruent [formula] which lies on one and the same side of the axis of symmetry AB like [formula] (fig. 1). Since [formula], then [formula]. The condition [formula] states that the straight line AB is the bisector of [formula]. From the symmetry with respect to AB it follows that G∈BC and BG  ≠  BC. Let, for instance, G / BC. (The case C / BG is analogical.) It is clear that if the conditions of Lemma 2.1 are fulfilled for [formula] and [formula], then they are also valid for [formula] and [formula] and vice versa.

Let us consider [formula] and [formula]. The side AB and [formula] are common for both triangles. In view of the symmetry with respect to AB and AC = AD, we get AD = AG = AC. Hence, [formula] is isosceles and [formula]. The angles [formula] and [formula] are adjacent and hence [formula].

The quadrilateral ACBD can be inscribed in a circle.

(ii) The points C and D lie on one and the same side of AB.

We consider [formula] and [formula] (in this case [formula]). The proof of the statement is as in (i).

If [formula] and [formula] are not congruent, the relations AB = A1B1,  AC = A1C1 and [formula] between their corresponding elements are fulfilled and they have no common side, then we can choose a suitable congruence and transform [formula] into its congruent [formula] so that both triangles satisfy the conditions of Lemma 2.1.

Based on the above arguments we can formulate a theorem, which is a generalization of criteria A and D for congruence of triangles (see also [\cite=Sch], p. 12).

The denotations AB = c,   BC = a,   CA = b; A1B1 = c1,   B1C1 = a1,   C1A1 = b1 are usually used in [formula] and [formula] respectively.

Let θ and θ1 be two corresponding angles of [formula] and [formula]. If a = a1,  b = b1 and θ  =  θ1, then [formula] and [formula] are either congruent, or not congruent but the sum of the other two angles, not included between the given sides, is two right angles.

Lemma 2.1 and Theorem 2.4 can be used as alternative methods of comparing different triangles.

Application of Theorem 2.4 to two geometric problems

The solutions of next selected problems are based on Theorem 2.4.

([\cite=NM2], problems 4.20 and 4.23; [\cite=T]) Let the middle points of the sides BC, CA and AB of [formula] be F, D, and E respectively. If the center G of the circumscribing circle k of [formula] lies on the bisector of [formula], then [formula] is either isosceles (CA = CB), or not isosceles but [formula].

Proof. It is given that the center G of the circumscribing circle k of [formula] lies on the bisector of [formula] (fig. 2).

Since [formula] and [formula] have a common side CG, equal corresponding angles [formula] and equal corresponding sides DG = FG (as radii of k), the conditions of Theorem 2.4 are satisfied. Then [formula] and [formula] are either congruent, or not congruent.

(i) If [formula] and [formula] are congruent, then CD = CF and hence CA = CB, i. e. [formula] is isosceles.

There are two possibilities for [formula]:

either [formula] and [formula] is equilateral,

or [formula] and [formula] is isosceles.

(ii) If [formula] and [formula] are not congruent, then in view of Lemma 2.1 [formula] and the quadrilateral CDGF can be inscribed in a circle k' (fig. 2).

It is easy to be seen that [formula] and the circumscribing circles k and k' have equal radii. The circles k and k' are symmetrically located with respect to their common chord FD. Since the center G of k lies on k', then the center G' of k' lies on k. Hence, [formula], both triangles are equilateral, [formula] and [formula].

([\cite=NM1], Problem 8; [\cite=NM2], Problem 4.12) Let in [formula] the straight lines AA1,  A1∈BC, and BB1,  B1∈AC, be the bisectors of [formula] and [formula] respectively. Let also [formula]. If JA1 = JB1 then [formula] is either isosceles   (CA  =  CB), or not isosceles but [formula].

Proof. We use the denotations [formula], [formula], [formula].

Since J is the cut point of the angle bisectors   AA1   and   BB1   of [formula], then the straight line CJ is the bisector of [formula] and α  +  β  +  γ = 900 (fig. 3).

Since [formula] is an exterior angle of [formula], then [formula]. Since [formula] is an exterior angle of [formula], then [formula].

Let us compare [formula] and [formula]. They have a common side CJ, corresponding equal sides JA1 = JB1 and angles [formula].

The conditions of Theorem 2.4 are satisfied. Then [formula] and [formula] are either congruent, or not.

(i) If [formula] and [formula] are congruent, then their corresponding elements are equal, in particular

[formula]

Hence, [formula] is isosceles with CA = CB.

There are two possibilities for [formula]:

[formula] and [formula] is equilateral;

[formula] and [formula] is isosceles.

(ii) If [formula] and [formula] are not congruent, then with respect to Lemma 2.1

[formula]

Hence, [formula].

Groups of problems

In this section we illustrate the composing technology of new problems as an interpretation of specific logical models.

Our aim is the basic problem in each of the groups under consideration to be with (exclusive or not exclusive) disjunction as a logical structure in the conclusion and its proof to be based on Lemma 2.1 or on Theorem 2.4.

Problems of group I

Suitable logical models for formulation of equivalent problems and generating problems of a given problem are described in detail in [\cite=NM1] [\cite=NM2].

The basic statements we need in this group of problems are:

t: = { A square with center O is inscribed in a [formula] in the following way: the vertexes of the square lie on the sides of the triangle, in addition two of them lie on the side AB.}

[formula]

q: = {CA = CB}

[formula]

We describe the logical scheme for the composition of the Basic problem 4.4, which has not exclusive disjunction as a logical structure in the conclusion:

First we formulate and prove the generating problems - Problem 4.1 with logical structure [formula] and Problem 4.3 with logical structure [formula].

To generate problems with logical structure [formula] we use the logical equivalence

[formula]

Finally, the formulated inverse problem - Basic problem 4.4 - to the problem with structure ( * ) has the logical structure [formula].

In [formula] is inscribed a square with center O in the following way: the vertexes of the square lie on the sides of the triangle, in addition two of them lie on the side AB. Prove that if [formula], then [formula].

Proof. Let the quadrilateral MNPQ, M∈AB,   N∈AB,   P∈BC,   Q∈AC, be the inscribed in [formula] square (fig. 4). Since the diagonals of a square are equal, intersect at right angles, bisect each other and bisect the opposite angles, then OP = OQ and [formula]. The quadrilateral OPCQ can be inscribed in a circle k with diameter PQ. To the equal chords OQ and OP of k correspond equal angles, i. e. [formula].

In [formula] is inscribed a rectangle with center O in the following way: the vertexes of the rectangle lie on the sides of the triangle, in addition two of them lie on the side AB. Prove that if CA = CB, then [formula].

Proof. Let the quadrilateral MNPQ, M∈AB,   N∈AB,   P∈BC,   Q∈AC, be the inscribed in [formula] rectangle (fig. 5). Since the diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other, then OM = ON = OP = OQ.

Let [formula]. Provided that [formula] is isosceles with CA = CB, the point H is the middle point of AB and the straight line CH is the bisector of [formula].

Because [formula] and MQ = NP, it follows that [formula] (by Criterion B) and AM = BN. Hence, H is also the middle point of MN. Since [formula] is isosceles, then its median OH is also an altitude, i. e. [formula]. This means that O∈CH and [formula].

A special case of Problem 4.2 is Problem 4.3 with a logical structure [formula].

In [formula] is inscribed a square with center O in the following way: the vertexes of the square lie on the sides of the triangle, in addition two of them lie on the side AB. Prove that if CA = CB, then [formula].

Now we formulate and prove the Basic problem in this group.

Proof. Let the quadrilateral MNPQ, M∈AB,   N∈AB,   P∈BC,   Q∈AC, be the inscribed in [formula] square (fig. 6). Since the diagonals of any square are equal, intersect at right angles, bisect each other and bisect the opposite angles, then OP = OQ and [formula].

We compare [formula] and [formula]. They have a common side CO, respectively equal sides OQ = OP and angles [formula]. We compute that [formula] and [formula] as exterior angles of [formula] and [formula] respectively.

In view of Theorem 2.4 [formula] and [formula] are either congruent or not.

If [formula] and [formula] are congruent, then [formula] and hence [formula], i. e. CA = CB and [formula] is isosceles.

In this case [formula] is either a right angle and [formula] is isosceles right-angled, or not a right angle and [formula] is only isosceles.

If [formula] and [formula] are not congruent then, in view of Lemma 2.1, [formula] and hence [formula], i. e. [formula] is right-angled with [formula].

A logically incorrect version of the Basic problem 4.4 is Problem 1.54 in [\cite=KL].

We reformulate Problem 4.4 by keeping the condition of homogeneity of the conclusion.

In [formula] is inscribed a square with center O in the following way: the vertexes of the square lie on the sides of the triangle, in addition two of them lie on the side AB. Prove that if [formula], then [formula] is either isosceles with CA = CB, or not isosceles but right-angled with [formula].

Problems of group II

By formulating appropriate statements and giving suitable logical models we get two generating problems that are necessary for the construction of the Basic problem 4.9.

The basic statements we need are:

t: = {In [formula] the straight lines AA1,  A1∈BC, and BB1,  B1∈AC, are the bisectors of [formula] and [formula] respectively.}

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Since the sum of the angles of any triangle is equal to two right angles, the statements   p   and   q   are mutually exclusive. Hence, if   p   is true, so is [formula] and vice versa.

We describe the logical scheme for the composition of the Basic problem 4.9, which has exclusive disjunction as a logical structure in the conclusion:

First we formulate and prove the generating problems - Problem 4.7 with logical structure [formula] and Problem 4.8 with logical structure [formula].

Since the statements   p   and   q   are mutually exclusive then the equivalences [formula] and [formula] are true. As a consequence of these facts problems with logical structures [formula] and [formula] are equivalent. So the problems with logical structures [formula] and [formula].

To generate problems with logical structure [formula] we use the logical equivalence

[formula]

Finally, the formulated inverse problem - the Basic problem 4.9 - to the problem with structure ( *  * ) has the logical structure [formula].

Let in [formula] the straight lines AA1,  A1∈BC, and BB1,  B1∈AC, be the bisectors of [formula] and [formula] respectively. Prove that if [formula], then [formula].

Proof. Let [formula], [formula], [formula].

Since J is the cut point of the angle bisectors of [formula], then [formula] (fig. 7).

Because α  +  β  +  γ = 900 it follows that [formula]. Hence, the quadrilateral CA1JB1 can be inscribed in a circle. Then [formula] and [formula] as angles in the same segment of this circle.

Let in [formula] the straight lines AA1,  A1∈BC, and BB1,  B1∈AC, be the bisectors of [formula] and [formula] respectively. Prove that if [formula], then [formula].

Proof. Let [formula], [formula], [formula]. Since [formula], then its adjacent angles have a measure of 600. It is easy to be seen that the point B1 is equidistant from the straight lines BA,   BC,   AA1 and that the straight line A1B1 is the bisector of [formula] (fig. 8). The proof that the straight line A1C1 is the bisector of [formula] is analogical. It follows that [formula] is a right angle (the bisectors of any two adjacent angles are perpendicular to each other) (see also [\cite=M], p. 194, Problem 156).

As a consequence we get that E is the intersection point of the angle bisectors CJ and A1B1 of [formula] and hence [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] as an exterior angle of [formula], the sum of the angles of [formula] is 600 + 2φ + 2γ = 1800, i. e. φ  +  γ = 600 and hence [formula].

Thus, the quadrilateral AJEB1 can be inscribed in a circle. We conclude that [formula] as angles in the same segment of this circle. Hence, [formula].

Now we formulate and prove the Basic problem in this group.

Proof. Let us denote [formula], [formula], [formula].

Since J is the cut point of the angle bisectors of [formula], then the straight line CJ is the bisector of [formula]. Denoting [formula] we get α  +  β  +  γ = 900 (fig. 9).

Let the point A' be orthogonally symmetric to the point A1 with respect to the axis BB1. It follows that A'  ≠  A. (If [formula] then [formula] does not exist.) The straight line BB1 is the bisector of [formula] and consequently A'∈AB and B1A1 = B1A'. On the other hand, [formula] and hence [formula] is equilateral.

We compute [formula] (as an exterior angle of [formula]), [formula] (as an exterior angle of [formula]), [formula] and [formula].

Let us compare [formula] and [formula]. They have a common side AA1 and corresponding equal sides A1B1 = A1A' and angles [formula]. In view of Theorem 2.4 we have the possibilities:

[formula] and [formula] are congruent. Then [formula], i. e. 1200  +  γ  -  α = 900  +  β. Hence, [formula].

[formula] and [formula] are not congruent. By Lemma 2.1 it follows that [formula], i. e. (1200  +  γ  -  α) + (900  +  β) = 1800. Hence, [formula].

An alternate version of Problem 4.9 is Problem 6, p. 12, in [\cite=Sch].

In order to formulate a special type equivalent problem to this Basic problem we prove

If the statements p and q are mutually exclusive then the following equivalences are true

[formula]

Proof.

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Because of this Proposition problems with logical structures [formula] and [formula] are equivalent.

The following problem is equivalent to the Basic problem 4.9.

Let in [formula] the straight lines AA1,  A1∈BC, and BB1,  B1∈AC, be the bisectors of [formula] and [formula] respectively. Prove that if [formula] and [formula] then [formula].

Proof. Assuming the truth of the contrary statement, i. e. [formula], the solution of this problem leads to the solution of the Basic problem 4.9.
