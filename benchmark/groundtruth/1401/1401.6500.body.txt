Holographic Transformation for Quantum Factor Graphs

Introduction

The computation of the partition function is one of the most important problem in statistical physics, machine learning, computer science and information theory [\cite=mezard2009ipa]. Recently, Valiant invented the holographic transformation for transforming the expression of the partition function in order to obtain polynomial-time algorithms for planar graphs [\cite=valiant2008holographic]. The idea of the holographic transformation explains many well-known identities, e.g., high-temperature expansion, MacWilliams identity, loop calculus, etc. [\cite=forney2011partition], [\cite=chernyak2007loop], [\cite=mori2013lcn]. In this work, the holographic transformation is generalized to quantum factor graphs, which is restricted quantum graphical model suggested in [\cite=leifer2008quantum]. Although problems from quantum statistical physics are not included in our setting, a decoding problems of quantum error correcting codes can be represented by a quantum factor graph [\cite=leifer2008quantum]. Hence, the quantum generalization in this paper may be considered as the first step for generalizing loop calculus for quantum error correcting codes. This paper suggests the generalization of the holographic transformation to quantum factor graphs, but does not include any particular example.

Factor graphs

A factor graph is a bipartite graph defining a probability measure. A factor graph consists of variable nodes, factor nodes and edges between a variable node and a factor node. Let V be the set of variable nodes and F be the set of factor nodes. Let E  ⊆  V  ×  F be the set of edges. For a variable node i∈V, ∂i  ⊆  F denotes the set of neighborhoods of i. In the same way ∂a  ⊆  V is defined for a∈F. For each variable node i∈V, there is an associated finite set Xi and an associated function [formula]. For each factor node a∈F, there is an associated function [formula]. Let [formula] be variables corresponding to a subset V'  ⊆  V of variable nodes. Then, the probability measure on [formula] associated with the factor graph G = (V,F,E,(fi)i∈V,(fa)a∈F) is defined as

[formula]

Here, the constant Z(G) for the normalization is called the partition function, which plays an important role in statistical physics, machine learning, computer science and information theory [\cite=mezard2009ipa].

Holographic transformation for factor graphs

In this section, we briefly review the holographic transformation for classical factor graphs. Let Xi,a: = Xi for all (i,a)∈E. Let [formula] and [formula] be mappings for each (i,a)∈E satisfying

[formula]

where δ(x,z) takes 1 if x = z and 0 otherwise. Let [formula] Then, it holds

[formula]

where [formula]. By letting

[formula]

where [formula], one obtains

[formula]

This equality is called the Holant theorem [\cite=valiant2008holographic], [\cite=5695119], which explains many known equalities [\cite=forney2011partition].

Quantum factor graphs

There are several quantum graphical models understood as generalizations of classical factor graphs. In quantum physics, quantum state is expressed by a positive semidefinite trace-1 matrix, called a density matrix. The conventional matrix product cannot be used for factor graph directly since a product of two positive semidefinite matrices is not necessarily positive semidefinite. By considering the conditional independence for quantum states [\cite=leifer2008quantum], the most natural generalization [formula] of the products in the classical factor graph would be

[formula]

where S is the intersection of the supports of Λ and Λ', and where Λ|S and Λ'|S are the restriction of Λ and Λ', respectively, to S. Here, Λ and Λ' must be positive semidefinite. Obviously [formula] is also positive semidefinite. While the product [formula] is commutative and associative, the product [formula] is not distributive with the partial trace in general [\cite=leifer2008quantum]. Hence, in this paper, we do not deal with the quantum graphical model using the product [formula] although it includes problems from quantum statistical physics.

The Suzuki-Trotter approximation for [formula] gives a set of definitions of products [formula] as The product [formula] is obtained as the limit of [formula] While [formula] is positive semidefinite if Λ and Λ' are positive semidefinite, [formula] is neither commutative nor associative. However, [formula] is useful for guaranteeing the distributive law with the partial trace, i.e., [formula] where ΛAB and ΛBC are positive semidefinite operators acting on Hilbert spaces [formula] and [formula], respectively. Hence, in this paper, we deal with the quantum factor graph using the product [formula] defined in [\cite=leifer2008quantum]. Let V, F, E be the sets of variable nodes, factor nodes and edges as with the classical factor graph. For each variable node i∈V, there is an associated Hilbert space Hi and an associated positive semidefinite operator fi on Hi. For each factor node a∈F, there is an associated positive semidefinite operator fa on [formula]. Then, the density operator on [formula] associated with the quantum factor graph G = (V,F,E,(fi)i∈V,(fa)a∈F) is defined as where (fa)a∈F are mutually commute with respect to the conventional matrix product. In this paper, all Hilbert spaces are assumed to be finite dimensional. This quantum model includes decoding problem of quantum error correcting codes [\cite=leifer2008quantum].

Non-commutative holographic transformation for quantum factor graphs

In this section, the holographic transformation and the Holant theorem in [\cite=valiant2008holographic], [\cite=5695119], [\cite=mori2013lcn] for classical factor graphs is generalized to quantum factor graphs. Let H'i,a and i,a be new Hilbert spaces which are isomorphic to Hi. Let qi be the dimension of Hi and [formula] be a basis for Hi for all i∈V. Let f'a be the same as fa but acting on [formula] for all a∈F. Let B(HA) be the set of linear operators acting on a Hilbert space HA. The set B(HA) of linear operators can also be regarded as a linear space with respect to the conventional summation and scalar multiplication. Let Φi,a and i,a be linear maps from B(i,a) to B(Hi) and from B(H'i,a) to B(i,a), respectively, for all (i,a)∈E. For any linear map T:B(HA)  →  B(HB), there is the Choi-Jamiolkowski representation [formula] of T, i.e., which satisfies for any G∈B(HA) where IHB denotes the identity operator on HB and [formula] denotes the transpose of linear map [\cite=wolf2012quantum]. Let [formula] and [formula] be the Choi-Jamiolkowski representations for Φi,a and i,a, respectively, for all (i,a)∈E.

We assume that (Φi,a)a∈∂i are mutually commute with respect to the conventional matrix product for i∈V. Furthermore, we assume that it holds [formula] for all (i,a)∈E where for all [formula]. It is easy to verify that this condition is equivalent to

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then, one obtains

[formula]

For linear maps T:B(HA)  →  B(HB) and T':B(HC)  →  B(HB), [formula] is defined as

[formula]

Let T* be the adjoint map of T, i.e., [formula] [\cite=wolf2012quantum]. Then, one obtains

[formula]

where

[formula]

The equation [\eqref=eq:holant] can be regarded as a quantum generalization of the Holant theorem [\eqref=eq:cholant].

Note that for the classical case, (fa)a∈F and (fi)i∈V are diagonal with respect to some basis [formula]. In this case, the condition [\eqref=eq:inv0] can be replaced by a different condition for all [formula] or equivalently, If (φi,a)(i,a)∈E and (i,a)(i,a)∈E are restricted to be diagonal with respect to the same basis, the above condition corresponds to [\eqref=eq:invc].

Loop calculus and quantum belief propagation

In this section, we assume that φi,a and i,a are Hermitian for all (i,a)∈E. The condition [formula] is equivalent to [formula] and also to For loop calculus, we further requires the following conditions for fixing Φi,a and i,a [\cite=chernyak2007loop], [\cite=mori2013lcn]
