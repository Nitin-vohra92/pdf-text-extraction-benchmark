Introduction

Let Γ  <  (2,1) be a non-elementary complex hyperbolic Kleinian group. The trace field of Γ is the field generated by the traces of all the elements of Γ over the base field [formula]. Maskit [\cite=Ma] characterized non-elementary hyperbolic Kleinian groups of [formula] whose trace fields are contained in [formula]. The condition that the trace field of Γ is contained in [formula] is equivalent to that [formula] for all γ∈Γ. In [\cite=FLW], X. Fu, L. Li and X. Wang showed that if [formula] for all γ∈Γ, then Γ is Fuchsian. Here, a complex hyperbolic Kleinian group in dimension 2 is called Fuchsian if it keeps invariant a disc in Riemann sphere. It is very natural to generalize this result and there are two ways to generalize it, which are either Γ is a subgroup of (n,1), where [formula] or Γ is a subgroup of (n,1). In latter case, J. Kim proved in the case of (2,1) in [\cite=Kim].

In this paper, we consider the same problem in the case that Γ is a subgroup of (3,1). Our main theorem is the following.

Let [formula] be a non-elementary complex hyperbolic Kleinian group. Then [formula] for all γ∈Γ if and only if Γ is conjugate to a subgroup of [formula] or [formula].

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In §2, we give some necessary preliminaries on complex hyperbolic spaces and in §3, we prove the main theorem.

Preliminaries

Complex hyperbolic space

Let [formula] be a (n + 1)-complex vector space with a Hermitian form of signature (n,1). An element of [formula] is a column vector [formula]. Throughout this paper, we choose the second Hermitian form on [formula] given by the matrix J

[formula]

Thus [formula], where [formula].

Recall that the Heisenberg group is [formula] with the group law

[formula]

where 〈〈 , 〉〉 is the standard Hemitian product on [formula]. One model of a complex hyperbolic space [formula], which matches the second Hermitian form is the Siegel domain [formula], which is parametrized in horospherical coordinates by [formula],

[formula]

where ∞   is a distinguished point at infinity. The boundary of [formula] is given by [formula]. Furthermore ψ maps [formula] homeomorphically to the set of points w in [formula] with 〈w,w〉 < 0 and maps [formula] homeomorphically to the set of points w in [formula] with 〈w,w〉 = 0. There is a metric on [formula] called the Bergman metric and the holomorphic isometry group of [formula] with respect to this metric is (n,1). The elements of (n,1) are classified by their fixed points. An element A∈(n,1) is called loxodromic if it fixes exactly two points of [formula], parabolic if it fixes exactly one point of [formula], and called elliptic if it fixes at least one point of [formula].

Now let's consider (3,1). A general form of an element B∈(3,1) and its inverse are written as

[formula]

Then, from BB- 1 = B- 1B = I, we get the following identities.

[formula]

The following lemmas are needed for us.

Let B in [formula] be such that the trace of B is real. Then the characteristic polynomial of B is self-dual.

For two nonzero complex numbers a and b, if ab and [formula] are all real, then either a and b are real or a and b are purely imaginary.

Note that 0 is both a purely real and purely imaginary number.

Cartan angular invariant

The Cartan angular invariant is a well-known invariant in complex hyperbolic geometry, and here we give the definition and some properties which will be used in the proof of the main theorem. For more details, see [\cite=Go].

The Cartan angular invariant [formula] of a triple [formula] is defined to be

[formula]

where 1,2,3 are lifts of x1,x2,x3 respectively. Then [formula] is independent of the choice of the lifts and [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] is invariant under permutations of the points xi up to sign.

A triple [formula] lies in the boundary of a complex line if and only if [formula], and lies in the boundary of a Lagrangian plane if and only if [formula].

Proof of the main Theorem

The "if" part is clear because any element of (3,1) or (1,1)  ×  (2) has real trace, so we will prove the "only if" part.

It is well-known that a non-elementary Kleinian group contains infinitely many loxodromic elements(See [\cite=Ma] or [\cite=FLW]). Now let A be a loxodromic element fixing [formula] and ∞   where [formula] and ∞   denote the points of [formula] represented by (0,0,0,1) and (1,0,0,0) respectively. In terms of matrices, due to the Lemma [\ref=lem:2.1], we can write

[formula]

where u > 1. Up to conjugacy, we can assume that A∈Γ.

If [formula] is an arbitrary element of Γ, then a, t, and f + n are real.

Since the trace of every element in Γ is real, tr(B) and tr(AB) + tr(A- 1B) are real.

[formula]

Solving for (a + t) and (f + n), since [formula], we get that a + t and f + n are real. Now consider

[formula]

Since (f + n) is real, [formula].

Similarly, by considering

[formula]

we have [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

Since [formula], i(f - n) sin θ = :y3 is real, so [formula] is real and so a is real. Since a + t is real, t is also real.

Consider the matrices A,B1,B2 in [formula].

[formula]

where u > 1. Suppose that A,B1 and B2 are in Γ. Then b1e2 + c1l2,d1q2,r1h2 + s1p2,q1d2,e1b2 + l1c2 + h1r2 + p1s2,f1f2 + g1m2 + m1g2 + n1n2 are all real.

We already know that a1,a2,t1,t2,f1 + n1,f2 + n2 are real by Lemma [\ref=lem:3.1]. Since (1,1) entry of B1B2 and B1AB2 + B1A- 1B2 are real, a1a2 + b1e2 + c1l2 + d1q2 and [formula] are real, so (b1e2 + c1l2) + d1q2 and [formula] are real. Solving for d1q2 and (b1e2 + c1l2), we get d1q2 and (b1e2 + c1l2) are real.

In a similar way, considering (4,4) entry of the same elements of Γ, we get that q1d2 and (r1h2 + s1p2) are real. Also, considering the sum of (2,2) entry and (3,3) entry of the same elements of Γ, we see that e1b2 + l1c2 + h1r2 + p1s2,f1f2 + g1m2 + m1g2 + n1n2 are all real.

Let B1 and B2 be arbitrary elements of Γ as written in Lemma [\ref=lem:3.2].

Putting B1 = B2 in the lemma we see that b1e1 + c1l1,d1q1,r1h1 + s1p1 and f21 + n21 + 2m1g1 are all real.

Putting B2 = B- 11 in the lemma we see that [formula] and [formula] are all real.

Either d1 and q1 are both real or else they are purely imaginary.

Part (c) follows from (a), (b) and Lemma [\ref=lem:2.2]. By this corollary, we know that for any B∈Γ, either (1,4) entry and (4,1) entry of B are both real or else they are purely imaginary.

It is easy to check that [formula] and ∞   are the fixed points of A. Since a non-elementary complex hyperbolic Kleinian group contains infinitely many loxodromic elements with pairwise distinct axes, there exists a loxodromic element B0 of Γ such that the axes of A and B0 are different. Write

[formula]

Then we claim that d0q0  ≠  0. If d0 = 0, then we get h0 = p0 = 0 from the identity [formula]. This implies B0 fixes [formula]. Similarly if q0 = 0, it can be easily seen that B0 fixes ∞  . In other words, if d0q0 = 0, then B0 fixes either [formula] or ∞  . This means that A and B0 share one but both fixed points. However the subgroup generated by such A and B0 is not discrete, which contradicts that Γ is discrete. Therefore the claim holds. Now we will consider the following two cases separately.

Case I: d0 and q0 are purely imaginary. From the identity [formula], we have b0 = c0 = 0 because [formula]. Similarly, from identities [formula], [formula], and [formula], we get e0 = l0 = 0, r0 = s0 = 0 and h0 = p0 = 0, respectively. Hence

[formula]

where a0,t0 are real and d0,q0 are purely imaginary. Furthermore, since det B0 = (a0t0 - d0q0)(f0n0 - g0m0) = 1, we have f0n0 - g0m0 = 1 because [formula].

From [formula], we have

[formula]

where a0t0 - d0q0 = f0n0 - g0m0 = 1. This implies that [formula] and [formula]. Hence B0 is an element of (1,1)  ×  (2).

Now let [formula] be any other element of Γ. Then a and t are real. By Lemma [\ref=lem:3.2], dq0 is real and so d is purely imaginary because q0 is a non-zero purely imaginary number. From identities [formula] and [formula], we get b = c = p = h = 0. Similarly, since d0q is real and d0 is a non-zero purely imaginary number, we have that q is purely imaginary and using some identities, we get e = l = r = s = 0. Using the same arguments as above, we conclude that B is of the form

[formula]

where at - dq = fn - gm = 1. Thus we can conclude that Γ is a subgroup of (1,1)  ×  (2) defined by

[formula]

Case II: d0 and q0 are real. Let [formula] be any other element of Γ. Then, according to Lemma [\ref=lem:3.1], a and t are real. By Lemma [\ref=lem:3.2], dq0 and qd0 are real. Since d0 and q0 are non-zero real numbers, d and q are real. Hence we know that (1,1),(1,4),(4,1) and (4,4) entries of any element of Γ are real. Let B1 and B2 be elements of Γ as written in Lemma [\ref=lem:3.2]. Considering the (1,4) entry of B- 11B2, we have that 1d2  +  1h2  +  1p2  +  1t2 is real. Noting that [formula] and

[formula]

it follows that [formula] is real for all B1,B2∈Γ.

Let V be the [formula]-linear span of [formula]. Then it can be easily seen that V is totally real. Furthermore every element of Γ stabilizes V. Therefore Γ leaves a totally real subspace of [formula] invariant. This means that Γ is conjugate to a subgroup of [formula] or [formula]. Since [formula] is a subgroup of [formula], we finally conclude that Γ is conjugate to a subgroup of [formula].
