Insulators of ABC Solutions

Introduction

This note concerns integer solutions to the ternary linear equation

[formula]

We call such solutions primitive if gcd (A,B,C)  =  1 and non-cuspidal if the product ABC is non-zero. Let [formula] denote the set of all primitive and non-cuspidal integer solutions to ([\ref=abceqn]).

We measure the complexity of these solutions, among other ways, by the height H(A,B,C)  =   max {|A|,|B|,|C|}, and the smoothness S(A,B,C) defined as the largest prime divisor of ABC.

The Lagarias-Soundararajan XYZ Conjecture [\cite=MR2780626] concerns the simultaneous behavior of H(A,B,C) and S(A,B,C). As the name suggests, the XYZ Conjecture is related to the celebrated ABC Conjecture, known to have far-reaching consequences. The main theorem of this note is a consequence of the XYZ Conjecture which seems surprising and does not appear to follow easily from the ABC Conjecture.

Say that a non-zero integer is insulated if it is divisible by exactly the primes less than a given bound and define the insulator I(A,B,C) as the smallest positive integer I such that ABC  ·  I is insulated.

Semi-Heights on ABC Solutions

Define a semi-height on [formula] as a function [formula] for which the set [formula] is finite for all real numbers X  >  0. This section describes some semi-heights on [formula].

For non-zero integers n, define [formula] as the largest square-free divisor of n and P+(n) as the largest non-composite divisor of n.

Define the height by H(A,B,C)  =   max {|A|,|B|,|C|}, the conductor by [formula], and the smoothness by S(A,B,C)  =  P+(ABC). These are all semi-heights on [formula].

The functions H, N, and S are related by the inequality

[formula]

It follows that [formula] for all X  >  0 and it suffices to show that [formula] is finite for all X  >  0.

Given X  >  0, define Σ  =  Σ(X) as the finite set consisting of all primes less than X. If S(A,B,C)  <  X then the associated solution (x,y)  =  ( - A / C, - B / C) to the unit equation

[formula]

must satisfy [formula]. Since [formula] is a finitely generated subgroup of ×, it follows from [\cite=MR2216774] that (x,y)  =  ( - A / C, - B / C) belongs to a finite set U(X) which depends on X. Since two solutions [formula] satisfy ( - A / C, - B / C)  =  ( - A' / C', - B' / C') if and only if (A',B',C')  =  (uA,uB,uC) for some [formula], the finiteness of [formula] follows from that of U(X).

There are far reaching conjectures relating the above semi-heights. For example, the celebrated ABC Conjecture of Masser and Oesterlé relates H(A,B,C) and N(A,B,C).

For every ε  >  0, there are only finitely many [formula] that satisfy H(A,B,C)  >  N(A,B,C)1  +  ε.

The condition that ε  >  0 is necessary. To see this, note that for k  ≥  2 we have [formula] and

[formula]

Recently, Lagarias and Soundararajan formulated a conjecture relating H(A,B,C) and S(A,B,C).

For every ε  >  0, only finitely many [formula] satisfy

[formula]

For every ε  >  0, infinitely many [formula] satisfy

[formula]

The XYZ and ABC conjectures are related by [\cite=MR2780626] which asserts that the ABC conjecture implies a weaker version of Conjecture [\ref=xyzconj](a) where the exponent 2 / 3  +  ε is replaced by 1  +  ε. We state here a weak version of Conjecture [\ref=xyzconj](a) which we don't know to follow from Conjecture [\ref=abcconj] at the time of this writing.

For every δ  >  0 there are only finitely many solutions [formula] for which log H(A,B,C)  >  δ  S(A,B,C).

Conjecture [\ref=xyzconj](a) implies Conjecture [\ref=weak_xyz].

Let δ  >  0 be given and let X  =  δ- 6. Assume that Conjecture [\ref=weak_xyz] is false. Assuming [\ref=xyzconj](a) we can then find infinitely many [formula] such that

[formula]

If follows that S(A,B,C)  <  δ- 6  =  X for infinitely many [formula], a contradiction to Lemma [\ref=semi_heights].

Insulators

We say a non-zero integer n is insulated if every prime p  ≤  P+(n) divides n. For example, the primorials [formula] are insulated. Define the insulator of a non-zero integer n as the smallest positive integer I(n) such that n  ·  I(n) is insulated. For example, I(256256)  =  I(28  ·  7  ·  11  ·  13)  =  3  ·  5  =  15. Since

[formula]

the insulator I(n) measures the failure of [formula] to be a primorial.

Suppose that {nk}∞k  =  1 is a sequence of non-zero integers such that lim k  →    ∞P+(nk)  =    ∞   and I(nk) is bounded. Let α and β be real numbers such that 0  <  α  <   log 2 and β  >   log 4. The inequality

[formula]

holds for k sufficiently large.

Choose a real number ε  >  0 such that 0  <  α / (1 - ε)  <   log 2. By equation ([\ref=measure_fail]) we have

[formula]

Since I(nk) is bounded, it follows that

[formula]

for P+(nk) sufficiently large. This inequality can be written as

[formula]

in terms of the Chebyshev function [formula]. By applying [\cite=MR1342300] we obtain

[formula]

when P+(nk) is sufficiently large. Combining ([\ref=lograd_on_chebyshev]) and ([\ref=chebyshev_on_smoothness]) with the hypothesis that lim n  →    ∞P+(nk)  =    ∞  , we obtain the validity of ([\ref=lograd_on_smoothness]) for k sufficiently large.

Insulators of ABC Solutions

We now use the language of insulators to study solutions in [formula]. Define the insulator of a solution [formula] by I(A,B,C)  =  I(ABC).

The function [formula] defines a semi-height on [formula].

Conjecture [\ref=weak_xyz] implies Conjecture [\ref=insulator_conjecture].

We prove the contrapositive. Let {(Ak,Bk,Ck)}∞k  =  1 be an infinite sequence of distinct elements of

[formula]

for some real number X. Let {nk}∞k  =  1 be given by nk  =  AkBkCk.

We show that {nk}∞k  =  1 satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma [\ref=sandwich]. Indeed, I(nk)  =  I(Ak,Bk,Ck)  <  X for all k since [formula]. Also, lim k  →    ∞P+(nk)  =    ∞   since P+(nk)  =  S(Ak,Bk,Ck) and [formula] is a semi-height on [formula] by Lemma [\ref=semi_heights]. For any constant α with 0  <  α  <   log 2, Lemma [\ref=sandwich] implies

[formula]

for k sufficiently large.

To obtain a contradiction to Conjecture [\ref=weak_xyz], we proceed by observing

[formula]

Combining inequalities ([\ref=apply_lemma]) and ([\ref=height_rad]) and letting δ  =  α  /  3 we have

[formula]

for k sufficiently large. Since P+(nk)  =  S(Ak,Bk,Ck), this implies

[formula]

for all sufficiently large k. This contradicts Conjecture [\ref=weak_xyz].

We now prove the main theorem.

Assume the strong form of the XYZ Conjecture holds. Then Proposition [\ref=prop1] and Theorem [\ref=thm1] imply that [formula] is a semi-height. It follows that all solutions [formula] with a particular insulator I0 are contained in the finite set [formula].
