The unitary gauge is an attractive gauge for the massive gauge theories for the absence of unphysical degrees of freedom and for the simplicity of the Feynman rules. Even though the on-shell S-matrix elements are known to be calculable in the unitary gauge [\cite=Dublin], it has not become a popular choice for practical loop calculations, mainly due to the lack of off-shell renormalizability. In the unitary gauge the loop calculations of the off-shell Green functions give rise to extra ultraviolet (UV) divergences that cannot be removed by the usual renormalization of coupling constants and wave functions. The main purpose of the present paper is to show that the off-shell Green functions are in fact renormalizable if we do not consider them in momentum space, but if we consider them in coordinate space for all distinct points. We draw this conclusion from an explicit relation between the unitary and covariant gauges for the Green functions. As a consequence of this relation, we can understand the structure of the extra divergences. In this paper we restrict ourselves only to the simplest case of QED with an explicit photon mass. Our analysis is based upon the earlier results on the gauge dependence of QED in the covariant gauge [\cite=Old] [\cite=S].

The massive QED is defined by the following gauge invariant lagrangian:

[formula]

where φ is a real scalar field called the Stückelberg field. In the covariant gauge we add a gauge fixing term to obtain the lagrangian

[formula]

We first wish to consider the relation between the covariant gauge and the unitary gauge. Using the following gauge invariant variables:

[formula]

we can rewrite the lagrangian ([\ref=Lxi]) as

[formula]

where LU is the lagrangian in the unitary gauge:

[formula]

Since [formula] is independent of φ, we can first integrate out φ in the lagrangian ([\ref=Lxi2]) if we are only interested in the Green functions of the gauge invariant fields which depend only on [formula]. Hence, we obtain

[formula]

This has the obvious meaning that the Green functions of gauge invariant fields are independent of ξ. We also note that the contribution of φ is a calculable overall factor on the left-hand side, since the Stückelberg field φ is free. Hence, Eq. ([\ref=xi-ind]) gives the explicit ξ dependence of the Green functions in the covariant gauge [\cite=Old] [\cite=S].

We have so far dealt with bare fields. We next wish to consider the renormalization of the off-shell Green functions in the unitary gauge. We use the dimensional regularization with [formula] dimensional euclidean space. By renormalizing the fields in the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme, the lagrangian in the covariant gauge is given by

[formula]

Both Z3 and ZM are independent of ξ, but Z2 depends on ξ as follows [\cite=Gauge]:

[formula]

Formally the unitary gauge is obtained by taking the limit ξ  →    ∞   in the lagrangian ([\ref=Lxiren]), but the limit ξ  →    ∞   does not commute with minimal subtraction because of the additional divergences generated in the limit ξ  →    ∞  . (For example, the wave function renormalization constant Z2(ξ) diverges as ξ  →    ∞   despite the use of dimensional regularization.) Hence, we must first choose the unitary gauge, and then renormalize the fields in the MS scheme to obtain results free of UV divergences.

By the same change of variables as Eq. ([\ref=change]), we obtain

[formula]

Especially for the electron propagator, we obtain

[formula]

Since

[formula]

where μ is a renormalization mass scale, we must renormalize the electron propagator further by the factor

[formula]

to remove UV divergences entirely. The ξ dependence ([\ref=Z2xidep]) of the wave function renormalization constant implies that in the unitary gauge the wave function renormalization constant 2 is the same as the one in the Landau gauge:

[formula]

As a consequence, the electron field in the unitary gauge has the same anomalous dimension as the electron field in the Landau gauge. (It vanishes at one-loop.) Thus, in terms of renormalized fields, the lagrangian for the unitary gauge is given by

[formula]

From Eqs. ([\ref=prop]-[\ref=wave]) the renormalized electron propagator in the unitary gauge and that in the covariant gauge are related by

[formula]

where [formula] (γ is the Euler constant), and

[formula]

In general, from Eq. ([\ref=relation]) we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] denotes normal ordering. This gives an explicit relation between the unitary and covariant gauges for the off-shell Green functions in coordinate space.

Note that even in the unitary gauge the Green functions in coordinate space are free of UV divergences by multiplicative renormalization of the electron fields. However, the propagator of the free massive scalar field φ has the following short-distance singularity

[formula]

and the exponentiated two-point function [formula] gives a singularity of order [formula] at order e2n in perturbation theory. For n  ≥  2 the singularity of order [formula] cannot be integrated over x = 0, and this unintegrability gives rise to extra UV divergences in the Fourier transforms of the Green functions. Despite the elementary appearance of the electron field in the unitary gauge, it behaves much as a composite field (of an arbitrarily high scale dimension) with respect to renormalization.

To clarify the structure of the extra UV divergences in the unitary gauge, let us study the short-distance singularity between two electron fields in the covariant gauge. Up to first order in e, we obtain

[formula]

This implies that [formula] contains the following unintegrable singularity up to order e3 in perturbation theory:

[formula]

Thus, we expect that the following UV singularities result even after multiplicative renormalization of fields if we consider the Fourier transforms of the Green functions:

[formula]

These results have been checked explicitly by one-loop calculations in the unitary gauge. Analogously, at order e4 the short-distance singularity

[formula]

gives rise to a pole at ε  =  0 in the Fourier transforms of Green functions involving two ψ fields. The product of three or more electron fields also generates unintegrable singularities. The structure of the extra singularities is the same as in the Green functions of composite fields in the covariant gauge.

Now that we understand the origin and structure of the extra UV divergences in the unitary gauge, we can easily conclude that they are harmless. Clearly the extra divergences do not affect the S-matrix, since the wave packets for the asymptotic particle states have no overlap in space, and the extra divergences that occur only if two or more fields coincide in space are irrelevant. Thus, the UV finiteness of the Green functions for distinct space coordinates guarantee the UV finiteness of the S-matrix.

Not everything we have found for the massive QED in the unitary gauge generalizes to the abelian and non-abelian Higgs theories in the unitary gauge. The free Stückelberg field φ is replaced by an interacting phase of the Higgs field in the latter theories, and the simple formula such as ([\ref=Uxi]) has no counterpart.

What generalizes is the qualitative feature of the renormalization properties. We expect that the unitary gauge is renormalizable in coordinate space, and the extra UV divergences of the Green functions in the momentum space are due to two or more fields coincident in space.

The massive QED that we have studied in this paper is a very simple theory treated in the covariant gauge, thanks to the decoupling of the Stückelberg field φ. The unitary gauge does not bring any simplification either to the number of degrees of freedom or to the Feynman rules. On the contrary, vast simplification is expected of the unitary gauge for both the abelian and non-abelian Higgs theories, for which the scalar and Faddeev-Popov ghosts are highly interacting in the covariant (or Rξ) gauge.

The extra UV divergences in the unitary gauge are absent in the S-matrix elements [\cite=Dublin], and in principle one can perform perturbative loop calculations without worrying about the divergences that appear before taking the mass-shell limit. For this procedure to gain popular acceptance, however, good understanding of the origin and structure of UV divergences is necessary for both abelian and non-abelian Higgs theories.
