Bell numbers, log-concavity, and log-convexity

The main theorems

For an integer k  ≥  2, let exp k(x) denote the k-times iterated exponential function

[formula]

Let {Bk(n)}∞n = 0 be the sequence of numbers given in the power series of exp k(x)

[formula]

The Bell numbers {bk(n)}∞n = 0   of order k   are defined by

[formula]

The numbers b2(n),n  ≥  0, with k = 2 are usually known as the Bell numbers. The first few terms of these numbers are 1,1,2,5,15,52,203. Note that exp 2(0) = e and so we have

[formula]

A sequence {δ(n)}∞n = 0 of nonnegative real numbers is called log-concave if

[formula]

It is called log-convex if

[formula]

The main purpose of this paper is to prove the following theorems.

Let {bk(n)}∞n = 0 be the Bell numbers of order k. Then the sequence {bk(n) / n!}∞n = 0 is log-concave and the sequence {bk(n)}∞n = 0 is log-convex.

Note that the conclusion of this theorem is equivalent the inequalities

[formula]

A different proof of the log-convexity of {b2(n)}∞n = 0 has been given earlier by Engel [\cite=engel]. In [\cite=can] Canfield showed that the log-concavity of {b2(n) / n!}∞n = 0 holds asymptotically. In a recent paper [\cite=cks], Cochran et al. used the log-concavity of certain sequences to study characterization theorems. However, they did not show whether the sequence {bk(n) / n!}∞n = 0 is log-concave. Thus our Theorem [\ref=thm:1] fills up this gap (for details, see Section [\ref=sec:3].)

Let {α(n)}∞n = 0 be a sequence of positive numbers with α(0) = 1.

(a) If {α(n)}∞n = 0 is log-convex, then

[formula]

(b) If {α(n) / n!}∞n = 0 is log-concave, then

[formula]

We will prove Theorems [\ref=thm:1] and [\ref=thm:2] in Section [\ref=sec:2]. The next theorem is an immediate consequence of these two theorems.

The Bell numbers {bk(n)}∞n = 0 of order k satisfy the inequalities

[formula]

In a recent paper [\cite=kks] it is shown that for any k  ≥  2 there exist constants c2 and c3, depending on k, such that for all n,m  ≥  0,

[formula]

Observe that from Eq. ([\ref=eq:n-2]) we get bk(n)bk(m)  ≤  bk(n + m)  ≤  2n + mbk(n)bk(m). Thus in fact we can take c2 = 2 and c3 = 1 for the Bell numbers of any order k.

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=thm:1] and [\ref=thm:2]

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:1] we prepare two lemmas and state the Bender-Canfield theorem [\cite=bc].

If {β(n) / n!}∞n = 0 is a log-concave sequence and r is a nonnegative real number such that β(2)  ≤  rβ(1)2, then the sequence [formula] is log-concave.

The sequence {b2(n) / n!}∞n = 0 is log-concave and the sequence {b2(n)}∞n = 0 is log-convex.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:1]

We prove the theorem by mathematical induction. By Lemma [\ref=lem:2] the theorem is true for k = 2. Assume the theorem is true for k. Note that [formula]. Hence

[formula]

But [formula]. Thus we get

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then the above equation becomes

[formula]

By the induction assumption, the sequence {bk(n) / n!}∞n = 0 is log-concave. This implies in particular that bk(0)bk(2) / 2  ≤  bk(1)2. But bk(0) = 1 and exp k(0) > 2. Hence

[formula]

Thus we can apply Lemma [\ref=lem:1] with β(n) = bk(n) and r =  exp k(0) to conclude that the sequence

[formula]

is log-concave. Note that for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

Hence the sequence [formula] is log-concave. Upon applying the Bender-Canfield theorem, we see from Eq. ([\ref=eq:2-1]) that the sequence {bk + 1(n) / n!}∞n = 0 is log-concave and the sequence {bk + 1(n)}∞n = 0 is log-convex.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:2]

To prove (a), let {α(n)}∞n = 0 be log-convex. Then α(n)α(n + 2)  ≥  α(n + 1)2. Hence α(n + 1) / α(n)  ≤  α(n + 2) / α(n + 1) and this implies that for any n  ≥  0 and m  ≥  1,

[formula]

Therefore, for any n  ≥  0 and m  ≥  1,

[formula]

After the cancellation we get α(n)α(m)  ≤  α(0)α(n + m). But α(0) = 1 and so Eq. ([\ref=eq:n-7]) is true when n  ≥  0 and m  ≥  1. When m = 0, Eq. ([\ref=eq:n-7]) obviously holds for any n  ≥  0. Hence we have proved assertion (a).

For the proof of (b), first note that {α(n) / n!}∞n = 0 is log-concave if and only if for all n  ≥  0,

[formula]

By using this inequality repeatedly, we get the following inequalities for any n  ≥  0 and m  ≥  1,

[formula]

Hence for any 0  ≤  j  ≤  m - 1,

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

After the cancellation we get

[formula]

But α(0) = 1. Hence we have proved that for any n  ≥  0,m  ≥  1,

[formula]

Note that when m = 0, Eq. ([\ref=eq:n-8]) obviously holds for any n  ≥  0. Thus assertion (b) is proved.

Application to white noise analysis

[formula] Characterization of test and generalized functions

The Bell numbers {bk(n)}∞n = 0 for k  ≥  2 provide important examples in white noise distribution theory [\cite=kuo96]. In a recent paper [\cite=cks] Cochran et al. have constructed a space α of test functions and its dual space *α of generalized functions from a nuclear space V and a sequence {α(n)}∞n = 0 of positive numbers satisfying the following conditions:

α(0) = 1.

inf n  ≥  0α(n) > 0.

[formula].

For the characterization of generalized functions in *α (Theorem 6.4 in [\cite=cks]) they assume the following condition

[formula]

where [formula] is the exponential generating function of the sequence {α(n)}∞n = 0. Furthermore, by Corollary 4.4 in [\cite=cks], if the sequence {α(n) / n!}∞n = 0 is log-concave, then the condition in Eq. ([\ref=eq:1-2]) is satisfied.

For the case α(n)  =  bk(n), Cochran et al. showed in Proposition 7.4 in [\cite=cks] that the condition in Eq. ([\ref=eq:1-2]) is satisfied. However, they did not show whether the sequence {bk(n) / n!}∞n = 0 is log-concave. Our Theorem [\ref=thm:1] shows that this is indeed the case.

The other conclusion in Theorem [\ref=thm:1], i.e., {bk(n)}∞n = 0 being log-convex, can be used to characterize the test functions. First we point out the following fact which can be easily checked.

Fact. If {β(n)}∞n = 0 is log-convex, then [formula] is log-concave.

Recall from Theorem [\ref=thm:1] that the sequence {bk(n)}∞n = 0 is log-convex. Hence by the above fact the sequence [formula] is log-concave.

In [\cite=cks] Cochran et al. did not study the characterization of test functions in α. In a recent paper [\cite=kubo] and our ongoing project initiated in [\cite=akk] several theorems on the characterization of test functions and related results have been obtained. For test functions, we need to assume the following condition

[formula]

where [formula] is the exponential generating function of the sequence [formula]. The same argument as in the proof of Corollary 4.4 in [\cite=cks] can be used to show that if [formula] is log-concave, then the condition in Eq. ([\ref=eq:3-1]) is satisfied.

In particular, when α(n)  =  bk(n), we know from Theorem [\ref=thm:1] that the sequence [formula] is log-concave. Thus the condition in Eq. ([\ref=eq:3-1]) is satisfied.

[formula] Inequality conditions on the sequence {α(n)}∞n = 0

In order to carry out the white noise distribution theory for the spaces α and *α the following three conditions have been imposed on {α(n)}∞n = 0 in [\cite=kks]:

There exists a constant c1 such that for any n  ≤  m,

[formula]

There exists a constant c2 such that for any n and m,

[formula]

There exists a constant c3 such that for any n and m,

[formula]

Note that ci  ≥  1 for all i = 1,2,3 since α(0) = 1. As shown in Section 3 in [\cite=kks], condition (c-3) implies condition (c-1). Moreover, it has been proved in Theorem 4.8 in [\cite=kks] that the Bell numbers {bk(n)}∞n = 0 satisfy conditions (c-1), (c-2), and (c-3). Below we give further comments on the constants c1,c2, and c3.

Obviously, if a sequence {α(n)}∞n = 0 is non-decreasing, then condition (c-1) is satisfied and c1 = 1 is the best constant satisfying condition (c-1).

From Eq. (7.5) in [\cite=cks] we have the formula for the sequence {Bk(n)}∞n = 0 defined in Eq. ([\ref=eq:n-9]) for k  ≥  2:

[formula]

where B1(n) = 1 for all n. On the other hand, we can differentiate both sides of Eq. ([\ref=eq:n-9]) and then compare the coefficients of xn to get the formula:

[formula]

We see from either Eq. ([\ref=eq:n-10]) or ([\ref=eq:n-11]) that the sequence {Bk(n)}∞n = 0 is increasing. But bk(n) = Bk(n) /  exp k(0) and so the sequence {bk(n)}∞n = 0 is also increasing. Hence the Bell numbers satisfy condition (c-1) and the best constant for c1 is c1 = 1.

As mentioned at the end of Section [\ref=sec:1], the Bell numbers of any order k  ≥  2 satisfy the inequalities:

[formula]

Hence the Bell numbers satisfy conditions (c-2) and (c-3) with c2 = 2 and c3 = 1. Obviously, c3 = 1 is the best constant for condition (c-3). As for the best constant for c2 we have the following

Conjecture. The best constant c2 in the condition (c-2) for the Bell numbers {bk(n)}∞n = 0 of any order k  ≥  2 is c2 = 2.

Here we prove that the conjecture is true for k = 2. It follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:3] that b2(n + m)  ≤  2n + mb2(n)b2(m). Hence the best constant c2 must be c2  ≤  2. On the other hand, by Theorem 4.3 in [\cite=kks],

[formula]

From this equality we obtain that

[formula]

Then we get the following limit

[formula]

Now, put m = n in condition (c-2) to get b2(2n)  ≤  c2n2b2(n)2. This inequality implies that for all n  ≥  1,

[formula]

Obviously, Eqs. ([\ref=eq:n-12]) and ([\ref=eq:n-13]) show that log 2  ≤   log c2. Hence c2  ≥  2. But we already noted above that c2  ≤  2. Therefore, c2 = 2.
