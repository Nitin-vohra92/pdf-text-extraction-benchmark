Introduction

Over recent years there has been considerable interest in gravity theories derived from lagrangians extended beyond the Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity. Originally this was motivated by the question what would happen if the fundamental action were different in an attempt to contrast the predictions of Einstein gravity with alternative theories[\cite=JORDAN59] [\cite=BRANSDICKE] [\cite=NORDVEDT70] [\cite=O'HANLON72]. More recently it has been realised that such extensions may be inescapable if we wish to ask the question what happens when quantum corrections become important as they must on scales close to the Planck length. Stelle[\cite=STELLE77] was the first to construct a renormalisable gravity action by including terms quadratic in the Riemmann curvature tensor. Such terms invariably appear as counter-terms in renormalisable theories[\cite=INDUCEDGRAVITY] involving scalar fields coupled to the curvature tensor, suggesting that the Einstein-Hilbert action itself is only the effective action induced by the vacuum, as originally proposed by Sakharov[\cite=SAKHAROV68]. Any lagrangian based on a finite number of terms involving the curvature tensor or its derivatives may be seen as a low-energy approximation to some fundamental action. One-loop contributions in string theory, for instance, give a lagrangian coupling the Ricci scalar to the dilaton field[\cite=ONELOOP].

Gravity theories where the contracted Ricci tensor appears coupled to a scalar field I will refer to as scalar-tensor gravity. Their study in a cosmological context has been pursued with particular vigour in recent years in the context of extended inflation[\cite=EXTINF]. Gravity lagrangians with terms of quadratic or higher order in the Ricci scalar have also been studied in cosmology[\cite=BARROWOTTEWIL] as these may be able to drive a period of inflation without the introduction of an extra inflaton field[\cite=MIJICETAL].

Teyssandier and Tourrenc[\cite=TEYTOU] pointed out that the field equations derived from a gravity lagrangian which is an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar are identical to those from a lagrangian involving an extra degree of freedom, a scalar field φ, which is then coupled to a linear function of the Ricci scalar, i. e. a scalar-tensor theory. In this letter I will show how this can be extended to write any gravitational lagrangian which is a function of the Ricci scalar, arbitrarily high derivatives [formula], and a set of non-minimally coupled scalar fields φi, as scalar-tensor gravity. This then allows one to write down the conformal transformation to the Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity with many scalar fields.

Fourth-order gravity as scalar-tensor gravity

The most commonly studied extended gravity action based solely on a function of the Ricci scalar is the quadratic action

[formula]

where M is a manifold of D-dimensions. (I follow the sign conventions of Wald[\cite=WALD84].) One might also include terms in RμνλκRμνλκ and RμνRμν. The first of these can always be eliminated as part of a total divergence while the second can only be rewritten in terms of R2 in homogeneous and isotropic metrics. It could be treated in a similar manner to the R2 term in what follows, but this would require the introduction of a tensor field φμν[\cite=KASPER93] and so cannot be described as scalar-tensor gravity. Considering the action quadratic only in the Ricci scalar, variation with respect to the metric gμν yields the Euler-Lagrange field equations

[formula]

Thus we find terms in the field equations which are second derivatives of the Ricci tensor and thus fourth derivatives of the metric.

However, Teyssandier and Tourrenc[\cite=TEYTOU] pointed out that the field equations are the same as would be derived if we considered an action linear with respect to the Ricci scalar including a new non-dynamical field φ.

[formula]

We now have equations of motion from varying the action with respect to the metric and the field φ.

[formula]

The last equation simply requires R = φ for [formula] (α = 0 corresponds to general relativity anyway) and substituting this into the metric field equation clearly gives the original field equations for the quadratic action, equation([\ref=QUADEOM]). The field equations only explicitly contain second derivatives of the metric, but do include second derivatives of the new field φ which is set equal to the Ricci scalar (containing second derivatives of the metric) by its equation of motion.

The action Sφ is clearly a scalar-tensor theory, albeit one without a kinetic term for the scalar field (equivalent to Brans-Dicke gravity[\cite=BRANSDICKE] with the Brans-Dicke parameter ω = 0) but with a potential term [formula]. This is identical to O'Hanlon's massive dilaton gravity[\cite=O'HANLON72]

[formula]

where [formula] and m2f(Φ) = αφ2 / GD = (GDΦ - 1)2 / (4αGD). O'Hanlon introduced his action to produce a "fifth force" Yukawa type interaction in the quasi-Newtonian gravitational potential, so it is not surprising that it also appears in the weak-field limit of fourth-order gravity[\cite=PECHLANERSEXL].

This equivalence applies to any gravitational lagrangian that is a function of the Ricci scalar.

[formula]

Where ' denotes differentiation with respect to φ. The field equation for φ again gives φ  =  R, provided [formula], which substituted into the metric field equations gives the standard field equations for the F(R) lagrangian.

In O'Hanlon's notation, we have

[formula]

Higher-order gravity as scalar-tensor gravity

We can extend this equivalence to sixth- or arbitrarily high-order gravity theories derived from lagrangians that are functions not only of R but also [formula] or [formula], where [formula] is the d'Alembertian. Such terms can also be generated by quantum corrections to general relativity and these theories have recently been studied in the context of inflationary cosmology[\cite=SCHMIDT90] [\cite=SIXTHORDER].

Notice that apparently different lagrangians [formula] can yield identical field equations if they differ only by a total divergence, as this can be written as a boundary term which cannot contribute to the Euler-Lagrange equations. For instance, [formula] alone is a total divergence and can be ignored, while a term [formula] can be integrated by parts to give [formula]. Thus I can take any polynomial function [formula] to be linear in its highest-order derivative ([formula]), and that this term is multiplied only by a function of the Ricci scalar, Fn(R). Its field equations contain (2n + 4)-order derivatives of the metric tensor. Any lagrangian containing a term [formula] multiplied by derivatives of the Ricci scalar, or any other fields, corresponds to a still-higher-order gravity theory as it can be integrated by parts to give terms at least of order [formula].

Consider then the action for (2n + 4)-order gravity, with a polynomial [formula]

[formula]

The classical field equations are[\cite=SCHMIDT90]

[formula]

where I have used

[formula]

We introduce the new variables φi  =  φ0,φ1,...φn and write the function [formula] as F(φi), selecting a new action whose field equations will require [formula], with [formula]. Thus we choose the dynamically equivalent action

[formula]

and the φk field equations are

[formula]

where

[formula]

Then this does indeed require [formula], subject now to the condition that the matrix Fjk is non-degenerate (i. e. [formula]), and it can be verified that the metric field equations are indeed the same as in the original higher-order gravity theory.

The lagrangian, which still contains derivatives of R, can be reduced to a lagrangian linear in the Ricci scalar by integration by parts. For instance

[formula]

Because I am only concerned in this section with actions yielding equivalent Euler-Lagrange field equations I will continue to disregard boundary terms. That is, I am assuming that to obtain the variation of the action to first-order, I can neglect the contribution due to the variation of the fields' derivatives on the boundary, ∂M. There is nothing lost by this, as the correct form of the boundary term required in higher-order gravity theories to avoid this requirement is not in general known[\cite=MADSENBARROW89]; a fact I will return to later.

Thus the action can be brought to

[formula]

Notice that the scalar functional, Φ, multiplying the Ricci scalar will contain derivatives of the scalar fields φi

[formula]

For this to correspond to the standard scalar-tensor lagrangian we must consider the functional Φ as a scalar field. (This is another subtle change in the underlying action, although again it will yield a dynamically equivalent theory as the classical field equations are not changed.) In practice it is easy to eliminate φn by rewriting it as a functional of Φ and the other fields φi  ≠  n, as it only appears linearly in the above expression for Φ in the j = 0 term.

[formula]

This method can be straightforwardly extended to higher-order gravity lagrangians that also contain scalar fields already coupled to the Ricci scalar or its derivatives. Thus (2n + 4)-order scalar-tensor gravity with m non-minimally coupled scalar fields can be written as a standard (second-order) scalar-tensor theory with m + n + 1 scalar fields.

Example 1: [formula]

This corresponds to sixth-order gravity[\cite=SIXTHORDER] and so I will show it to be dynamically equivalent to second-order gravity with two scalar fields. F(φi) = φ0(1 + γφ1) and so the equivalent action (in 4-dimensional spacetime) is

[formula]

The scalar multiplying the Ricci scalar is thus [formula]. The φi field equations are

[formula]

So the requirement that the matrix Fjk (equation [\ref=Fjk]) is non-degenerate is simply that [formula]. If we wish to treat Φ as a variable rather than φ1 the action can be rewritten, again neglecting boundary terms, as

[formula]

Notice now that the derivative terms now appear as a kinetic term for the field φ0 in the action rather than multiplying the Ricci scalar. To make this field appear as a canonical scalar field with the usual kinetic term in the matter lagrangian we can define

[formula]

Thus this sixth-order gravity theory can be seen to be dynamically equivalent to Brans-Dicke theory with ω = 0 (as there is no kinetic term for the Brans-Dicke field Φ) and an interaction potential

[formula]

coupling Φ to the scalar field σ.

Example 2: F(φ,R)  =  R + αR2 - 8πG(ξφ2R + gμνφ,μφ,ν)

The field equations from this lagrangian contain terms of fourth-order in the metric with a non-minimally coupled scalar field φ and has been considered in the context of inflationary cosmology by Maeda et al[\cite=MAEDAETAL89]. It can be rewritten by introducing the dynamically equivalent action whose field equations are second-order with respect to the metric with two scalar fields.

[formula]

This can be rewritten in terms of the single non-minimally coupled Brans-Dicke field, Φ, with no kinetic term if we define

[formula]

and substitute for φ in terms of this field:

[formula]

Conformal equivalence

I have shown the dynamical equivalence of between the field equations derived from arbitrarily high-order gravity lagrangians and scalar-tensor theories. This should not be very surprising to those who know that both theories are conformally related to general relativity plus scalar fields[\cite=MAEDA89]. Having conformally transformed from the fourth-order field equations, for instance, to an Einstein metric, one introduces a scalar field, ψ, which could be interpreted as the conformal transform of a Brans-Dicke field [formula] (with ω = 0 and a self-interaction) and so transform back to the scalar-tensor field equations.

It is important to stress however that the conformal equivalence between scalar-tensor gravity and general relativity with a scalar field, in contrast to my discussion of the relation between scalar-tensor and higher-order gravity, is not just a dynamical equivalence. The gravitational action is conformally equivalent, not just the solutions to the classical equations of motion.

If we write the action in scalar-tensor form, i. e. in terms of what I will call the Jordan metric, gμν,

[formula]

I have included here a boundary term which is necessary, just as it is in general relativity[\cite=GRBOUNDARY], if we are to derive the field equations from the requirement that the action is stationary with respect to first-order variations of the fields subject only to the constraint that the variations vanish on the boundary, ∂M, of the manifold. hμν is the metric on this (D - 1)-dimensional surface and K its extrinsic curvature. The field equations derived are then the usual equations of motion for scalar-tensor gravity.

One can always write the field equations and the action in terms of a conformally rescaled metric

[formula]

where the conformal factor Ω2 = (GDΦ)2 / (D - 2). This is just a change of variables which is always possible for Φ > 0, equivalent to demanding that the gravitational coupling be positive definite which may well be required anyway. Written in terms of this new metric the action becomes

[formula]

where I have been careful not to discard any boundary terms. This is the full general relativistic action, plus a scalar field ψ defined by

[formula]

whose potential is

[formula]

The difference between the two frames is in the form of the matter lagrangian. If some fluid is defined in the Jordan metric, then in the Einstein frame the factor Ω- D = (GDΦ)- D / (D - 2) in the matter lagrangian introduces an interaction between this fluid and the scalar field ψ. It is the nature of the matter lagrangian which may be used to specify the "physical" metric[\cite=BRANS88].

For higher-order gravity theories the conformal transform is not so straightforward. In the case of F(R) lagrangians, for instance, the conformal factor is Ω2 = (dF / dR)2 / (D - 2)[\cite=MAEDA89] [\cite=BARROWCOTSAKIS88] and the scalar field that appears in the Einstein frame is

[formula]

This is a new variable in the Einstein frame but does not appear to correspond to any extra degree of freedom in the higher-order theory, but rather a function of the Ricci scalar for the metric. In fact the Einstein frame described as the conformal transform of higher-order gravity theories is actually the conformal transformation of the dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor theory described earlier. The new degree of freedom ψ is just the variable φ, which along classical trajectories obeys φ  =  R.

I have shown that the more general case of arbitrarily high-order gravity based on lagrangians that are functions of [formula], are also dynamically equivalent to scalar-tensor gravity and again it is this lagrangian, given in terms of the scalar fields Φ and φi, for i = 0,1,...(n - 1), that is conformally equivalent to general relativity plus n + 1 scalar fields. The original higher-order gravity theory is only equivalent to the conformally related Einstein theory at the level of the classical field equations, while the Einstein action is actually equal to that in the scalar-tensor theory, not only along the classical trajectories.

In this case the conformal factor[\cite=SCHMIDT90]

[formula]

In general we can only define one scalar field in the Einstein frame which has a standard kinetic term:

[formula]

The remaining scalar degrees of freedom in the Einstein frame have non-standard kinetic terms and may also be coupled via the potential

[formula]

Example 1: [formula]

The dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor theory to this sixth-order gravity lagrangian was shown earlier to have the full action

[formula]

with the two scalar fields obeying [formula] and [formula] along classical solutions. Rewritten in terms of the conformally rescaled Einstein metric, μν = (GΦ)gμν, this becomes the Einstein-Hilbert action (equation [\ref=E-H]) with the new matter lagrangian

[formula]

where [formula] and the potential

[formula]

Example 2: F(φ,R)  =  R + αR2 - 8πG(ξφ2R + gμνφ,μφ,ν)

The dynamically equivalent Brans-Dicke action in 4-dimensions was given earlier in equation [\ref=EX2ACTION], where the Brans-Dicke field is required by the field equations to be GΦ  =  1  -  8πGξφ2 + 2αR. This can then be conformally transformed to the general relativistic gravity lagrangian using the rescaled Einstein metric, μν  =  (GΦ)gμν, with the corresponding matter lagrangian containing the two scalar fields φ and [formula].

Summary

I have expanded on the observation by Teyssandier and Tourrenc that the classical field equations of fourth-order gravity theories may be derived from an equivalent scalar-tensor lagrangian to show that this extends to arbitrarily high-order theories. Specifically, I have shown that the field equations of (4 + 2k)th-order gravity can be derived from a lagrangian where the Ricci scalar is coupled to a Brans-Dicke field with ω = 0, but coupled through an interaction potential to a further k scalar fields.

Such scalar-tensor actions can be written in standard Einstein form by a conformal re-scaling of the metric. The gravitational actions written in either frame are exactly equivalent, even including the correct boundary terms. (The physical difference between the two metrics lies in the matter lagrangian). By contrast there is no such conformal transformation of the original higher-order gravity action. One consequence is that there is no way to write down the correct boundary term for the higher-order theory[\cite=MADSENBARROW89] by conformally transforming the corresponding term in general relativity as one can do in scalar-tensor gravity.

The field equations derived from higher-order lagrangians can be conformally transformed to an Einstein frame with many scalar fields because of the equivalence at the level of the classical field equations between these theories and scalar-tensor gravity. I have referred to this as dynamical equivalence. It is certainly sufficient to determine the classical behaviour while the conformal factor is well-behaved, but it may not be valid when considering "off-shell" or quantum effects where the field configurations do not follow the classical trajectories. In particular, while calculations of quantum fluctuations during an inflationary epoch may safely be done in the conformal Einstein frame of a scalar-tensor theory[\cite=KST90] one should beware of doing such calculations in the conformal frame of higher-order gravity theories, where one is no longer free to vary the scalar field ψ independently of the metric.

It is instructive to note that some higher-order gravity theories cannot be conformally transformed to an Einstein gravity with scalar fields, and these correspond to those for which the dynamical equivalence with a scalar-tensor theory breaks down. For instance the gravitational action

[formula]

can be transformed to a scalar-tensor model with [formula], where φ0 = R and [formula] along classical trajectories, so long as the determinant of the matrix Fjk (equation [\ref=Fjk]) is non-zero. This requires ∂F1  /  ∂φ0  ≠  0. Amendola[\cite=AMENDOLA93] recently considered a gravitational lagrangian with a non-minimally derivative coupled scalar field which differs only by a total divergence from the above action with F1 = F1(φ). Amendola was unable to find a conformal Einstein frame because in this case the matrix Fjk is degenerate.
