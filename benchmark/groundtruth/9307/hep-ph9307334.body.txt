Abstract

We compute a unitarity bound for higgs mass using one-loop corrected s-wave partial amplitude for ZLZL  →  ZLZL scattering. We use the equivalence theorem and show that the higgs mass has to be less than ≈  600 GeV in order to save the (perturbative) unitarity in the higgs' resonance region. We also discuss about the validity of perturbation expansion in the symmetry breaking sector.

The Higgs sector of the Standard Model is, unlike the other parts of it, still poorly understood. The minimal version of the Standard Model has one SU(2) Higgs doublet consisting of four real degrees of freedom. As a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking three of them become longitudinal components W±L and ZL of the massive weak gauge bosons W± and Z, whereas one degree of freedom remains as a physical particle H. The vacuum expectation value of this particle is experimentally fixed, although the particle itself has not been observed: the mass of the Higgs boson mH, or equivalently, the value of the self-interaction coupling constant λ of the symmetry breaking sector is unknown.

By direct searches, the lower limit of the higgs mass has been able to push as high as mH > 60 GeV [\cite=lep]. The combined fit of LEP data and low energy experiments favor the higgs mass not to be more than a couple of hundred GeV's [\cite=fit] (assuming only the minimal Standard Model) but the upper limit is not very conclusive. If mH is large enough, perturbative calculations are not reliable any more because the symmetry breaking sector becomes strongly interacting. The scattering amplitudes of the would-be Goldstone bosons are related to the scattering amplitudes of the longitudinal weak gauge bosons ZL and W±L according to so called equivalence theorem [\cite=CG] [\cite=lqt]. It states that the scattering amplitudes of the longitudinal gauge bosons are, in leading order of mW / E, where E is the energy scale of the scattering, the same as for the corresponding would-be Goldstone boson scattering amplitudes calculated in the Rξ-gauge.

Our aim is therefore to study, how large mH may be in order to consider perturbative calculations reliable. An upper bound for the higgs mass can be estimated by considering the limitations which the requirement of (perturbative) unitarity of the scattering matrix puts on its elements, in particular for the partial wave amplitudes. This approach was first introduced by Lee, Quigg and Thacker [\cite=lqt] who found, using the tree level expression for the s-wave partial amplitude azz  →  zz0(s) and a rough unitarity bound |azz  →  zz0(s)| < 1, that mH should be less than 1 TeV in order to save the tree level unitarity in the limit s  →    ∞  . Later the high energy unitarity bound was sharpened by Durand, Johnson and Lopez [\cite=djl] (see also [\cite=others]) by including O(g2m2H / m2W) one-loop corrections and using the more restrictive unitarity condition

[formula]

Their result was that mH should be less than ≃400 GeV in order to save the unitarity.

Our approach is to test the bound ([\ref=ub]) near the resonance s / m2H = 1. A good feature of this approach is that unlike the bound in [\cite=djl], the bound we obtain to the higgs mass is independent of the effective energy scale up to which the Standard Model is considered to be a valid theory. It turns out that this approach gives the unitarity bound for the higgs mass which is of the same order of magnitude as the earlier bounds. Our aim is also to discuss, what is consistent way to perform the perturbative expansion of the physical quantities when the perturbation parameter g2m2H / (16π2m2W) is rather large.

We calculate the neutral Goldstone boson zz  →  zz scattering amplitude at one-loop level and interpret the result as a large mH approximation for the ZLZL  →  ZLZL amplitude according to the equivalence theorem. In ZLZL  →  ZLZL scattering s, t and u channels are all open while in e.g.  w+w-  →  w+w- scattering only s and t channels are open leading to a less stringent unitarity bound, in general [\cite=lqt] [\cite=djl]. The interaction Lagrangian reads

[formula]

where subscript 0 refers to bare quantities. The quantity δT = λ0v0(v20  -  μ20  /  λ0), which vanishes at tree level, cancels the tadpole term generated in the loop expansion. It can be shown that δT is related to the Goldstone boson self-energy at zero momentum transfer Π(0) by [\cite=taylor] δT =  - v0Π(0). Therefore, our computational strategy is parallel to [\cite=djl] [\cite=mw]: we ignore all tadpole terms and subtract the zero momentum Goldstone boson self-energy from all scalar self-energies, which guarantees that the Goldstone bosons remain massless in the presence of loop corrections, too. Furthermore, it is convenient to perform all calculations in the Landau gauge where bare w± and z propagators have zero mass.

Our renormalization description is as follows: mH is taken to be the physical higgs mass determined by the pole of the full propagator (Im  Π  ≪  m2H)

[formula]

and the coupling constant is renormalized by defining

[formula]

which is formally similar to the tree level relation. The parameters g and mW are renormalized so that only corrections proportional to m2H / m2W are taken into account in the counterterms δg and δm2W. As a consequence of this choice one obtains δg = 0 and [\cite=marsir]

[formula]

Furthermore, we have to specify a wave function renormalization for the Goldstone bosons. We choose Zz to be defined as the residue of the z-propagator at its pole s = 0, whence a calculation results

[formula]

Near the resonance s / m2H = 1 the amplitude changes very rapidly so, that it is important to perform a full one loop calculation, in particular to include various imaginary parts coming from three and four point vertex functions. The complete one-loop s-wave partial amplitude reads

[formula]

where G is the full, renormalized higgs propagator

[formula]

and Γ3 and Γ4 are the proper three and four point vertex functions, respectively. The scattering angle θ is related to the Mandelstam variables through the usual relations. Introducing dimensionless integration and dynamical variables w =  - t / m2H and x = s / m2H the partial wave amplitude azz  →  zz0 reads

[formula]

To study the effects of the loop corrections we define the dimensionless functions f2, f3 and f4 by

[formula]

where αH is the expansion parameter

[formula]

Note, that into the parameter x0 = 1 - αH3πi / 8 are, actually, all O(αH) corrections to the pole of the propagator G included, because the function f2 has the property f2(1) = 0.

Our results are summarized in Figure 1. In the low energy region, 0 < x < 0.5 where no resummation was made for the s channel propagator G(x), the partial wave amplitude reads in first order in αH

[formula]

Although both functions f3 and f4 can be in general evaluated only numerically, their asymptotic behaviour when their arguments approach zero is rather easy to obtain. One can check that logarithmic and constant terms cancel each other in accordance with the low energy theorem [\cite=lowthe]. In the low energy regime, however, we can not interpret the Goldstone boson amplitudes as scattering amplitudes of the longitudinal gauge bosons because the condition [formula] of the equivalence theorem is not fulfilled.

In the resonance region, 0.5 < x < 2, the curve with dashed line in Fig. 1 corresponds to azz  →  zz0(x) evaluated in terms of a pole x'0, a residue Z and a remnant part R(x):

[formula]

This form is adequate for the perturbation theory near a resonance where usual perturbation expansion would lead to a divergence. Therefore, to remove this singular behaviour, the leading αH correction of the pole of the propagator has to been taken into account. The real part of the self energy contributes, however, only to the O(α2H) correction whereas the correction to the imaginary part is O(αH). Thus in Eq. ([\ref=laurent]), the terms Z, x0 and R(x) are evaluated in first order in αH, whence x'0  =  x0. The curve with solid line in Figure 1 corresponds to azz  →  zz0 with proper s-channel higgs propagator:

[formula]

The t and u channel propagators need not to be resummed, because they are analytical in the - w < 0 region. In practise, the difference between these two forms is small in the resonance region, even when the parameter αH is as large as αH = 0.42  ·  (0.6)2 = 0.15. When x  ≫  1, situation is completely different because of the logarithmic terms of the function f2. For large x they are important, which is analogous to the concept of effective coupling constant which should be used as a perturbation parameter. One expects that in high energy region one should use Eq. ([\ref=a0zfull]) instead of Eq. ([\ref=laurent]).

Directly from the Fig. 1 we obtain the unitarity bound mH  <   400 - 600 GeV, though the unitarity is violated very softly. One also concludes from Fig. 1 that the point xc = sc / m2H where the s-wave amplitude leaves the unitarity circle is a decreasing function of the higgs mass. For mH = 400 GeV xc = 1.7, while for mH = 600 GeV xc = 1.4. In the case of high energy unitarity limit one would interpret [formula] to be the effective scale up to which the Standard Model is valid effective theory and above which new physics is expected to show up to save the perturbative unitarity. However, if the unitarity limit is near the higgs' resonance, [formula], this interpretation is not possible [\cite=dasneu]. The breaking of the unitarity is a sign of strong interaction physics and one expects that if the breaking scale [formula] is not too far from mH, the Higgs scalar is not a propagating state by itself but form a bound state opening a new channel. It pulls the s-wave amplitude inside the unitarity circle.

One should notice, that [formula] -correction implied due the use of the equivalence theorem change the slope of the curves in Figures 1 by 20 % at most. One expects therefore that this correction does not chance much the point where the partial wave amplitude curve leaves the unitarity circle, if the curve crosses the circle perpendicularly enough. To be on the safe side, the unitarity bound near the higgs' resonance should be taken mH  ≤  600 GeV. Although the first order corrections lower the unitarity bound from that calculated in the tree approximation, the second order corrections are not expected to change first order results. When mH = 600 GeV, the perturbation parameter αH has the value αH = 0.15 which means that near the higgs' resonance they are comparable to the corrections implied by the equivalence theorem. Furthermore, inclusion of the fermions, the t-quark in practice, affects the unitarity bound near the resonance (mH  =  600 GeV) about 20 %, too. The decay width of the higgs, in other words the imaginary part of the pole parameter x0, is expected to be the most sensitive to mW / mH corrections implied by the equivalence theorem [\cite=mw] and top-quark effects. The inclusion of them results xc = 1.8 for mH = 400 GeV and xc = 1.5 for mH = 600 GeV. One expects that these corrections to the parameters Z and R(x) in addition to x0 tend to rise the value of sc slightly but the unitarity bound for the higgs mass remains essentially unchanged. Thus we may conclude that the higgs mass should not exceed 600 GeV in order to save perturbative calculations in the Higgs sector of the Standard Model.
