Abstract

Theoretically, the electric charge of the tau neutrino may be non-zero. The experimental bound on the electric charge of the tau neutrino is many orders of magnitude weaker than that for any other known neutrino. If the tau neutrino does have a small electric charge, and its mass is greater than 1 MeV, then it can annihilate sufficiently in the early Universe by electromagnetic interactions to avoid conflict with the standard cosmology model. A novel feature of this scenario is that there can be effectively less than three neutrino species present during nucleosynthesis.

The standard model contains 12 fermions - 6 quarks and 6 leptons. Theoretically, it is known that the electric charges of these fermions are heavily constrained by the classical structure of the standard model [\cite=cq] [\cite=rf]. In fact there are just four classically undetermined electric charges in the standard model. These four undetermined parameters can be taken to be the charges of the 3 neutrinos and the charge of the down quark ( we denote these four electric charges as Q(νe), Q(νμ), Q(ντ) and Q(d) ). All of the other fermion electric charges can be uniquely determined from the classical structure of the standard model in terms of these four classically undetermined parameters. Experimentally, it is known that

[formula]

where the experimental bounds on the δ parameters come from experiments on the neutron charge [\cite=bk], the neutrality of matter [\cite=mm], νμe scattering [\cite=bv] and the SLAC beam dump experiment [\cite=dcb].

In addition to carrying a little electric charge, neutrinos may also be massive. The experimental bounds on the masses of the neutrinos are given by [\cite=pdb]:

[formula]

In addition to these direct experimental constraints, there are also other constraints which can be obtained by demanding that the particle physics be consistent with the standard cosmology model. Although these "bounds" are not as dependable as the experimental bounds due to the nature of cosmology (e.g. it involves untested assumptions about the nature of the Universe a long time ago), they are nevertheless still of interest since the standard cosmology model is simple and quite successful [\cite=lv]. There are two important bounds from cosmology: (1) The predicted energy density of massive neutrinos can a priori violate the observed bound. (2) The number of light particles and their interactions can be constrained from nucleosynthesis. If the neutrinos are stable and do not annihilate sufficiently in the early Universe, then consistency with the standard cosmology model requires that they must have mass less than about 100 eV, which for the μ and τ neutrinos, is many orders of magnitude less than the experimental bounds. If the electric charges of the neutrinos are zero, then they can only annihilate via weak interactions. It has been shown some time ago [\cite=lswein] ( see also [\cite=others] ), that they only annihilate sufficiently ( by weak interactions ) if their mass is greater than about 2 GeV. Since we know from experiments that the known neutrinos all have mass less than 2 GeV, they will not annihilate sufficiently by weak interactions. However, if they have electric charge, then they can annihilate via the electromagnetic interactions. We will now consider the case of a charged tau neutrino ( since the experimental bound on its charge is by far the weakest out of the three known neutrinos ).

If the tau neutrino has a mass greater than about 1 MeV, then tau and anti-tau neutrinos can annhilate into electron and positron pairs via a s-channel photon. The cross section for this process is quadratic in the tau neutrino electric charge. For tau neutrino masses less than 1 MeV, the annihilation cross section is considerably smaller since the annihilation into electron positron pairs is kinematically forbidden. The leading order contribution to the cross section is the process νττ  →  γγ and the cross section is proportional to the fourth power of the tau neutrino charge. For this reason we will consider the region of parameter space mντ  >  2me  ~  1 MeV.

To calculate the relic number density of the heavy tau neutrinos we use the rate equation,

[formula]

where n is the actual number density of heavy neutrinos at time t, n0 is the equilibrium number density, R is the cosmic scale factor, 〈σ|v|〉 is the thermal average of the neutrino annihilation cross section times the relative speed. The three terms on the right-hand side of Eq. ([\ref=rate]) represent the change in n due to the expansion of the Universe, the annihilation and creation of the massive neutrinos respectively. At the temperatures under consideration, the Universe is radiation dominated so that R, T and t are related by

[formula]

where Mp is the Planck mass. The energy density ρ can be expressed in terms of the effective number of degrees of freedom Nf so that

[formula]

where we have chosen units of temperature such that the Boltzmann constant is equal to one. In our case [formula] (at temperatures less than mντ) corresponding to the photon, two light neutrinos and e± degrees of freedom. By using Eqs. ([\ref=rad]) and ([\ref=rho]), the rate equation of Eq. ([\ref=rate]) can be rewritten in the more convenient form,

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula] and [formula]. To get an approximate analytical solution to Eq. ([\ref=f]) we use the approximations made in Ref. [\cite=lswein]; i.e,

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the equilibrium distribution for nonrelativistic particles (with g  =  4 for Dirac fermions) and Tf is the freeze-out temperature. Solving Eqs. ([\ref=f2]) results in

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore the present day mass density of the relic massive tau neutrinos (including the anti-neutrinos) will be given by

[formula]

where T is evaluated at the present temperature of the relic photons, Tγ  =  2.75 K.

To get actual numerical estimates, we need to calculate the reaction rate 〈σ|v|〉. We find for the s-channel annihilation process,

[formula]

where [formula] ( for i  =  e,ν ) and α is the electromagnetic fine structure constant. In the non-relativistic limit Eq. ([\ref=cs]) reduces to:

[formula]

which is the expression that we will use to evaluate Eqs. ([\ref=xf]) and ([\ref=fx]). In doing so we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

where ρc  =  1.88  ×  10- 29h2 gcm- 3 is the critical density. For simplicity we will take the h parameter to be one. The requirement that [formula] gives a bound on the neutrino's charge and mass. The numerical solutions to the above equations are presented in Fig. 1. It is found that for [formula], [formula] and so the energy density bound can approximately be written as

[formula]

where 1  <  mν  ≤  35 MeV.

Therefore, if the tau neutrino has a mass greater than 1 MeV, then it can annihilate sufficiently in the early Universe provided it has a small electric charge. Thus, by endowing the tau neutrino with a small electric charge, the first major constraint for consistency with standard cosmology can be satisfied. Also note that the tau neutrino can close the Universe and is thus a potential dark matter candidate.

The second constraint from consistency with the standard cosmology model is that the energy density in the early Universe cannot be too large, otherwise too much helium will be produced. In our scenario, all of the charged tau neutrinos will continue to annihilate until the temperature drops below about 0.01 to 2.5 MeV (depending on the mass of the tau neutrino) so that during nucleosynthesis their numbers are heavily depleted relative to the number of relativistic species. Thus, our scenario has the novel feature that there can be effectively only 2 ( plus a fraction ) neutrinos ( depending on its mass and charge ) present during nucleosynthesis.

The bound on the effective number of neutrinos present during nucleosynthesis from standard cosmology depend on some assumptions. For example, the authors of Ref. [\cite=walk] and Ref. [\cite=sar] derive the bounds Nν  ≤  3.4 and Nν  <  5 respectively, while some other analyses suggest that Nν could be less than 3 [\cite=ri]. One of the points of this paper is that a cosmology bound of less than 3 neutrinos during nucleosynthesis is not in conflict with particle physics and may indicate the possibility of a charged tau neutrino. Also, note that there are many models with massive neutrinos (or with light exotic particles) which have effectively more than 3 neutrino species present during nucleosynthesis. So many of these models have some conflict with the standard cosmology model. However, if the tau neutrino is charged, as discussed above, many of these models can become consistent with standard cosmology.
