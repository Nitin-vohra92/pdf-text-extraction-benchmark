The recent paper "There Are Infinitely Many Prime Twins" by R.F. Arenstorf [\cite=Arenstorf] has raised a lot of excitement. The author claims to proved that:

[formula]

where the twin constant

[formula]

Waiting for the formal approval of this result by mathematical community I have run the computer program to check the validity of ([\ref=main]). Even Hardy and Littlewood in their famous paper [\cite=Hardy] have presented tables with numerical verification of their conjectures based on the existing that time data up to 9 000 000. Because the program I have written several years ago performs all operations on bits it was natural to store the data representing the actual arithmetical mean value of log (p) log (p + 2) at values of N forming the geometrical progression with the ratio 2, i.e. at [formula]. The results are presented in the Table 1.

TABLE I

As it can be seen from above table there is no apparent dependence on N. Indeed, trying to find heuristically the dependence on N we can argue that the probability to find twin pair around x is C2  /   log 2(x) and hence the mean expectation value of the product log (p) log (p + 2) for p and p + 2 on both sides of x (p = x - 1,p + 2 = x + 1) does not depend on x and we have simply that

[formula]

It can be contrasted with the calculation of the Brun constant

[formula]

The probability to find a pair of twins in the vicinity of x is 2C2  /   log 2(x), so the expected value of the finite approximation to the Brun constant can be estimated as follows:

[formula]

It means that the plot of finite approximations B2(x) to the original Brun constant is a linear function of 1 /  log (x) [\cite=Brun] and from the partial sum B(x) calculated on the computer up to x the limiting value can be extrapolated by adding 4C2  /   log (x): B  =  B(x) + 4C2  /   log (x). To gain some idea what value of the limit can be the extrapolated from numbers in Table I the Figure 1 presents actual values of the mean value of log (p) log (p + 2) plotted against 1 / N. Fitting the straight line to these points by least square method gives the intercept (what corresponds to N =   ∞  ) 1.3200385787619. In fact we see in Table I shortage of twins in the interval (226,231) and in the next intervals some surplus of twins. Thus skipping the first 10 points and fitting straight line in the interval (232,240) (in fact only two points are needed to determine straight line!) I got for the limiting value of the intercept 1.3203501777.
