Singularities of linear systems and the Waring Problem

Introduction

Edward Waring stated in 1770 that every integer is a sum of at most 9 positive integral cubes, also a sum of at most 19 biquadrates and so on. Later on Jacobi and others considered the problem to find all the decompositions of a given number into the least number of powers, [\cite=Di]. In this paper I am concerned with a similar question for general homogeneous forms.

Let f be any form of degree d in n + 1 variables over the complex numbers. It is easy to prove that f can be decomposed additively in powers of linear forms. That is [formula] for li linear forms. Indeed this is equivalent to the non degeneracy of the Veronese embedding [formula], where Sd is the vector space of degree d polynomials in [formula]. Moreover the minimum s for which [formula] gives the least number of factors in the decomposition of a general form f. It is now well known that Alexander-Hirschowitz result, [\cite=AH2], allows to give a statement, similar to Waring's one, for addictive decomposition of general homogeneous forms. This has been first noticed by Iarrobino, [\cite=Ia], using apolarity and inverse systems. The way I prefer to look at it, it is through Terracini lemma.

As Jacobi did for the original Waring problem, also the Waring problem for forms has been investigated in the attempt to understand all possible decompositions of a given form. By means of Hilbert schemes or Grassmannians one can give the structure of an algebraic variety to the set of decompositions of a given form. In this way Mukai gave a description of the Fano 3-fold V22 as the variety representing all decompositions of a plane quartic, [\cite=Mu]. Iliev, Ranestad and Schreyer applied similar arguments to other special cases, [\cite=RS], [\cite=IR1] and [\cite=IR2]. Classic works of Sylvester, Reye, Richmond, Hilbert and Palatini investigated the case in which the decomposition is unique. More recently Iarrobino and Kanev treated the same problem for special forms, [\cite=IK], see remark [\ref=rem:ia]. The following list is taken almost verbatim from [\cite=RS]. A general form f of degree d in n  +  1 variables has a unique presentation as a sum of s powers of linear forms in the following cases:

n  =  1, d  =  2k  -  1 and s  =  k, [\cite=Sy]

n  =  3, d  =  3 and s  =  5 Sylvester's Pentahedral Theorem [\cite=Sy]

n  =  2, d  =  5 and s  =  7 [\cite=Hi], [\cite=Ri], [\cite=Pa].

In this paper I prove that if d > n there are no further examples. More precisely I have the following. To prove Theorem [\ref=th:1] I use the geometric interpretation sketched before. In particular I translate the uniqueness assumption into a statement about singularities of linear systems with imposed singularities. Next I study the singularities of this linear systems. This is an interesting problem in itself. Let me introduce it. Consider integers (d,n,l). One wants to understand the singularities of a general hypersurface F of degree d that is singular at l general points of the projective space [formula]. I expect that when l is as high as possible there is no room, in general, for other singularities. That is F has only ordinary double points at the imposed singularities and it is smooth elsewhere. On the other hand if this is true for the highest l then it is a fortiori true for lower impositions. Therefore one can expect that, with few exceptions, F is irreducible and it has only l ordinary double points. For [formula] this has been classically studied and it is the content of a theorem of Arbarello-Cornalba, [\cite=AC].

The starting point, to extend Arbarello-Cornalba's result to higher dimension, are the beautiful papers of Alexander-Hirschowitz, [\cite=AH1] [\cite=AH2]. I will base not only on their result but also on their degeneration idea to reach my goal. Indeed to determine the singularities of F one can consider a suitable degeneration of it. This is done, in the full spirit of A-H, specializing a bunch of points to an hyperplane. Then an infinitesimal Bertini Theorem, [\cite=CC], similar to A-C argument for plane curves allows to determine the singularities on F.

The A-H technique consists in choosing numbers in a clever way. In such a way that one can prove the statement by a double induction on degree and dimension. Furthermore when the numbers are not amicable they use the differentiable Horace Lemma to pop out some points from the hyperplane back to [formula]. Unfortunately I am not able to apply Horace Lemma, because I loose control on the singularities of the specialized linear system. Furthermore singularities behaves better in a degree induction than in the dimensional one. For these reasons I have to develop a slightly different approach. I play the full induction on the degree when l is "small", see Theorem [\ref=th:can]. Then the result I need for Theorem [\ref=th:1], and also a bit more, is obtained in one step using the small l case for degree d - 1, see Theorem [\ref=th:fc]. The latter has an application to weakly defectiveness of Veronese embedding, Corollary [\ref=co:ver].

Here is an outline of the paper. In section [\ref=sec:not] I introduce the main notations, definitions and results that will be used throughout the paper. In particular a Lemma on the upper semi-continuity of the dimension of singularities is established. In section [\ref=sec:war] I explain how to pass from uniqueness in the Waring problem to a singularity statement. In doing this I show the rationality of varieties with one apparent (k + 1)-tuple secant [formula], improving on results of [\cite=CMR], see also [\cite=CR].

In section [\ref=sec:win] I prove the main numerology to speed up the induction of the main theorem about singularities of linear systems. Section [\ref=sec:main] is the core of the induction and contains the main result on singularities. Finally I prove Theorem [\ref=th:1].

I started to work on this problem during a short visit at Università Tor Vergata in Roma. It is a pleasure to thank Ciro Ciliberto and Francesco Russo for discussions, motivations and interest in this project.

Notations and preliminaries

Unless otherwise stated I work over the field of complex numbers. First I introduce what is needed to study linear systems with prescribed singularities.

Let [formula] be a point. The double point at p in [formula] is the scheme given by the square of the ideal sheaf of p. If [formula] is a collection of points, I denote by P2 the double points supported on P. In particular the linear system |IP2(d)| is given by hypersurfaces of degree d singular at P.

Given a collection of points [formula], with Q supported on an hyperplane H, let [formula] be the residual of X2 with respect to H. That is [formula]. Then there is the Castelnuovo exact sequence given by

[formula]

This gives the following sequence on cohomology

[formula]

Consider a collection P, of l general points in [formula]. Define

[formula]

Fix an hyperplane H and a collection [formula], where P is given by (l - h) general points in [formula], and [formula] is given by h general points in H. Define

[formula]

In this paper I am interested in non empty linear systems of type Gd,n,l, for this I introduce the following definition.

I say that the linear system Gd,n,l is expected if

[formula]

Moreover if Gd,n,l is expected and dim Gd,n,l  ≥  0 I say that it is expected and effective Note that if Gd,n,l is expected and effective then Gd,n,l' is expected and effective for any l' < l. Similarly for linear systems of type H. I say that HH,d,n,l,h is expected and effective if

[formula]

Note that if HH,d,n,l,h is expected and effective then by semi-continuity Gd,n,l is expected and effective. In the following I frequently ask expected and effective linear systems of type H to satisfy the following further properties. The linear system HH,d,n,l,h is what I need () if

HH,d,n,l,h is expected and effective,

[formula]

([\ref=eq:exseq]) is a short exact sequence.

The following is a weak form of the main result of [\cite=AH2].

Let k be an infinite field and assume that n  ≥  2 and d > 2. Then Gd,n,l is expected and effective if [formula].

Furthermore if dim Gd,n,l  ≥  0 and Gd,n,l is not expected and effective then [formula], dim Gd,n,l = 0, and (d,n,l) = (3,4,7),(4,2,5),(4,3,9),(4,4,14).

The aim is to prove the statement on singularities by degeneration. To do this I need to control how the singularities behaves under specializations. This is the content of the next Lemma and Corollary.

Let Δ be a complex disk around the origin. Consider the product [formula], with the natural projections, π1 and π2. Let [formula] and [formula]. Fix a configuration [formula] of l points on V0 and let σi:Δ  →  V be sections such that σi(0) = pi and [formula] are general points of Vt for t  ≠  0. Let [formula].

Consider the linear system [formula]. Assume that [formula] and dim H0  =   dim Ht, for t∈Δ. Let [formula] and [formula]. Then for t  ≠  0, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let ξi be the generic point of σi(Δ) and [formula]. Let [formula], then by Theorem [\ref=th:AH], applied to the field [formula], I have

[formula]

Let D∈H be a general element then D|Vt is a general element in Ht. In particular [formula] and I can assume, by Bertini Theorem, that [formula], for t  ≠  0. The former, together with the semi-continuity of the dimension of fibers, show that ψi(t)  ≤  ψi(0). The variety Vt is a Cartier divisor therefore

[formula]

This gives

[formula]

To conclude observe that since the points are general a monodromy argument shows that φi(t) = φj(t), for t  ≠  0, and similarly for functions ψi.

Assume that HH,d,n,l,h is and there exists D∈HH,d,n,l,h with isolated singularities at some point p∈P. Then the general element G∈Gd,n,l has only ordinary double points.

The linear system HH,l,d,n,h is . In particular there exists a degeneration like the one described in Lemma [\ref=le:dimsing] with H0  =  HH,l,d,n,h. The Lemma ensures that [formula]. Then by [\cite=CC] G has only ordinary double points.

Let me recall, next, the main definitions and results concerning secant varieties. Let Gk  =  G(k,N) be the Grassmannian of k-linear spaces in [formula]. Let [formula] be an irreducible variety

[formula]

the closure of the graph of

[formula]

taking [formula] to the

[formula]

S(X):=π(Γ(X))⊂.

[formula]

I={(x,Λ)| x∈ Λ}⊂×,

[formula]

(X):=π(S(X))⊂ I.

[formula]

ec(X):=π(Sec(X))⊂.

[formula]

dimec(x)<min{dim(X),N}

[formula]

ec(X) = 〈 X,, X〉

[formula]

From uniqueness to singularities

Let [formula] be the d-uple Veronese embedding of [formula]. I already observed, see [\cite=Ci] for a deeper account, that the problem of finding the minimal number of linear forms needed to express a general form of degree d is equivalent to determine the dimension of [formula]. A general form f of degree d is just a general point [formula]. The number of representations of f as a sum of (k + 1) powers of linear forms correspond to the number of (k + 1)-secant linear spaces to [formula] passing through p. If there is just one I will say that there exists the canonical form. Note that [formula] and [formula] therefore there are finitely many representations only if [formula] is an integer.

Assume that [formula] is an integer. Consider the natural map

[formula]

then the canonical form exists only if π1 is dominant and birational. The following is a generalization of [\cite=CMR], see also [\cite=CR].

Let [formula] be an irreducible variety of dimension n. Assume that the natural map [formula] is dominant and birational. Let [formula] be a general point. Consider [formula] the projection from the embedded tangent space [formula]. Then [formula] is dominant and birational.

Choose a general point z on a general k-secant [formula]. Let [formula] be the blow up of [formula] with exceptional divisor E, and fiber Fz = f- 1(z). Let y∈Fz be a general point. This point uniquely determines a linear space Π of dimension k(n + 1) that contains [formula]. Then the projection [formula] is birational if and only if [formula] consists of just one point.

Assume that there exist two points x1 and x2 in [formula]. By Terracini Lemma, Theorem [\ref=th:terracini],

[formula]

Consider the linear spaces [formula] and [formula]. The Trisecant Lemma, see for instance [\cite=CC], yields Λ1  ≠  Λ2. Let ΛY1, ΛY2 and ΠY be the strict transforms on Y. Since [formula] and [formula] then both ΛY1 and ΛY2 contain the point y∈Fz. In particular I have

[formula]

Let [formula] be the morphism from the abstract secant variety, and μ:U  →  Y the induced morphism. That is [formula]. Then there exists a commutative diagram

[formula]

Let λi and ΛUi be the strict transform of Λi in [formula] and U respectively. By Remark [\ref=re:vuoto] [formula], so that

[formula]

This proves that μ- 1 is not defined on y, a general point of the divisor E. That is μ, and henceforth π1, are not birational.

A variety [formula] is said to have one apparent (h + 1)-tuple [formula] if there exists and is unique a (h + 1)-secant [formula] through the general point of [formula], for wider discussions and properties of these varieties I recommend [\cite=CR]. In this dictionary Theorem [\ref=th:proj] proves that a variety with one apparent (h + 1)-tuple [formula] is rational. This extends the result of [\cite=CMR] for varieties with one apparent double point, see also [\cite=CR].

Let [formula] be an integer and [formula] the projection from a general tangent space to [formula]. Theorem [\ref=th:proj], says that the canonical form exists, only if [formula] is birational. Terracini Lemma shows that [formula] is the map induced by Gd,n,k. Therefore to have the canonical form the linear system Gd,n,k has to be expected and effective and the map associated to Gd,n,k has to be birational onto [formula]. The final brick of the bridge, is the original statement of Noether-Fano inequalities, reinterpreted in modern terminology.

Let L be a linear system, without fixed components, of forms of degree d on [formula]. Assume that dim L = n and the rational map associated to L, is birational. Then [formula] has not canonical singularities.

I have proved the following necessary condition

Let f be a general homogeneous form of degree d in n + 1 variables, with n  ≥  2. Then f is expressible as sum of (k + 1) powers of linear forms in a unique way only if the pair [formula] has not canonical singularities, where [formula] is an integer.

To test this condition I have to understand the singularities of the linear system Gd,n,k. I will do it by a degeneration argument. First I have to establish some good degenerations. This is the content of the following section.

Numerical conditions to be

In this section I establish sufficient conditions for a linear system of type H to be . This is just a, maybe pedant, way to break the main induction argument in small pieces.

Let [formula] be an hyperplane and assume that Gd,n,l, Gd - 1,n,l - h, are expected and effective and Gd,n - 1,h is expected. Assume further that

[formula]

Then HH,d,n,l,h is .

Let [formula] be as in Definition [\ref=def:h], where [formula]. By hypothesis Gd,n,l is expected and effective and by semi-continuity I have to prove that

[formula]

Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

By sequence ([\ref=eq:exseq]) I have

[formula]

By hypothesis Gd,n - 1,h is expected therefore

[formula]

The claim is therefore equivalent to prove that

[formula]

Indeed this yields

[formula]

and [formula]. As a consequence I get the exactness of sequence ([\ref=eq:exseq]).

By hypothesis Gd - 1,n,l - h is expected and effective, that is

[formula]

Hence to prove equation ([\ref=eq:tbp]) it is enough to show that the h points on H impose independent conditions to Gd - 1,n,l - h. This is equivalent to ask that

[formula]

(the h - 1 is not a misprint). That is to say

[formula]

I can therefore conclude by equation ([\ref=eq:bound]) that

[formula]

Next I translate the expected and effective conditions of Lemma [\ref=le:dimbase] into numerical conditions.

Fix integers n  ≥  3, d  ≥  3, l > h, and an hyperplane [formula], together with the following conditions:

[formula]

either [formula] or [formula] and Gd,n - 1,h is expected

[formula]

[formula]

l - h > n

[formula] and h = l - 1.

Then the linear system HH,d,n,l,h is if one of the following set of conditions are satisfied:

d  ≥  5 and (L), (H), (LH), (C)

d = 4 and (L), (H), (LH), (C), (D4)

d = 3 and (D3).

I will check that the hypothesis of Lemma [\ref=le:dimbase] are satisfied for every set of conditions. Hypothesis (L) and (H) together with Theorem [\ref=th:AH] ensure that Gd,n,l is expected and effective and Gd,n - 1,h is expected.

First note that for d = 3 condition (D3) forces condition (L), (H), and (C). Indeed I have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover G2,n,1 is expected and effective and G1,n,1 is empty. Therefore I can apply Lemma [\ref=le:dimbase] to conclude.

If d > 3 condition (LH), together with Theorem [\ref=th:AH] shows that Gd - 1,n,l - h is expected and effective.

If Gd - 2,n,l - h is empty then, by condition (C), I conclude by Lemma [\ref=le:dimbase]. This is always the case for d = 4.

Assume that [formula] and dim Gd - 2,n,l - h is not empty. If Gd - 2,n,h is not expected and effective then by Theorem [\ref=th:AH] dim Gd - 2,n,l - h = 0 and by condition (C) I conclude with Lemma [\ref=le:dimbase]. If Gd - 2,n,h is expected and effective then note that

[formula]

therefore condition (H) yields

[formula]

and I can apply Lemma [\ref=le:dimbase] to conclude.

The following Lemma allows to play induction for "small" l. Before starting the proof it is convenient to introduce a definition

For integers a and b let [formula].

Fix an hyperplane [formula]. Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Assume that d  ≥  4 and n  ≥  3 then HH,d,n,l,h is .

Note that (ld - hd) = ld - 1. First I simplify the expressions of h and l,

[formula]

where I collected all the fractional parts in the term

[formula]

in particular [formula];

[formula]

where the fractional part is

[formula]

this time [formula]. Incidentally this shows that both l and l - h are positive integers.

The plan is to prove the claim by checking the conditions of Lemma [\ref=le:dim].

Condition (H) in Lemma [\ref=le:dim] is given by equation ([\ref=eq:h]) and the following inequality

[formula]

which is true for any d  ≥  4 and n  ≥  4. In the missing case, namely (n,d) = (3,4), I have [formula].

Condition (L) is obtained by equation ([\ref=eq:l]) and the following inequality

[formula]

which is verified for any d  ≥  3 and n  ≥  3.

As observed condition (LH) is just condition (L) for d - 1.

To check condition (C) note that by equations ([\ref=eq:h]) and ([\ref=eq:l])

[formula]

The requested bound is therefore implied by

[formula]

This is verified for d  ≥  4 and n  ≥  7 or d  ≥  5 and n  ≥  5 or d  ≥  6 and n  ≥  4 or d  ≥  8 and n  ≥  3. The remaining cases can be checked by a direct computation. Let [formula] then

[formula]

If d = 4 I have to prove (D4), by definition

[formula]

Expanding the binomial I get

[formula]

The requested bound is therefore implied by

[formula]

This is verified for n  ≥  4. For n = 3 I have l - h = 9 - 5 > 3 = n.

Singularities of linear systems

This is the unique result I have about singularities of cubic forms.

Let G∈Gd,n,l be a general element. Assume that either

d  ≥  4, n  ≥  3, and [formula], or

d = 3, n  ≥  3 and [formula].

Then Gd,n,l is expected and effective and G has only ordinary double points.

Like in the interpolation problem cubics are kind of difficult because the degeneration technique does not work for the highest possible values of l. Nevertheless this is what is needed to conclude for degree at least 4.

I prove the claim by induction on d.

Assume that d  ≥  4. Let [formula] and h = l - l'. Fix a general hyperplane [formula], then by Lemma [\ref=le:lh] HH,d,n,l,h is . This proves that Gd,n,l is expected and effective. Since [formula] I can look the linear system HH,d,n,l,h from a different viewpoint. Choose l - h general points in [formula], [formula]. Let

[formula]

be a general element. Choose a general hyperplane [formula] and h general points on [formula], [formula].

By induction hypothesis D has only ordinary double points. Therefore the general element of HH,d,n,l,h has only isolated singularities at the pis and by Corollary [\ref=co:sdp] the general element of Gd,n,l has only ordinary double points.

To conclude I need to prove the first step of induction. If d = 3 one gets

[formula]

and

[formula]

This proves condition (D3) for n  ≥  5. Therefore HH,3,l,l - 1 is and there is at least one divisor D∈HH,3,l,l - 1 with D = Q + H with Q a quadric cone. This together with Corollary [\ref=co:sdp] proves the theorem for n  ≥  5. For n = 3,4 note that l is, respectively, at most 4 and 5. Then I do not need any specialization. The linear system Gd,n,l always contain a reducible divisor Q + H where Q is a quadric cone.

I am now ready to prove the main result about forms with assigned singularities.

Assume that n  ≥  3 and d  ≥  3 and either

[formula] and n⌈n  -  1,d  +  1⌉ - (n + 1)⌈n,d  +  1⌉ + 1 > 0, or

[formula] or

[formula], ⌈n  -  1,d  +  1⌉ = 0 and either d  ≥  4 or d = 3 and n  ≥  6.

Then the general element in Gd + 1,n,li has only ordinary double points.

The n = 2 case is well known, [\cite=AC]. I will recall it in Lemma [\ref=le:p2]. Note that for n = 2, d = 6, and l = 9 the unique 6-ic with 9 general double points is a double cubic. For n = 3 there is another exception. Consider G4,3,8 a dimension count shows that G4,3,8  =  {Q21,Q22,Q1Q2}, where Qi are the quadrics passing simply through the 8 points. In particular the general element of G4,3,8 has a curve of singularities. I believe that there are very few expected and effective linear systems Gd,n,l with non isolated singularities. Maybe these are the only ones. It would be interesting to classify them all, see Corollary [\ref=co:num] for a partial result in this direction. Note that all linear systems that are not expected have non isolated singularities.

The Veronese embedding [formula] is not k-weakly defective for d  ≥  4 and n  ≥  3 if [formula].

Luca Chiantini and Ciro Ciliberto pointed me out the following consequence of non weakly defectiveness of the Veronese embedding. Assume that [formula] is not k-weakly defective. Let [formula] be a general point. Then, by Terracini Lemma, there exists a unique [formula] which is (k + 1)-secant through x. That is the natural map [formula] is birational onto the image. This improves results of [\cite=IK] where this statement was proved for [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be integers. Note that if either d  ≥  4 or d = 3 and n  ≥  6 then by Theorem [\ref=th:AH] the linear system Gd + 1,n - 1,h2 is expected. Theorem [\ref=th:can] shows that the general element D∈Gd,n,li - hi has only ordinary double points. Consider the linear systems HH,d + 1,n,li,hi. By hypothesis I have

[formula]

and, for i = 1,2

[formula]

This proves, via Lemma [\ref=le:dim], that HH,d + 1,n,li,hi is , for d  ≥  4. For d = 3 note that

[formula]

for i = 0,1,2. Then li - hi > n for n  ≥  5 and, via Lemma [\ref=le:dim], HH,d + 1,n,li,hi is in these cases. The leftover has to be checked directly. If (d,n) = (3,4) I have l0 - 1 = l1 = 12 and h1 = 8. If (d,n) = (3,3) I have l1 = 7, h1 = 3. Therefore I can apply Lemma [\ref=le:dim] for HH,4,3,li,hi, with i = 0,1. and HH,4,4,l0,h0. For HH,4,4,l1,h1 note that

[formula]

This time I use Lemma [\ref=le:dimbase] to conclude that HH,4,4,l1,h1 is .

I can, therefore, assume that D + H∈HH,d + 1,n,li,hi for D∈Gd,n,li - hi with only ordinary double points. This together with Corollary [\ref=co:sdp] conclude the proof.

I can use the above theorem to determine the singularities of Gd,n,l for d  ≥  5 prime and d = 4.

Assume that Gd,n,l is effective. Then the general element G∈Gd,n,l has ordinary double points if either d = 4, and (n,l)  ≠  (3,8),(3,9) or d  ≥  5 is a prime. I already described the exceptions.

Note that

[formula]

Note that both

[formula]

and

[formula]

are integers. Furthermore for some 1  ≤  a  ≤  d I have [formula]. Assume that d is a prime. Then either ⌈n,d⌉ or ⌈n  -  1,d⌉ vanish and I can apply Theorem [\ref=th:fc] for any triple (d,n,l) with Gd,n,l effective.

Assume that d = 4, this time

[formula]

If [formula] I have [formula]. While if [formula] I have [formula]. This yields that either ⌈n,4⌉ = 0 or ⌈n  -  1,4⌉ = 0. This proves the claim, by Theorem [\ref=th:fc], for n  ≥  6. If n = 2,4,5 it is easy to check that ⌈n,4⌉ = 0. This concludes the proof.

Note that for (d,n,l) = (6,9,500) the conditions of Theorem [\ref=th:fc] are not satisfied. This is the first occurrence that I cannot treat in degree 6. I have not statement, similar to Corollary [\ref=co:num], for fixed n and any d.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:1]

I am now in the condition to prove Theorem [\ref=th:1]. The following lemma allows to treat the two dimensional case.

Let [formula], then [formula] has canonical singularities.

Let G∈Gd,n,l be a general element. Then by [\cite=CC] either G has only the imposed ordinary double points, or it has a fixed component of singularities passing through P. The latter is easily seen, by a dimension count, to be possible only for d = 6 and l = 9. In this special case the unique 6-ic with assigned 9 double points is a double cubic. Thus G has only double points and [formula] has canonical singularities.

I already observed, proposition [\ref=pro:bridge], that for the existence of the canonical form

[formula]

has to be an integer, and [formula] has to be not canonical.

If n = 2 this means that either d = 4,5 or d  ≥  7. If d = 4 I have k = 4, and d2 = 16 = 4k. In particular the map associated to G4,2,4 is composed with a pencil. Note that dim G4,2,5 = 0 and G4,2,5 is not expected. If d = 5 I have k = 6 and d2 = 25 = 4k + 1. It is not difficult to see that the scheme base locus of G5,2,6 is just P2. In this case we already known that there exists a canonical form, [\cite=Hi]. Assume that d  ≥  7 then [\cite=AC] shows that Gd,2,k does not have fixed components and by Lemma [\ref=le:p2] [formula] has canonical singularities. Therefore uniqueness is impossible.

If n  ≥  3 then by Theorem [\ref=th:fc] the general element G∈Gd,n,k has only ordinary double points. In particular the divisor G is irreducible and after the blow up of the singular points it is smooth. This proves that the log pair [formula] has canonical singularities and concludes the proof.

To extend Theorem [\ref=th:1] to lower degree one has to study the base locus of Gd,n,l and not only its singularities. The semi-continuity works for the dimension of the Base Locus. Furthermore, with similar argument it is possible to prove that functions ψi of Lemma [\ref=le:dimsing] are zero at least for "small" l. What is completely missing is a way to determine the scheme base locus out of these informations.

Theorem [\ref=th:1] together with the known exceptions allow to answer the uniqueness question for forms of at most 4 variables.

Let f be an homogeneous form of degree d in n + 1 variables. If n  ≤  3 then canonical form exists if and only if (d,n) = (2k + 1,1),(5,2),(3,3).
