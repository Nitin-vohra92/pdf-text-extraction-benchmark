§ 1. Introduction

There are different approaches to define the crossed product of a C*-algebra by a semigroup of endomorphisms in the works of G. Murphy, I. Raeburn, M. Laca and others (see [\cite=M1], [\cite=M2], [\cite=LR], [\cite=LiR], [\cite=F]). They are using covariant isometric or partial isometric representations of the positive cone in a totally ordered abelian group, are realizing the crossed product by a cancellative abelian semigroup of injective endomorphisms as a corner of the covariance algebra of a classical C*-dynamical system, or are using a family of Hilbert bimodules indexed by the quasi-lattice ordered semigroup and generalized Cuntz-Pimsner algebras .

Our examples are mainly related to an abelian [formula]- dynamical system, and we will consider in section 2 a groupoid approach, similar to [\cite=D], and a Hilbert bimodule approach in the next section. We will see how the definition of the inner product, right and left actions will affect the outcome, and how the dynamics of the [formula]-action is reflected in the corresponding C*-algebra. We define the inner products by using the transfer operators associated to some conditional expectations onto the ranges of the endomorphisms as in [\cite=E1],[\cite=E2]. In the case of local homeomorphisms, the resulting Hilbert bimodules are finitely generated and projective, therefore the left action consists entirely of compact operators. In general, the transfer operators are defined using a family of measures as in [\cite=Br], and it may happen that the left action has trivial intersection with the compacts. For two commuting endomorphisms, we will construct a product system of Hilbert bimodules over the semigroup [formula](see [\cite=F]), and the corresponding Cuntz-Pimsner algebra will play the role of the groupoid algebra. Sometimes, this algebra could be understood as an iterated Pimsner construction, by extending the scalars and by using the universal properties.

§ 2. The groupoid approach

Consider a compact space X with two commuting continuous open surjections σ1,σ2:X  →  X. In analogy to the groupoids associated to a covering map (see [\cite=D]), we define the equivalence relations

[formula]

Here n = (n1,n2) and σn  =  σn11σn22. We consider [formula] directed by the partial order

[formula]

We put the induced topology on Rn, and the inductive limit topology on R.

Proposition 1. If σi are local homeomorphisms, then all Rn are r-discrete, C*(R) is well defined, and

[formula]

Proof. See pages 122-123 in [\cite=Re].

Let [formula] With the usual operations,

[formula]

Γ is a groupoid with the unit space identified with X. The isotropy group bundle is

[formula]

Proposition 2. If all the equivalence relations Rn are r-discrete, then Γ is a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid with a Haar system.

Proof. The topology of Γ is defined by the cylinder sets

[formula]

where [formula], and U and V are open sets of X such that σp|U and σq|V are homeomorphisms. A Haar system on R could be extended to Γ.

Remark 1. Assuming that C*(Γ) is well defined (which certainly happens in the case σi are local homeomorphisms), the cocycle

[formula]

induces a [formula]-action on C*(Γ), via

[formula]

Remark 2. If σi are homeomorphisms, then C*(Γ) is isomorphic to the usual crossed product [formula]. In general, we will see that C*(Γ) is a certain crossed product of C(X) by the semigroup [formula].

Definition. The orbit of x∈X is defined to be

[formula]

where σ- ky = {z∈X|σkz = y}.

We say that σ is minimal if each orbit is dense and that σ is essentially free if

[formula]

is dense in X.

Proposition 3. If σ is minimal, then C*(R) is simple. Moreover, if σ is essentially free, then C*(Γ) is also simple.

Proof. Since σ is minimal and

[formula]

it follows that there are no nontrivial open invariant subsets. If σ is also essentially free, then the groupoid Γ is essentially principal in the sense of Renault (see definition II.4.3 of [\cite=Re]). We can apply proposition II.4.6 of [\cite=Re], where the ideals of an essentially principal groupoid are characterized.

Example 1. Consider X the infinite path space of a rank two graph in the sense of Kumjian and Pask, and σ1,σ2 the horizontal and vertical shifts, which are local homeomorphisms (see [\cite=KP]). For simplicity, we describe X in a particular situation. Start with two finite graphs (G1,V) and (G2,V) with the same set of vertices V, such that there is a bijection [formula]. Here

[formula]

where s and r are the source and range maps. For example, this happens if the vertex matrices commute. Then X could be thought as an infinite grid in the first quadrant, where the vertices at the lattice points are joined by horizontal edges (from G1) and vertical edges (from G2). The unique factorization property translates in the fact that the bijection ρ determines the other two edges of each unit square, once we fix a horizontal edge, followed by a vertical edge (see section 6 in [\cite=KP]). It follows that any finite rectangular grid is determined by one horizontal side e1e2...em and one vertical side f1f2...fn. This ensures that σi are local homeomorphisms of the Cantor set X.

The C*-algebra of the corresponding groupoid Γ is strongly Morita equivalent to a crossed product of an AF-algebra by the group [formula]. Under some mild conditions, the groupoid is essentially free, and the C*-algebra is simple and purely infinite (see section 4 in [\cite=KP]).

Example 2. Let X be the unit circle [formula], and σ1,σ2 two covering maps, of indices p1 and p2, respectively, with |pi|  ≥  2. In this case, each C*(Rn) is of the form [formula] for some positive integer k = k(n), C*(R) is a circle algebra, and C*(Γ) is simple and purely infinite, since the orbits are dense, and the groupoid is essentially free and locally contracting (see [\cite=A-D]).

Example 3 (Ledrappier). Let [formula] be the subgroup defined by

[formula]

The admissible patterns are

[formula]

The maps σ1 and σ2 are the horizontal and the vertical shifts, which are local homeomorphisms in this case. Indeed, let x∈X be fixed, and consider the open neighborhood of x, defined by

[formula]

Then σ1(U) = X, and if y,z∈U with σ1(y) = σ1(z), then y(i,j) = z(i,j) for all i  ≥  1,  j  ≥  0. But also y(0,0) = z(0,0) = x(0,0), and since the only admissible patterns are the ones in P, we get y(0,1) = z(0,1). By induction, we get y(0,j) = z(0,j) for all j  ≥  0, therefore y = z and σ1|U is one to one. Similarly, σ2 is a local homeomorphism.

The C*-algebra C*(R) is isomorphic to the CAR algebra UHF(2∞), and C*(Γ) is again strongly Morita equivalent to a crossed product of an AF-algebra by [formula], like in the case of a rank 2 graph.

More general, we may consider V to be a finite alphabet and a closed subset [formula] (in the product topology) that is σ-invariant, where

[formula]

Such a dynamical system (X,σ) is a (two-dimensional) Markov shift or a subshift of finite type if there exists a finite set [formula] and a set of admissible patterns P  ⊂  VF such that

[formula]

where πF is the projection onto VF. If the shift maps are local homeomorphisms, then the C*-algebra C*(Γ) will be strongly Morita equivalent to a crossed product of an AF-algebra by [formula]. But, in general, the shift maps are not local homeomorphisms, as it can be seen in the case of the full shift [formula]. The equivalence classes in the equivalence relations Rn are not discrete anymore, in fact they are Cantor sets. For other interesting examples of higher dimensional subshifts of finite type, see [\cite=S].

§ 3. The Hilbert bimodule approach

For a C*-algebra A and an injective unital endomorphism α∈End(A) such that there is a conditional expectation P onto the range α(A), one can define a Hilbert bimodule E = A(α,P), using the transfer operator [formula] (see [\cite=E1], [\cite=E2]). We start with the vector space A, and define the inner product, right and left multiplications by the equations

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

[formula]

Using the Pimsner construction (see [\cite=P]), we get a Cuntz-Pimsner algebra OA(α,P). Recall

Definition. A Toeplitz representation of a Hilbert A-bimodule E in a C*-algebra B is a pair (ψ,π) with ψ:E  →  B a linear map and π:A  →  B a homomorphism, such that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The corresponding universal C*-algebra is called the Toeplitz algebra of E, denoted by TE. There is a homomorphism π(1):K(E)  →  B which satisfies

[formula]

We say that (ψ,π) is Cuntz-Pimsner covariant if

[formula]

where φ:A  →  L(E) is the left action. The Cuntz-Pimsner algebra OE is universal for Toeplitz representations which are Cuntz-Pimsner covariant. There is a gauge action of the circle group [formula] on OE, and the fixed point algebra is denoted by FE.

Example 1. For A = C(X) and α induced by a local homeomorphism σ:X  →  X, we can take

[formula]

where ν(x) is the number of elements in the fiber σ- 1(x). The corresponding algebra OA(α,P) is isomorphic to C*(Γ(σ)), where Γ(σ) is the Renault groupoid as in [\cite=D],

[formula]

Indeed, it is known that [formula], where E* is the adjoint of E. That means E* = C(X) with the conjugate multiplication of scalars, and with the left and right actions of A interchanged. Since [formula], it follows that ξ(x)f(σ(x))η*(y) = ξ(x)f(σ(y))η*(y) for all (x,y)∈X  ×  X and f∈C(X). Hence σ(x) = σ(y), and K(E) = C(R1) as sets. We have

[formula]

therefore

[formula]

and the multiplication of compact operators is exactly the convolution product on C(R1). Hence, K(E) = C*(R1) as C*-algebras. In the same way, using the fact that [formula], we get [formula]. Taking inductive limits, it follows that FE = C*(R), since in this case FE is generated by all [formula]. The isometry v which induces the corner endomorphism of C*(R) is induced by the function γ(x) = 1, regarded as an element of E. Indeed, <  γ,γ >  = 1, therefore ψ(γ) is an isometry in any Cuntz-Pimsner representation. The endomorphism of FE is given by the formula

[formula]

Remark. The above Cuntz-Pimsner algebra OA(α,P) could also be described as the universal C*-algebra generated by a copy of C(X) and an isometry S subject to the relations

[formula]

for all f∈C(X) where

[formula]

and {u1,u2,...,um}  ⊂  C(X) such that [formula] for all f∈C(X) (Theorem 9.2. in [\cite=EV]). The corresponding Toeplitz algebra TA(α,P) satisfies only the first two relations.

Note. If σ:X  →  X is continuous, open and surjective, but not a local homeomorphism, the groupoid construction from [\cite=D] may fail. The equivalence relation R does not have an obvious Haar system, since the Haar systems on Rn may not be compatible. Since Rn is not necessarily an open subset of Rm for n  ≤  m, a continuous function on Rn has no natural extension to a function on Rm.

Example 2. Let [formula] and σ(x1,x2,...) = (x2,x3,...). Then σ is not a local homeomorphism, in fact the fibers are homeomorphic to the interval . Also, Rn  ⊂  Rn + 1 is not open, therefore we can not conclude that a continuous function on Rn is naturally extended to a continuous function on Rn + 1. We try to overcome the lack of an obvious groupoid by using the existence of certain families of measures on the fibers of σ which will define a transfer operator and a Hilbert bimodule over C(X).

Definition. Suppose that π:X  →  Y is a continuous open surjection between locally compact Hausdorff spaces. A family λ  =  {λy}y∈Y of positive Radon measures on X is called a π-system if the support of λy is contained in π- 1(y) for each y∈Y, and for each f∈Cc(X), the function

[formula]

lies in Cc(Y). We say that a π-system is full if the support of each λy is all of π- 1(y). The existence of a full π-system is proved in ([\cite=Bl], Théorème 3.3) for X separable and Y second countable.

For the above example, one can take the usual Lebesgue measure on
