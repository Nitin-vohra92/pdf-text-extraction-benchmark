Continuum-wise expansive homeomorphisms on Peano continua

A homeomorphism f of a compact metric space (X,d) is continuum-wise expansive (cw-expansive) if there exists a constant α > 0 such that [formula] for all non trivial continua C. This notion was introduced in [\cite=kato_cw], and is a generalization of expansive homeomorphisms: those verifying, for some fixed α > 0, that [formula] for all x  ≠  y. Both notions are topological invariants. Examples of cw-expansive homeomorphisms that are not expansive are non-expansive homeomorphisms of totally disconnected spaces.

We shall use the following notations: for ε > 0 we define the local stable and unstable set of x, respectively, as:

[formula]

These sets are important in analyzing and classifying expansive dynamics, though in the case of cw-expansive homeomorphisms, it seems more reasonable to study the stable and unstable component of x, that is:

[formula]

We obtain the following result for cw-expansive homeomorphisms acting on Peano continua: We recall that a Peano continuum is a locally connected continuum. In particular, we have: In §[\ref=condiciones_generales], sufficient conditions are found for a point in a general compactum to verify [formula]. No example of a cw-expansive homeomorphisms of a Peano curve is known; and, in fact it is an open question whether there is a Peano curve admitting an expansive homeomorphism. In [\cite=ktt] it was shown, by using techniques in [\cite=h] [\cite=l] that a Peano curve admitting an expansive homeomorphism is nowhere planar, nowhere rim-countable and consists of a finite number of cyclic elements. We obtain here a cw-expansive partial version of this: We must remark, however, that the following question remains open Observe that obtaining non trivial stable and unstable components is not enough to apply techniques in [\cite=ktt], because in cw-expansive dynamics there is not much information about the sets [formula], except that it is a totally disconnected set, and hence no local product structure should be expected a priori. also state the following questions: This question has not been answered yet, even for expansive homeomorphisms on manifolds.

Stable and unstable components

A point in a compact metric space X is called a weak sink or, equivalently, a Lyapunov stable point if [formula] is a neighborhood of x for each ε > 0. A weak sink x is a sink if, moreover, [formula], that is, if all points [formula] verify that [formula] when [formula]. Sources and weak sources are defined analogously. Let us mention that in the literature it is usually required that sinks be periodic, this notion is more general. that, in an expansive setting, weak sinks are sinks, and this fact still holds for cw-expansive homeomorphisms on Peano continua. A map f has sensitive dependence on initial conditions if there are no weak sinks on X.

In this section Theorem [\ref=piezas.conexas.cw] is proved. It is a standard fact that a non-wandering sink is periodic. Indeed, the proof follows as in an expansive setting for any compact X. We shall see that, moreover, weak sinks are always sinks and non-wandering in a Peano continuum. This, together with the fact that sinks form an open set, ends the proof of Theorem [\ref=no.sinks.cw]. [\ref=piezas.conexas.cw] follows by considering the connected component of the set Wsε,n(x) (see below) that is mapped into Bδ(fn(x)) by fn. This is a connected neighborhood of x that must meet the boundary of Wsε,n(x), for otherwise a source would appear in ω(x). below states that each continuum of diameter ε > 0 becomes α-distinguishable in at most [formula] forward or backward iterates, for some constant [formula] depending on f. This statement follows from compactness of X.

For all ε > 0 there exists [formula] such that [formula] for any continuum C satisfying [formula].

Let us define:

[formula]

We have, as an immediate corollary of Proposition [\ref=cw-uniform]:

For all x∈X and 0 < ε  <  α / 2 we have, if [formula], that:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula].

x is a sink ⇔   CWσα / 2(x) is a neighborhood of x.

Indeed, Cn = fn(CWsα / 2(x)) is a continuum satisfying [formula] for all [formula], hence [formula]. To see the less trivial inclusion ⊃   in Item [\ref=item3]., take [formula]. Then on one hand Dn  ⊂  CWsε,n(x), while, in view of Item [\ref=item1], [formula], so [formula]. that all statements in Corollary [\ref=corolario.cw.eps] hold in a general compactum X, except, in principle, ⇒   in Item [\ref=item4]. See Question [\ref=pregunta_conexion_local_pozos].

Let X be a Peano continuum and f a cw-expansive homeomorphism. Then the set S of sinks is an open set, and [formula] consists of periodic points.

Proof. Let x be a sink, and take a connected open neighborhood of x, U  ⊂  CWsα / 4(x). Then U consists of sinks. Indeed, triangular inequality implies U  ⊂  CWsα / 2(y) for all y∈U, hence from item [\ref=item4] in Corollary above, we get U consists of sinks. This shows the sets of sinks is open. now that x is non-wandering, and take M > Nα / 4 so that [formula]. But fM(CWsα / 2(x)) is contained, by Corollary above, in CWsα / 4(fM(x)), so choice of M implies that fM(CWsα / 2(x)) is in fact contained in CWsα / 2(x). Now, as [formula], we have [formula] must consist of only one (periodic) point. But there is at most one non-wandering point in CWsα / 2(x), hence x is periodic. [formula] The non existence of sinks will be proved by showing that all sinks are, in fact, non-wandering in the presence of local connectedness. We see that the basins of attraction of all sinks f- n(x) contain a ball of uniform radius. Being f- n(x) infinitely many would imply they "collapse", hence x would be, in fact, periodic by arguments in previous Proposition. Indeed, basins of attractions cannot shrink too much in the past, or else one would obtain a continuum not satisfying Proposition [\ref=cw-uniform].

In a Peano continuum X, all sinks are non-wandering, hence periodic.

Proof. There exist ρ > 0 and N  ≥  0 verifying [formula] for all n  ≥  N. Indeed, let ε > 0 be such that [formula], and consider ρ > 0 so that [formula] for all y∈X. Observe that Wsε,n(f- n(x))  ⊂  CWsα / 2(f- n(x)) for all [formula]. If we had [formula] for some [formula], then the continuum [formula] would satisfy [formula], hence [formula] for some [formula]. This would contradict Proposition [\ref=cw-uniform], since [formula] for all [formula]. So [formula] for all [formula], and the claim follows. γ > 0, take n > m > Nγ so that [formula]. Corollary [\ref=corolario.cw.eps].[\ref=item1] implies fn - m(x)∈CWsγ(x), and hence x∈ω(x). case X is a Peano continuum we obtain, by putting together Propositions [\ref=conjunto.weak.sinks.cw] and [\ref=pozo_no_errante], that, were the set of sinks not empty, there would be an open set of periodic points. In particular, there would be two different periodic points in the same basin of attraction. This proves Theorem [\ref=no.sinks.cw]. triviality of stable and unstable components follows now from this fact. However, sensitivity to initial conditions is not enough, in a general continuum, to guarantee that these components are nontrivial. Example in §[\ref=ejemplo.1] illustrates this. order to prove Theorem [\ref=piezas.conexas.cw], it will be seen that [formula] for all n  ≥  K. The proof follows then from the fact that CWsε,n(x) is a decreasing sequence converging to [formula]. [formula], where δ > 0 verifies [formula] for all y∈X. Observe that [formula] is not empty for all sufficiently large n > 0. Indeed, there exists [formula] such that [formula] for all n  ≥  K, for otherwise ω(x) would consist of sources. for all n  ≥  K there exists some 0  ≤  k  ≤  n such that [formula]. From this it follows that [formula] since, by choice of δ, [formula]; and by Proposition [\ref=cw-uniform] k∉[null]. Choice of δ again, implies [formula] is not empty. [formula]

Sufficient conditions in general compact sets

The following propositions are valid for a cw-expansive homeomorphism f of a compact metric space X.

If x is a sink such that α(x) contains a point of local connectedness, then x is periodic.

Proof. Let z =  lim kf- nk(x)∈α(x) be a point of local connectedness in α(x), and let us find ρ > 0 such that [formula] for all k. proof follows as in Proposition [\ref=pozo_no_errante], considering, for all [formula], the continuum [formula]. to next Proposition is the second example in §[\ref=ejemplo.1], which shows there can be an open set of points verifying [formula], even if X is a continuum.

For each ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that if ω(x) contains a point of local connectedness, then either x is a periodic source or [formula].

Let z =  lim kfnk(x) be a point of local connectedness of ω(x) and let δ > 0 be as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=piezas.conexas.cw]. If there is a subsequence such that [formula], then [formula] is not trivial. The proof is as in Theorem [\ref=piezas.conexas.cw]. Moreover, [formula]., z is a source verifying [formula]. Argument in Proposition [\ref=pozo_no_errante] shows z is periodic. Since z∈ω(x) there exists [formula]. Being z a source implies fn(x) = z. [formula]

Cw-expansive homeomorphisms on Peano curves

I thank R. Ures the suggestion of the following:

If X is a Peano continuum admitting a cw-expansive homeomorphism, then for each x∈X: [formula]. That is, X is nowhere rim-countable.

Proof. Let x∈X, 0 < ε  <  α / 4 and consider U a connected neighborhood of x such that U  ⊂  Bδ(x), where [formula]. Call [formula], and consider, for all z∈∂U the closed set [formula]. Bz has empty interior in the topology of s, due to cw-expansiveness. But [formula]. If ∂U were countable then s would be a countable union of closed sets with empty interior, which is absurd. [formula] As a consequence of this, we can also conclude:

If X is a Peano curve admitting a cw-expansive homeomorphism, then (1) All points in X belong to a continuum of convergence. (2) Every open set of X contains a simple closed curve. (3) The set of local cut points is at most countable. (4) X has a finite number of cyclic components.

(1) For any x0∈X and ε > 0, there is a sequence [formula], with [formula] such that [formula] is a pairwise disjoint collection. The Hausdorff limit of [formula] is a non trivial continuum containing x0. (2) The existence of a neighborhood basis {Kλ(x)} of a point x, such that each Kλ(x) is a dendrite, would imply x is a regular point, so each open set contains a close curve. Item (3) is implied by results in [\cite=w]. Item (4) is shown as in [\cite=ktt]. [formula]

Example

This is an example of an expansive dynamics in a continuum X, with sensitivity to the initial conditions, but not verifying the result stated in Theorem [\ref=piezas.conexas.cw]. In this example, moreover, there is an open subset O  ⊂  X such that all points in O verify that [formula]

Let us consider the following example, introduced in [\cite=rr]: Take a linear Anosov automorphism f on [formula], and choose a fixed point [formula]. Choose a stable and an unstable separatrix of p, say Ws+(p) and Wu+(p). Lift copies p̃, [formula], and [formula] of p, Ws+(p) and Wu+(p) respectively, in [formula], so that [formula] and [formula] be asymptotic to Wσ+(p), σ = s,u. Extending f continuously to this new set, gives an expansive homeomorphism F. Observe that F is an example of an expansive homeomorphism on a continuum, having sinks and sources, none of which is periodic. See Question [\ref=pregunta.sink.en.cuenca_de_periodico]. now any small perturbation of F at p̃, say G, so that there are no fixed points in [formula], and so that [formula] for all points in O. G is an expansive homeomorphism on a continuum with sensitive dependence on initial conditions; however, [formula] for all x in O.
