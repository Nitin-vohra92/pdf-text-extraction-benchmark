A varying-c cosmology

Introduction

The Standard Big Bang (SBB) model of the Universe is based on the cosmological principle, the Weyl postulate, and the general relativity [\cite=d'Inverno-1992]. It is the most successful model for describing the structure of the Universe. The coincidence between its predictions, for example, the abundance of the particles and the astronomical observations has put other models, such as the steady-state model, aside [\cite=Liddle-2003]. But, in spite of these abilities, the SBB is not a complete theory, as its initial conditions have weakened its strength. Some of these built-in assumptions are known as the horizon problem, the flatness problem, and the relic-particle abundance problem [\cite=Magueijo-1999].

To solve these problems, the idea of the inflationary Universe has been introduced [\cite=Guth-1981] [\cite=Linde-1982] [\cite=Linde-1983] [\cite=Kolb-Turner-1990]. It solves almost all the problems of the SBB, but until now, no universal acceptable microscopic foundation has been provided for this scenario [\cite=Albrecht-Magueijo-1999]. In addition, some new problems, for example, the quasi-flatness problem, have arisen [\cite=Barrow-Magueijo-1998] [\cite=Brandenberger-2001].

Apart from the problems described above, the interpretation of the recent observations, which claim that the Universe seems to be accelerating [\cite=Perlmutter-1997] [\cite=Garnavish-1998] [\cite=Schmidt-1998], shows that the SBB model has to be modified to include a Λ term [\cite=Wang-2000]. But, this amendment leads to another problem, that is, the probable incompatibility between quantum field theory and general relativity in estimating the vacuum energy density by an order even larger than 10120. This latter problem is called the Λ problem [\cite=Carroll-2000].

In the last decade, the Varying Speed-of-Light (VSL) models have been provided to solve the SBB problems as well [\cite=Albrecht-Magueijo-1999] [\cite=Barrow-Magueijo-1998] [\cite=Moffat-1993] [\cite=Clayton-Moffat-1998] [\cite=Barrow-1999] [\cite=Barrow-Magueijo-1999] [\cite=Albrecht-1999] [\cite=Clayton-Moffat-2000] [\cite=Magueijo-2000] [\cite=Youm-2001] [\cite=Basset-2000]. Although it seems that these models can be viewed as alternatives to the inflationary scenario, non constructive structures and new problems have debarred them from acceptance until now. For a review of these kinds of theories and their shortcomings, see, for example, ref. [\cite=Magueijo-2003] and references therein.

One of the crucial criticism against varying-c theories is that the Lorentz invariance may break down, therefore, the special relativity should be adjusted. However, in the literature [\cite=Jafari-Shariati-2003], people claim that the Fock-Lorentz [\cite=Fock-1964] [\cite=Manida-1999] and the Magueijo-Smolin [\cite=Magueijo-Smolin-2002] [\cite=Magueijo-Smolin-2003] transformations, which can be regarded as examples of the VSL theories, are only re-descriptions of the special relativity, and hence, the Lorentz invariance can be preserved. Also, according to textbooks, for example, ref. [\cite=Rindler-1979], besides the Euclidicity and the isotropy assumptions, the first principle of the special relativity, namely, the relativity principle, leads solely to either Galilean or Lorentz transformations. In the latter transformation, there is an upper local limit for speed of particles. The semistrong principle of equivalence permits the possibility of different numerical contents, namely, different values of the fundamental constants, at different parts of space-time in the Universe. Hence, the global laws, whose local approximations are considered in the various local space-time regions, probably involve the derivatives of these constants [\cite=Rindler-1979].

Until now, there is no theory of physics that has determined the values of fundamental physical constants. Even more, none has specified wether these constants are true constants or not. Practically, these constants may be regarded as initial values in theories. It is worth noting that there are two different kinds of physical constants. The first group are constants that are related to phenomena or quantities. The second group are those that appear as coefficients in relations. Examples of the first group are c, as the speed of light (a quantity) or c, as the ultimate speed of all material particles (a phenomenon), and e the electric charge unit. On the other hand, G, the gravitational constant, and H, the Hubble parameter, are examples of the second group. Although the values of constants in both groups strictly depend on the choice of units, but dimensionless ratios of constants of the first group should rather be determined from their theories themselves.

It is plausible to assume that cosmological laws are global laws and conventional physical laws are special (local) cases of them. Also, these global laws would probably be simple in essence and format, and the complexities of our present laws (if any) are perhaps caused by limitations that localities have forced on them. An optimistic and simple insight is that, generalizations of the physical laws of today may lead to cosmological laws. Implicitly, as the Universe can be regarded as a collection of statistical quantities, a numerical analysis of the ratios of these quantities would be meaningful even though there is a lack of any reasonable theory to explain them, for example, the large-numbers hypothesis [\cite=Dirac-1937], though some people believe that the Dirac large-numbers hypothesis has some cracks in. Therefore, it seems acceptable that a cosmological model depends more on symmetries than on initial conditions.

Inspired by the above discussions and some postulates presented in ref. [\cite=Albrecht-Magueijo-1999], a simple varying-c cosmological model is provided in this work, though it differs somehow from the former ones in that it does not solve cosmological problems only. That is, it is based on a few cosmologically plausible assumptions through inertial arguments, to be described in the next section, in addition to the assumption that the speed of light is not a constant. Other differences will be obvious through the work and also, we emphasis a few key distinctions in the conclusion. Although, the authors never claim that it is a complete model, to show its abilities, solutions to some typical problems are given.

In Section [\ref=Basic0], basic concepts of our model are introduced. Two fundamental assumptions and the concepts behind them are determined, and then variations of the essential quantities with respect to the scale factor are derived. In Section [\ref=Field0], the Robertson-Walker metric and the Einstein equation are discussed and hence the Friedman and field equations are obtained. Also, the time dependency of quantities in the former section are derived. The age of the Universe is calculated in terms of the Hubble constant. Section [\ref=Problem0] provides solutions to some famous problems such as the horizon, the accelerating Universe, the flatness, and the quasi-flatness problems.

Basic concepts

Before proceeding, let us specify the frame work and the metric that we are going to use. The cosmological principle, i.e., the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of the Universe, implies that there should be no preferred point in the Universe. This is obtained when the spatial part of the metric has a constant curvature. The Robertson-Walker metric is the most general metric that merits these properties even if c0 is replaced by c(t), i.e.,

[formula]

Rewriting ([\ref=Field29]) as

[formula]

shows that the metric ([\ref=Field29]) is conformal to the original one, i.e., the metric ([\ref=Field29]) where c(t) is replaced by c0. That is, the causal structures of these metrics are the same. The components of this metric are

[formula]

Note that g00 is the coefficient of [formula] and not dt. (In a similar way, one can introduce another coefficient, c'(t), in the relation x0 = c'(t)t, where in this model due to the later relation ([\ref=Field23]), [formula].) This guarantees that all functions (including the components of the tensors in the general relativity) derived from this metric are identical with those derived from the usual metric with constant-c but now with dx0 instead of dt. The only task to do, when someone wants to show the time dependency of the functions, is to replace ∂x0 by c(t)∂t in the relations. In the rest of this manuscript, all arguments are hold in the Robertson-Walker framework as the comoving (preferred) frame of cosmology.

On the other hand, one may also prefer to write ([\ref=Field29]) in another coordinate, such as c(t)2dt2 = c20dt'2, and hence to get

[formula]

That is, in terms of this new time, t', the metric is reduced to the standard Robertson-Walker metric. This may bring ambiguities about which metric is physical. As mentioned before, the metric ([\ref=Field29]) is conformal with the standard Robertson-Walker metric and so one cannot distinguish which metric is the real physical one.

In a cosmological model, it is constructive to specify whether the mass-energy conservation law holds or not. Although some few models are based upon the idea of changing-M, for example, the steady-state theory, in most theories, it has been accepted that the whole mass M of the (observable) Universe is a constant. While the speed of light is supposed to be a constant, there is no difference between the constancy of the total mass M and the total energy Mc2 of the (observable) Universe, but with varying-c, for example, in the VSL theories, one should strictly decide about the constancy of the mass and the energy content of the Universe separately. Hence, in the preferred frame of the cosmology, we begin with the following two key assumptions that are related directly to the above facts

i.e., the energy conservation law is valid.

where R is the radius of the (observable) Universe. In other words, the inertial energy of a particle is due to the gravitation potential energy of the mass content of the Universe upon it.

These two assumptions have old analogous backgrounds, for the first one, it is what has been accepted in most theories, however, here without a limitation rule that force the speed of light, c, to be a constant. Hence, in general, both M and c can be assumed to be functions of coordinates, in addition, to the homogeneity assumption, in the preferred frame of the cosmology, it is plausible to assume that M and c depend on the cosmological time only. The second relation, which points out that the inertial energy of a particle is compensated for by the negative gravitational potential energy due to the interaction with all matter of the Universe, is indeed a mathematical formulation of the Machian view about the inertial energy of a particle. Hence, particles may be created without violation of the energy conservation law. Also it should be noted that, in ([\ref=Basic1]), m can be canceled out, and hence one can write this relation in the cosmological preferred frame instead of going to the rest frame of the particle.

One may feel that the foundation of these assumptions is unsatisfactory, for one may argue that these are notions of weak-field gravity such as the Newtonian potential energy used in the context of the large-scale gravitational field. However, one should note that even the Friedmann equations can be obtained from the Newtonian approach. Besides, constructing an energy quantity by dimensional analysis using cosmological parameters such as M, R, and G, one can gain the Newtonian potential energy in its simplest form. Moreover, to proceed experimental data, one should use these usual notions. Indeed, these justifications are not the first goal of researchers into varying-c models, but its consequences. In other words, this is a simple model only, and its subsequent results and discussions will prove it.

Although one can think of G as a variable, a simple case for a global theory may be provided with G independent of time. In this work, the authors assume it to be a constant, but to have M, the total mass of the Universe, as a varying parameter. That is, the probable variation of G that appeared in the other models is ascribed to varying M in this model. In this sense, the Newtonian gravitational potential for a fixed-mass particle at a fixed distance does not depend on (cosmological) time.

Adding up ([\ref=Basic1]) for all particles in the Universe, one gets

[formula]

where one can substitute [formula] with M. Consequently it gives

[formula]

which determines the value of Mc2 in ([\ref=Basic2]). It also reduces to

[formula]

Obviously, as mentioned earlier, canceling m in ([\ref=Basic1]) gives ([\ref=Basic3]) and ([\ref=Basic19]). The order of the last relation can be obtained separately by constructing a dimensionless relation from the fundamental cosmological parameters, as mentioned in the famous paper by Brans-Dicke [\cite=Brans-Dicke-1961] and with a somewhat different notation in Sciama's paper [\cite=Sciama-1953]. By considering ([\ref=Basic19]) and following some authors who use [formula] for comparing the gravity intensities of the celestial objects, one can think of the Universe as twice as strong as black holes. This will be discussed in more details in a later work. Rearranging ([\ref=Basic19]) results in

[formula]

The numerator of the left-hand side of ([\ref=Basic4]) is a constant by our assumptions, hence differentiating ([\ref=Basic4]) with respect to the cosmological time, t, gives

[formula]

If one now defines the scale factor a as usual, and assumes that [formula], ([\ref=Basic5]) leads to

[formula]

Integrating ([\ref=Basic6]) yields

[formula]

where by c0 and a0, we mean the current values of these quantities. Defining the redshift, [formula] as usual, one finds from ([\ref=Basic7]) that

[formula]

Following the same procedure used in deriving ([\ref=Basic7]), one can get

[formula]

To determine the relationship between the wavelength λ and the scale factor a, using the usual method, one has for two light rays with a time interval dt between two points that

[formula]

where te and tr are the time of emission and reception, respectively. Substituting λ = cdt in the above relation yields

[formula]

as usual. Another way to derive a relation for λ is to suppose a stationary wave between two points. For this wave to remain stationary during the evolution of a non static Universe, one gains again the relation ([\ref=Basic11]). Using f = c / λ for the frequency, and ([\ref=Basic7]) and ([\ref=Basic11]), implies that

[formula]

A question arises when one compares ([\ref=Basic11]) and ([\ref=Basic12]): which one corresponds to the redshift that one detects, the wavelength or the frequency? The answer is the frequency, for all the astronomical observation tools are sensitive to frequency, i.e., the number of the peaks that one receives in a unit time. Naturally, knowing the speed of light, one can claim that one measures the wavelength of the light simultaneously. Hence, a useful relation for the redshift is

[formula]

where fe and fr are the frequency at the time of emission where a = az, and the time of reception where a = a0, respectively. This relation shows that the frequency displacement in the spectrum of a cosmological object corresponds to a newer epoch than the other models expect, for example, for [formula], the relations implies that the corresponding object lies at z = 0.74 when the Universe had a radius 57% smaller than it is nowadays, while other theories predict these values as z = 1 and [formula]. It is evident that for a nearer object, this effect is more negligible.

Now let us have a look at the energy density distribution of the black-body radiation, i.e.,

[formula]

The left-hand side of ([\ref=Basic17]), the energy density, should vary as a- 3, and so the right-hand side should do the same. The fraction (f / c)3 on the right-hand side, which by ([\ref=Basic7]) and ([\ref=Basic12]) evolves proportionally with a- 3, guarantees this condition. The simplest choice for the exponential function in the denominator to preserve the behavior of the distribution is to assume

[formula]

or consequently

[formula]

In deriving ([\ref=Basic16]), we have assumed that the Planck's constant, [formula], and the Boltzmann constant, kB, plausibly to be constants.

Also some calculations using ([\ref=Basic2]) and ([\ref=Basic8]) imply that

[formula]

So one can write the relationship between ρ and a as

[formula]

in spite of the matter content and any epoch of the Universe. Here, only the gravitational effects of the density ρ are considered. In general, the density includes the ordinary matter, the radiation, dark matter, dark energy, and any other forms of particles. For those who are uncomfortable with this result, one can write the familiar form

[formula]

which is provided for the matter-dominated epoch of the Universe (i.e., dust) in the famous models. However, one should remember that in this situation, regardless of the types of the content of the Universe, it (or at least the dominated part of it) has to obey ([\ref=Basic15]) and ([\ref=Basic18]).

The introduction of varying-c forces one to rethink some of the standard lore of cosmology. As this model does not allow an earlier radiation-dominated stage of the Universe, it may be better to clear up how the observed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) would arise, or to what extent nucleosynthesis would be allowed to occur. However, at first glance, one should note that the origin of CMB was when electrons were bounded in atoms. It can occur regardless of the stage of the Universe. The nucleosynthesis seems to be rearranged.

The field equation

The Einstein field equation is a well-constructed theory that can be considered even if the fundamental constants are not really constants, i.e. the relation [formula] generally implies that geometry and matter affect each other (independent of the frame of reference). Due to the correspondence principle, one can derive the full equation as

[formula]

Also the definition of the metric components ([\ref=Field33]) is compatible with the Bianchi identity, i.e.,

[formula]

Assuming a varying-c model and the correspondence principle, if one tries to use the Einstein equation as a field equation in the cosmological frame, at least some points should be noted. Relation ([\ref=Basic7]) implies that the coefficient of the Einstein equation is also varying with time, i.e.,

[formula]

where κ = 8πG / c4. This means that the coefficient of the Einstein equation varies proportionally to the scale factor, so the coupling between geometry and matter, becomes stronger as the Universe expands. Conversely, for the case when a  →  0 obviously κ  →  0. By applying the covariant divergence to both sides of the Einstein equation using ([\ref=Field34]), it turns out that

[formula]

and hence, one can not get the canonical energy-momentum conservation relation, [formula]. A crucial task in this approach remains to provide a Lagrangian formulation for ([\ref=Field12]), though, it is obvious that such a variation must provide the whole argument of ([\ref=Field2]), i.e., [formula]. In other words, the standard definition of the energy-momentum tensor needs to be modified to consider variations in c, for example, a change in c should act as a source of matter. To keep the usual definition of the energy-momentum tensor, one may add other term(s) to Tab. This is the aim of another work of the authors [\cite=Shojaie-Farhoudi-2004-2].

As one works with the Robertson-Walker metric in the cosmological frame, where c is assumed to be a function of the cosmological time only, ([\ref=Field2]) yields

[formula]

Assuming Tab to be a perfect fluid, i.e.,

[formula]

where ua = (c,0,0,0) in the co-moving frame, the spatial equations of ([\ref=Field3]) are identically zero. The time equation derived from ([\ref=Field3]) by using p = (γ - 1)ρc2, reduces to

[formula]

where [formula] and ε  =  ρc2. Equation ([\ref=Field4]) can be treated as the field equation. Simplifying the above equation using the relation ([\ref=Basic7]) leads to

[formula]

Comparing ([\ref=Field5]) and ([\ref=Basic15]) with each other, yields

[formula]

i.e., a fixed γ that always gives [formula]. Therefore, the Universe has a negative pressure all the time, and there is no such dust- or radiation-dominated epochs.

Using the Robertson-Walker metric in the Einstein equation and substituting c∂t instead of ∂x0 leads to an analogy of the Friedman equations, i.e.,

[formula]

and

[formula]

As can be easily seen, the term [formula] is the only difference between these equations in this case and the usual classical ones. One can also check that combining these two relations and removing the [formula] phrase gives ([\ref=Field5]) again. By substituting ([\ref=Field10]) in the latter, one gains

[formula]

Using ([\ref=Basic7]) and p = (γ - 1)ρc2 in the last relation, it yields

[formula]

Now by applying ([\ref=Field14]) in the above, one can write the second Friedmann equation simply as

[formula]

We will return to this equation later.

Now, to solve the Friedmann equations, one should substitute ([\ref=Basic7]) and ([\ref=Basic15]) in ([\ref=Field10]), hence it gives

[formula]

where H0 is the value of the Hubble parameter [formula] at the current time, t0. Taking the square root of the above relation and noting that the negative sign has no meaning, (for in this case it gives H0 =  - H0!), one has

[formula]

Integrates ([\ref=Field18]) and setting a = 0 for t = 0, i.e., the Universe has begun from a big bang, one gets

[formula]

where

[formula]

It is worth noting that the differential equation ([\ref=Field18]), because of the plausible assumption that [formula], always leads to a big bang.

From the best measurements, the Hubble constant is

[formula]

One should note that the methods of measuring H0 may be affected by varying-c in this model, for example, corrections in measuring the redshift as mentioned before. Hence, the value of the Hubble constant may differ from its predicted range. In spite of the above argument, using the data of ([\ref=Field21]) in ([\ref=Field20]) gives the age of the Universe to as

[formula]

which is a better approximation than the current values from the most accepted models. Note that ([\ref=Field13]) implies that [formula] never changes sign even if k  ≠  0, for [formula] to become zero, a should tend to infinity. The only acceptable choice is [formula], i.e., the Universe expands forever and

[formula]

in spite of the sign of k. In agreement with the above conclusion, one can rewrite ([\ref=Field24]) as

[formula]

The above relation indicates that the Universe always decelerates during its life independent of its topology and that this deceleration rate can be explained completely by the Hubble parameter. Note that even with k =  + 1, one gets an ever-expanding Universe with a closed topology. As it can obviously be seen, the deceleration parameter [formula], is always

[formula]

From ([\ref=Field26]), one gets

[formula]

Hence, ([\ref=Field17]) and ([\ref=Field27]) imply that no Big Crunch will be visited even with a positive curved space-time.

The relations ([\ref=Basic7]) and ([\ref=Field19]) give

[formula]

with the limits

[formula]

Also ([\ref=Basic15]) and ([\ref=Field19]) yield

[formula]

where one has

[formula]

which implies at t = 0, one still meets the singularity. Also combining ([\ref=Basic21]) and ([\ref=Field19]) yields

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

i.e., this model is also a hot big bang model.

Solving some problems

One of the most important reason for defining a new cosmological model is to be able to solve the problems of the other models. In this section, we are going to provide some solutions to the problems mainly encountered with SBB, for the model introduced in this work has a big bang as well.

The horizon problem

The horizon problem implies that because of the limited speed of light, all the regions of (at least) the (observed) Universe can not be in contact until the time of observation. So the different parts of the Universe may behave in different ways. The observations disagree with this idea. To solve this problem in this model, one should notice that the speed of light had no upper limit on it, i.e.,

[formula]

Mathematically speaking, one can calculate the particle horizon

[formula]

which is clearly infinite, i.e., all the regions of the Universe are observable. As one can claim that this argument is valid for any position and any time in the Universe, this means that all the regions of the Universe are causally connected.

The flatness and quasi-flatness problem

The first Friedmann equation ([\ref=Field10]) shows that in this model the critical density, ρc, which corresponds to the flat space-time, is as usual

[formula]

Defining [formula] and rewriting ([\ref=Field10]) for [formula] gives

[formula]

which implies that in the SBB model the right-hand side of the above equation is proportional to the positive power law of t. Consequently, for Ω to be nearly flat, which observations confirm, it should be finely tuned to the one in the very early epoch of the Universe. This is known as the flatness problem.

However, in this model, using [formula], [formula] and [formula], one has

[formula]

This means that Ω is not time-dependent at all and its value does not vary during the life of the Universe. Also, the last relation does not force the geometry to be exactly flat, which solves the quasi-flatness problem as well. This problem arises as the Universe does not seem to be perfectly flat. It will be shown that the most probable value of Ω in this model is less than unity [\cite=Shojaie-Farhoudi-2004-2].

To see the effect of the curvature, k, on the acceleration, [formula], substitute ([\ref=Field10]) into ([\ref=Field24]), it gives

[formula]

The first term on the right-hand side of the above equation is a negative term in power of t- 2. The second term is also a term in the power of t- 2, whose sign depends on k. Hence, surprisingly, when k is positive the Universe decelerates with a rate less than that for the flat case, and conversely the rate of deceleration is more than that of the flat case when k is negative. As can easily be checked, this special property arises from varying-c, i.e., the extra term [formula] in ([\ref=Field11]) holds the Universe near flat geometry.

Curvature domination problem

In SBB, one may worry about the curvature domination, i.e., for a large enough a, the curvature term in ([\ref=Field10]) dominates. In this model, as discussed above, the curvature and the density terms have the same order of t and a, hence, if the curvature could not dominate in an epoch, obviously it cannot do later.

Relic-particle problem

The density of the massive particles decreases as

[formula]

Hence, in the early epoch of the Universe, these massive particles should have dominated over the radiation in the SBB model. Nowadays, we have no evidence of observing these massive particles. This is known as the relic-particle problem and sometimes is referred to as the magnetic monopole problem, as one of the first known massive particles was the magnetic monopole. However, in this model the density of the Universe, including any combinations of different kinds of matter and (or) energy, decreases with a lower power of a as

[formula]

This shows that the above problem does not occur in this model.

The accelerating Universe

Recently, analysis of the luminosity of the supernovae at redshift [formula] shows that they are fainter than expected [\cite=Perlmutter-1997] [\cite=Garnavish-1998] [\cite=Schmidt-1998]. Hence, it has been suggested that the Universe may experience a period of acceleration. In our model, the Universe always decelerates. So, how can one explain this situation?

The key solution is located in the dependency of the flux density, S, of the celestial objects to the redshift, z. That is, the results of these observational data would be due to different relations for the redshift of objects. Despite the SBB model where [formula], in this model, one has

[formula]

for the photons arriving from those objects and they have frequencies (and obviously energies) proportional to [formula], see ([\ref=Basic20]). Hence, for a particular redshift z, a cosmological object in this model has [formula] times the flux density calculated by the SBB model, for example, the supernovae with z = 1 should be found to be fainter by a factor of approximately 29%. As a result, this analyzing should be revised and we expect there should be no need to assume an accelerating Universe.

The source of inertia

Relation ([\ref=Basic8]) implies that

[formula]

It means that the Universe began from a big bang, a = 0, when it was empty. By assuming ([\ref=Basic2]), the decreasing-c makes the total mass of the Universe increase. Hence, one may speculate that the light should act as a source of inertia due to its reduction in speed. We are not going to provide a mechanism for this phenomenon, however, the idea of matter creation has been employed in other cosmological models, for example Hoyle-Narlikar and steady-state models [\cite=Narlikar-2002], but with a constant c.

Conclusion

We have constructed a new model for the Universe with two key assumptions written in the preferred frame of cosmology: (i) inertial energy of the Universe, Mc2, is a constant, and (ii) the total energy of a particle, i.e., its inertial energy plus its gravitational potential energy, is zero. The second assumption is another version of the Machian view. In addition, we do not restrict the speed of light to a constant, however, we assume that G is a constant. These and some other plausible assumptions lead to the relations between the scale factor and the speed of light, the total mass and the density of the Universe. Also the relations between the wavelength and the frequency of light and the scale factor are obtained. This suggests that corrections to the redshift measurements should be made.

The Robertson-Walker metric and the Einstein equation compatible with varying-c are used. However, the result is [formula], which with the assumption of perfect fluids it consequently fixes γ at 2 / 3. This means that there are no dust- or radiation-dominated epochs, and [formula].

The generalized Friedmann equations yield the following properties for the Universe in this model.

It began from a hot big bang when it was empty, i.e., M = 0 when t = 0.

It expands forever regardless of the sign of the curvature.

It always decelerates. The deceleration parameter is fixed to [formula].

Its age lies approximately in the range [formula] years.

The speed of light varies with the cosmological time as [formula].

The total mass, the density and the temperature of the Universe vary with the cosmological time as [formula], [formula] and [formula], respectively.

The horizon, the flatness, the curvature domination, and the relic-particle problems of the standard big-bang (SBB) are solved. Besides, the flux density of celestial objects in this model is lower than that derived from the SBB model, i.e., these objects look fainter than the SBB expectation.

In addition, a reduction of c can be contemplated as a source of matter creation. That is, in this model, in contrast to some other models, for example Ref. [\cite=Albrecht-Magueijo-1999], the geometry of the Universe is affected by varying-c.
