Introduction

We begin with the following situation in linear algebra. Let F denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension. By a linear transformation on V, we mean a F-linear map from V to V. Let A denote a linear transformation on V. By an eigenspace of A, we mean a nonzero subspace of V of the form

[formula]

where θ∈F. We say A is diagonalizable on V whenever V is spanned by the eigenspaces of A.

Let F denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension. By a Tridiagonal pair (or TD pair) on V, we mean an ordered pair (A,A*), where A and A* are linear transformations on V that satisfy the following four conditions.

A and A* are both diagonalizable on V.

There exists an ordering [formula] of the eigenspaces of A such that

[formula]

where V- 1  =  0, Vd + 1  =  0.

There exists an ordering [formula] of the eigenspaces of A* such that

[formula]

where V*- 1  =  0, V*δ + 1  =  0.

There is no subspace W of V such that both AW  ⊆  W, A*W  ⊆  W, other than W = 0 and W = V.

According to a common notational convention, for a linear transformation A the conjugate-transpose of A is denoted A*. We emphasize we are not using this convention. In a TD pair (A,A*), the linear transformations A and A* are arbitrary subject to (i)-(iv) above.

Let (A,A*) denote a TD pair on V. Then (A*,A) is a TD pair on V, which we refer to as the dual of (A,A*).

We now consider some examples of TD pairs. Our first example is from the theory of association schemes.

Referring to [\cite=TersubI], [\cite=TersubII], [\cite=TersubIII], let Y denote a symmetric association scheme, with vertex set X. Assume Y is P-polynomial with respect to an associate matrix A, and Q-polynomial with respect to a primitive idempotent E. Let [formula] denote the I   C-algebra consisting of all matrices with rows and columns indexed by X, and entries in I   C. Fix a vertex x∈X, and let A*  =  A*(x) denote the diagonal matrix in [formula] with diagonal entries

[formula]

Let T denote the subalgebra of [formula] generated by A and A*, and let V denote an irreducible T-module. Then the restrictions A|V, A*|V form TD pair on V.

This is immediate from [\cite=TersubI].

The above example inspired our definition of a TD pair, and motivates all that we do in the present paper.

Our next example of a TD pair comes from Lie algebra.

Let F denote an algebraically closed field with characteristic 0, and let L denote the Lie algebra sl2(F). Let A and A* denote semi-simple elements in L, and assume L is generated by these elements. Let V denote a finite dimensional irreducible L-module. Then A and A* act on V as a TD pair.

We claim L has a basis e,f,h such that A is a nonzero scalar multiple of h, and such that

[formula]

where [  ,  ] denotes the Lie bracket. To see this, we identify L with the Lie algebra sl(W), where W is a two dimensional vector space over F. Recall sl(W) is the vector space over F consisting of all linear transformations on W that have trace 0, together with Lie bracket [x,y]  =  xy - yx. Since A is semisimple, W has a basis u,v consisting of eigenvectors for A. Let r denote the eigenvalue of A associated with u. Since A has trace 0 on W, we find the eigenvalue of A associated with v is - r. Observe [formula]; otherwise A = 0, contradicting our assumption that A and A* generate L. Set h = r- 1A. Let e (resp. f) denote the linear transformation on W satisfying ev = u and eu = 0 (resp. fu = v and fv = 0). Observe e and f have trace 0, so they are contained in L. One readily finds e,f,h are linearly independent, and that L has dimension 3, so e,f,h form a basis for L. From the construction, we readily obtain ([\ref=eq:sl2rel]), and our claim is proved. Using ([\ref=eq:sl2rel]), we routinely find the L-module V has a basis [formula] satisfying

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq:honV]) we find h (and A) is diagonalizable on V. Let Vi denote the span of vi, for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d. Then [formula] is an ordering of the maximal eigenspaces of A. By ([\ref=eq:honV])-([\ref=eq:eonV]), and since A* is a linear combination of e,f,h, we obtain ([\ref=eq:astaractionthreeint]). We now have Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp](ii). Interchanging the roles of A and A* in the above argument, we find A* is diagonalizable on V, and that Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp](iii) holds. Since A,A* generate L, and since V is irreducible as an L module, we obtain Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp](iv). We have now shown (A,A*) satisfies the conditions of Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp], so (A,A*) is a TD pair on V.

Inspired by the previous example, we make the following definition. Let (A,A*) denote a TD pair. We say (A,A*) is thin whenever the eigenspaces of both A and A* all have dimension 1. In [\cite=LS99], the thin TD pairs are called Leonard pairs, and a complete classification of these objects is given.

Here is another example of a TD pair.

Let F denote an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, and let V denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension. Let A and A* denote linear transformations on V satisfying (i)-(ii) below.

There exists nonzero scalars b,b*∈F such that

[formula]

where [r,s] means rs - sr.

There is no subspace W of V such that both AW  ⊆  W, A*W  ⊆  W, other than W = 0 and W = V.

Then (A,A*) is a TD pair on V.

For all θ∈F, we define

[formula]

Observe V(θ) is nonzero if and only if θ is an eigenvalue of A, and in this case V(θ) is the corresponding maximal eigenspace. We claim

[formula]

To see ([\ref=eq:deltaexchange]), let θ be given, and pick any v∈V(θ). Expanding ([\ref=eq:DG1]), we obtain

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=eq:deltadefexpand]) to v, and using Av = θv, we obtain

[formula]

The scalars θ - b,θ,θ  +  b are distinct, so apparently

[formula]

and ([\ref=eq:deltaexchange]) follows. Since F is algebraically closed, all the eigenvalues of A are contained in F. Since V has finite positive dimension, A has at least one eigenvalue θ. Since F has characteristic zero, the scalars [formula] are mutually distinct, so they cannot all be eigenvalues of A; consequently there exists an eigenvalue a for A such that a - b is not an eigenvalue of A. Similarily the scalars [formula] are mutually distinct, so they cannot all be eigenvalues of A; consequently there exists a nonnegative integer d such that a + bi is an eigenvalue of A for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, but not for i = d + 1. Let us abbreviate Vi  =  V(a + bi) for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d. Then

[formula]

is nonzero and A-invariant by construction. From ([\ref=eq:deltaexchange]) and the construction, we find

[formula]

where V- 1 = 0, Vd + 1 = 0. In particular, ([\ref=eq:sumwillbeV]) is A*-invariant. Applying assumption (ii), we find the sum ([\ref=eq:sumwillbeV]) equals V. Now apparently A is diagonalizable on V, and Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp](ii) holds. Interchanging the roles of A and A* in the above argument, we find A* is diagonalizable on V, and Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp](iii) holds. Observe Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp](iv) is just assumption (ii) above. We have now shown (A,A*) satisfy the conditions of Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp], so it is a TD pair on V.

The equations ([\ref=eq:DG1]), ([\ref=eq:DG2]) are known as the Dolan-Grady relations [\cite=DateRoan], [\cite=Dav], [\cite=Dolgra], [\cite=Roanmpi], [\cite=Ugl] and are important in Statistical Mechanics. The Lie algebra over I   C generated by two symbols A,A* subject to ([\ref=eq:DG1]), ([\ref=eq:DG2]) (where we interpret [  ,  ] as the Lie bracket) is infinite dimensional and is known as the Onsager algebra [\cite=CKOns], [\cite=Dav], [\cite=Per], [\cite=Roanmpi], [\cite=Ugl].

The next example is a kind of q-analog of the previous one.

Let F denote an algebraically closed field, and let q denote a nonzero element in F that is not a root of unity. Let V denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension, and let A and A* denote linear transformations on V satisfying (i), (ii) below.

A and A* are not nilpotent, and

[formula]

where [r,s] means rs - sr.

There is no subspace W of V such that both AW  ⊆  W, A*W  ⊆  W, other than W = 0 and W = V.

Then (A,A*) is a TD pair on V.

The proof is similar to that of Example [\ref=def:onsager]. For all θ∈F, we define

[formula]

We claim that for all nonzero θ∈F,

[formula]

To see ([\ref=eq:deltaexchangeserre]), let θ be given, and pick any v∈V(θ). Expanding the relation ([\ref=eq:Serre1]), we find

[formula]

Applying each term in ([\ref=eq:deltaserre2]) to v, and using Av = θv, we routinely find

[formula]

We assume [formula] and that q is not a root of unity, so q- 1θ,θ,qθ are distinct. Now apparently

[formula]

and ([\ref=eq:deltaexchangeserre]) follows. Since F is algebraically closed, all the eigenvalues of A are contained in F. Since V has finite positive dimension, and since A is not nilpotent, A has at least one nonzero eigenvalue θ. Since q is not a root of unity, the scalars [formula] are mutually distinct, so they cannot all be eigenvalues of A; consequently there exists an eigenvalue a for A such that q- 1a is not an eigenvalue of A. Similarily the scalars [formula] are mutually distinct, so they cannot all be eigenvalues of A; consequently there exists a nonnegative integer d such that aqi is an eigenvalue of A for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, but not for i = d + 1. Let us abbreviate Vi = V(aqi) for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d. Then

[formula]

is nonzero and A-invariant by construction. By ([\ref=eq:deltaexchangeserre]) and the construction, we find

[formula]

where V- 1 = 0, Vd + 1 = 0. In particular, ([\ref=eq:sumwillbeVserre]) is A*-invariant. Applying assumption (ii) above, we find the sum ([\ref=eq:sumwillbeVserre]) equals V. Now apparently A is diagonalizable on V, and Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp](ii) holds. Interchanging the roles of A and A* in the above argument, we find A* is diagonalizable on V, and Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp](iii) holds. Observe Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp](iv) is just assumption (ii) above. We have now shown (A,A*) satisfy the conditions of Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp], so it is a TD pair on V.

The relations ([\ref=eq:Serre1]), ([\ref=eq:Serre2]) are known as quantum Serre relations. They are among the defining relations for the quantum affine algebra [formula], where r2 = q. See [\cite=CPqaa], [\cite=CPqaar] for more information about this algebra.

TD systems

When working with a TD pair, it is often convenient to consider a closely related but somewhat more abstract concept, called a TD system. To define it, we recall a few concepts from linear algebra. Let V denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension, and let [formula] denote the F-algebra consisting of all linear transformations on V. let A denote a diagonalizable element in [formula]. Let [formula] denote an ordering of the eigenvalues of A, and put

[formula]

for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d. By elementary linear algebra,

[formula]

From this, one finds [formula] is a basis for the subalgebra of [formula] generated by A. We refer to Ei as the primitive idempotent of A associated with θi. It is helpful to think of these primitive idempotents as follows. From ([\ref=eq:primid2S99]), ([\ref=eq:primid3S99]) one readily finds

[formula]

For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, EiV is the eigenspace of A associated with the eigenvalue θi, and Ei is the projection of V onto this eigenspace.

Let F denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension. By a Tridiagonal system (or TD system) on V, we mean a sequence

[formula]

that satisfies (i)-(vi) below.

A,   A*   are both diagonalizable linear transformations on V.

[formula] is an ordering of the primitive idempotents of   A.

[formula] is an ordering of the primitive idempotents of   A*.

[formula].

[formula]

There is no subspace W of V such that both AW  ⊆  W, A*W  ⊆  W, other than W = 0 and W = V.

We refer to d as the diameter of Φ, and say Φ is over F. For notational convenience, we set E- 1 = 0, Ed + 1 = 0, E*- 1 = 0, E*δ + 1 = 0.

Referring to Definition [\ref=def:deflstalkS99], we do not assume the primitive idempotents of A and A* all have rank 1. A TD system for which these primitive idempotents all have rank 1 is called a Leonard system [\cite=LS99]. The Leonard systems are completely classified by Terwilliger [\cite=LS99].

In the next two lemmas, we give the connection between TD pairs and TD systems.

Let F denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension. Let (A,A*) denote a TD pair on V. Let [formula] denote an ordering of the eigenspaces of A satisfying ([\ref=eq:astaractionthreeint]), and for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d let Ei denote the projection of V onto Vi. Let [formula] denote an ordering of the eigenspaces of A* satisfying ([\ref=eq:aactionthreeint]), and for 0  ≤  i  ≤  δ let E*i denote the projection of V onto V*i. Then

[formula]

is a TD system on V.

We verify the conditions (i)-(vi) of Definition [\ref=def:deflstalkS99]. Condition (i) is just Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp](i). Conditions (ii) and (iii) follow from the comment after ([\ref=eq:VdecompS99]). To obtain condition (iv), pick any integers i,j (0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d), and assume |i - j| > 1. For all v∈V,

[formula]

so EiA*Ej = 0. We have now verified condition (iv), and condition (v) is similarily obtained. Condition (vi) is just Definition [\ref=def:nonthinlp](iv).

Let F denote a field, let V denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension, and let

[formula]

denote a TD sytem on V. Then

[formula]

Moreover, (A,A*) is a TD pair on V. We refer to (A,A*) as the TD pair associated with Φ.

To obtain ([\ref=eq:asspread]), observe by ([\ref=eq:primid3S99]) and Definition [\ref=def:deflstalkS99](iv) that

[formula]

Line ([\ref=eq:aspread]) is similarily obtained, and the last assertion follows.

We finish this section with an observation.

Referring to the TD system ([\ref=eq:ourstartingpt]), we have

[formula],

[formula]

(i) Pick any integer i (1  ≤  i  ≤  d), and first assume EiA*Ei - 1 = 0. Put [formula]. By ([\ref=eq:VdecompS99]), and since each of [formula] is nonzero, we find [formula], [formula]. Observe AW  ⊆  W by the construction. Combining ([\ref=eq:asspread]) and our assumption, we find A*W  ⊆  W, and now condition (vi) of Definition [\ref=def:deflstalkS99] is contradicted. Next suppose Ei - 1A*Ei = 0. In this case we routinely find [formula] provides a contradiction to condition (vi) of Definition [\ref=def:deflstalkS99].

(ii) Similar to the proof of (i) above.

The relatives of a TD system

A given TD system can be modified in several ways to get a new TD system. For instance, let Φ denote the TD system in ([\ref=eq:ourstartingpt]), and let α, α*, β, β* denote scalars in F such that [formula], [formula]. Then

[formula]

is a TD system on V. Also,

[formula]

are TD systems on V. We refer to Φ* (resp. [formula]) (resp. [formula]) as the dual (resp. first inversion) (resp. second inversion) of Φ. Viewing [formula] as permutations on the set of all TD systems,

[formula]

The group generated by symbols [formula] subject to the relations ([\ref=eq:deightrelationsAS99]), ([\ref=eq:deightrelationsBS99]) is the dihedral group D4. We recall D4 is the group of symmetries of a square, and has 8 elements. Apparently [formula] induce an action of D4 on the set of all TD systems. Two TD systems will be called relatives whenever they are in the same orbit of this D4 action. The relatives of Φ are as follows:

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:dualtd] and Lemma [\ref=lem:tdsyspair], it is routine to show two TD systems are relatives if and only if their associated TD pairs are equal or dual.

We now introduce two sequences of parameters that we will use to describe a given TD system.

Let Φ denote the TD system in ([\ref=eq:ourstartingpt]). For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, we let θi denote the eigenvalue of A associated with Ei. We refer to [formula] as the eigenvalue sequence of Φ. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  δ, we let θ*i denote the eigenvalue of A* associated with E*i. We refer to [formula] as the dual eigenvalue sequence of Φ. We remark [formula] are mutually distinct, and [formula] are mutually distinct.

The split decomposition

In this section, F will denote a field, and V will denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension. We let

[formula]

denote a TD system on V, with eigenvalue sequence [formula] and dual eigenvalue sequence [formula].

Referring to the above definition, we will show δ  =  d. We will then show there exists a unique sequence [formula] of subspaces of V such that

[formula]

The following notation will be useful.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:splitconsetupS99], we set

[formula]

for all integers i,j. We interpret the sum on the left in ([\ref=eq:defofvijS99]) to be 0 (resp. V) if i < 0 (resp. i > δ). Similarily, we interpret the sum on the right in ([\ref=eq:defofvijS99]) to be V (resp. 0) if j < 0 (resp. j > d).

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:splitconsetupS99] and Definition [\ref=def:VijS99], we have

[formula]

[formula]

To get (i), set j = 0 in ([\ref=eq:defofvijS99]), and apply ([\ref=eq:VdecompS99]). Line (ii) is similarily obtained.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:splitconsetupS99] and Definition [\ref=def:VijS99], the following (i)-(iv) hold for 0  ≤  i  ≤  δ and 0  ≤  j  ≤  d.

(A - θjI)Vij  ⊆  Vi + 1,j + 1,

AVij  ⊆  Vij  +  Vi + 1,j + 1,

(A*  -  θ*iI)Vij  ⊆  Vi - 1,j - 1,

A*Vij  ⊆  Vij  +  Vi - 1,j - 1.

(i) Using ([\ref=eq:aspread]),

[formula]

and using ([\ref=eq:primid1S99]),

[formula]

Evaluating (A - θjI)Vij using ([\ref=eq:defofvijS99]), ([\ref=eq:aminusthetajAS99]), ([\ref=eq:aminusthetajBS99]), we routinely find it is contained in Vi + 1,j + 1.

(ii) Immediate from (i) above.

(iii) Using ([\ref=eq:primid1S99]),

[formula]

and using ([\ref=eq:asspread]),

[formula]

Evaluating (A*  -  θ*iI)Vij using ([\ref=eq:defofvijS99]), ([\ref=eq:aminusthetajAS99ag]), ([\ref=eq:aminusthetajBS99ag]), we routinely find it is contained in Vi - 1,j - 1.

(iv) Immediate from (iii) above.

The scalars d and δ from Definition [\ref=def:splitconsetupS99] are equal. Moreover, with reference to Definition [\ref=def:VijS99],

[formula]

Switching A and A* if necessary, we may assume δ  ≤  d. We first show ([\ref=eq:manyvijzeroS99]). To do this, we show the sum

[formula]

is zero for 0 < r  ≤  d. Let r be given, and let W denote the sum in ([\ref=eq:manyvijzeroAS99]). Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:howaactsonvijS99](ii),(iv), we find AW  ⊆  W and A*W  ⊆  W. By the definition of a TD system, we find W = 0 or W = V. By Definition [\ref=def:VijS99], each term in ([\ref=eq:manyvijzeroAS99]) is contained in

[formula]

so W is contained in ([\ref=eq:manyvijzeroBS99]). The sum ([\ref=eq:manyvijzeroBS99]) is properly contained in V by ([\ref=eq:VdecompS99]), and since r > 0. Apparently [formula], so W = 0. We have now shown ([\ref=eq:manyvijzeroAS99]) is zero for 0 < r  ≤  d, and ([\ref=eq:manyvijzeroS99]) follows. It remains to show δ  =  d. Suppose [formula], so that δ  <  d by our initial assumption. On one hand, setting i = δ, j = d in ([\ref=eq:manyvijzeroS99]), we find Vδd = 0. On the other hand Vδd = EdV by Lemma [\ref=lem:thevijbasicfactsS99](ii), so [formula]. We now have a contradiction, so δ  =  d.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:splitconsetupS99], let [formula] denote any subspaces of V. Then the following are equivalent.

[formula].

The sequence [formula] satisfies ([\ref=eq:vdecomp]), ([\ref=eq:Aaction]), ([\ref=eq:Asaction]).

For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, both

[formula]

(i)  →  (ii) To get ([\ref=eq:Aaction]) and ([\ref=eq:Asaction]), set j = i in Lemma [\ref=lem:howaactsonvijS99](i),(iii), and observe Ui  =  Vii. To obtain ([\ref=eq:vdecomp]), let W denote the sum on the right in that line. Then AW  ⊆  W by ([\ref=eq:Aaction]), and A*W  ⊆  W by ([\ref=eq:Asaction]). By the definition of a TD system, we find W = 0 or W = V. W contains U0, and U0 = E*0V is nonzero, so [formula]. It follows W = V, and in other words

[formula]

We show the sum ([\ref=eq:vijgivesdirsumCS99]) is direct. To do this, we show

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d. Let the integer i be given. From the construction

[formula]

for 0  ≤  j  ≤  i - 1, and

[formula]

It follows

[formula]

in view of Lemma [\ref=lem:manyvijzeroS99]. We have now shown the sum ([\ref=eq:vijgivesdirsumCS99]) is direct, so ([\ref=eq:vdecomp]) holds.

(ii)  →  (iii) First consider ([\ref=eq:vsumitod]). Let i be given, and abbreviate

[formula]

We show Z = W. To obtain Z  ⊆  W, set [formula], and observe Z = XV by ([\ref=eq:primid1S99])-([\ref=eq:primid3S99]). Using ([\ref=eq:Aaction]), we find XUj  ⊆  W for 0  ≤  j  ≤  d, so XV  ⊆  W in view of ([\ref=eq:vdecomp]). We now have Z  ⊆  W. To obtain W  ⊆  Z, set [formula], and observe

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq:Aaction]), we find YUj = 0 for i  ≤  j  ≤  d, so YW = 0. Combining this with ([\ref=eq:Keraction]), we find W  ⊆  Z. We now have Z = W and hence ([\ref=eq:vsumitod]). Line ([\ref=eq:vsumzeroi]) is similarily obtained.

(iii)  →  (i) We first show [formula] are linearly independent. To do this, we show

[formula]

is zero for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d. Let i be given. From ([\ref=eq:vsumitod]), ([\ref=eq:vsumzeroi]), we find ([\ref=eq:linindepag]) is contained in

[formula]

The expression ([\ref=eq:thatintagain]) equals Vi - 1,i, and is hence zero by Lemma [\ref=lem:manyvijzeroS99]. It follows ([\ref=eq:linindepag]) is zero, and we have now shown [formula] are linearly independent. Combining this with ([\ref=eq:vsumitod]), ([\ref=eq:vsumzeroi]), we find

[formula]

as desired.

Some projections

In this section, F will denote a field, and V will denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension. We let

[formula]

denote a TD system on V, with eigenvalue sequence [formula] and dual eigenvalue sequence [formula]. We let [formula] denote the subspaces of V that satisfy (i)-(iii) of Theorem [\ref=thm:maincharls].

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi], for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, we let Fi denote the linear transformation on V satisfying both

[formula]

In other words, Fi is the projection map from V onto Ui. For notational convenience, we define F- 1  =  0 and Fd + 1  =  0.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi] and Definition [\ref=def:deffi],

[formula]

Immediate from Definition [\ref=def:deffi] and ([\ref=eq:vdecomp]).

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi] and Definition [\ref=def:deffi], the products EiFj, FiEj, E*jFi, FjE*i are all zero for 0  ≤  i < j  ≤  d.

Let the integers i,j be given. Combining ([\ref=eq:primid2S99]), ([\ref=eq:vsumitod]), ([\ref=eq:fivjustvi]), we find

[formula]

so EiFj = 0. Similarily, using ([\ref=eq:vsumitod]) and ([\ref=eq:fiuj]),

[formula]

so FiEj = 0. The remaining assertions are similarily proved.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi] and Definition [\ref=def:deffi], we have

[formula]

for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d.

To obtain the equation on the left in ([\ref=eq:twoisoprelB]), we evaluate the expression

[formula]

in two ways. First, the expression ([\ref=eq:fisumfi]) equals Fi, since the sum in the middle is the identity, and since F2i = Fi. Pick any integer j (0  ≤  j  ≤  d). By Lemma [\ref=def:fielemprop], we have FiEj  =  0 if j > i, and EjFi  =  0 if j < i, so FiEjFi  =  0 if [formula]. Apparently ([\ref=eq:fisumfi]) equals FiEiFi, and we now have the equation on the left in ([\ref=eq:twoisoprelB]). The remaining equations are proved in a similar manner.

We interpret the above lemma as follows.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi] and Definition [\ref=def:deffi], the following (i), (ii) hold for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d.

The linear transformations

[formula]

are bijections, and moreover, they are inverses.

The linear transformations

[formula]

are bijections, and moreover, they are inverses.

(i) The maps are inverses in view of ([\ref=eq:twoisoprelB]). It follows they are bijections.

(ii) Similar to the proof of (i).

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi], for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, the dimensions of EiV, Ui, and E*iV are equal. Denoting this common dimension by ρi, we have ρi  =  ρd - i.

It is immediate from Lemma [\ref=def:efisofin] that the dimensions of EiV,Ui,E*iV are equal. Denote this common dimension by ρi. To show ρi  =  ρd - i, we show EiV and E*d - iV have the same dimension. We just showed EiV and E*iV have the same dimension. Applying this result to [formula], we find EiV and E*d - iV have the same dimension.

We finish this section with a remark.

Let the TD system Φ be as in ([\ref=eq:phidisplay]). Then for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, the space Ui from Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi], the projection Fi from Definition [\ref=def:deffi], and the scalar ρi from Corollary [\ref=thm:symunimodal] are all nonzero.

Recall ρi is the dimension of EiV, and this space is not zero, so [formula]. Ui has dimension ρi, so [formula]. Recall FiV = Ui, so [formula].

The raising and lowering maps

In this section, we continue to study the situation of Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi]. We introduce the raising and lowering maps, and use these to show the scalars ρi from Corollary [\ref=thm:symunimodal] form a unimodal sequence.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi], we define

[formula]

where [formula] are from Definition [\ref=def:deffi]. We refer to R (resp. L) as the raising map (resp. lowering map).

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi] and Definition [\ref=def:defRandL], for all integers i (0  ≤  i  ≤  d), and for all v∈Ui,

[formula]

To get the equation on the left, apply both sides of ([\ref=eq:defR]) to v, and evaluate the result using ([\ref=eq:fiui]), ([\ref=eq:fiuj]). The equation on the right is similarily obtained.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi] and Definition [\ref=def:defRandL],

RUi  ⊆  Ui + 1    (0  ≤  i < d),   RUd = 0.

LUi  ⊆  Ui - 1    (0  <  i  ≤  d),   LU0 = 0.

Combine Lemma [\ref=lem:defRandLaction] with ([\ref=eq:Aaction]) and ([\ref=eq:Asaction]).

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi], Definition [\ref=def:deffi], and Definition [\ref=def:defRandL],

RFi = Fi + 1R    (0  ≤  i  <  d),  RFd  =  0,  F0R  =  0.

LFi = Fi - 1L    (0 < i  ≤  d),  LF0 = 0,  FdL  =  0.

Rd + 1  =  0.

Ld + 1  =  0.

(i) Pick any integer i (0  ≤  i < d). Using Definition [\ref=def:deffi] and Corollary [\ref=lem:RandLbasic](i), we find the expression RFi  -  Fi + 1R vanishes on each of [formula], so this expression is zero in view of ([\ref=eq:vdecomp]). Similarily, RFd and F0R vanish on each of [formula], so they are zero.

(ii) Similar to the proof of (i).

(iii) Immediate from Corollary [\ref=lem:RandLbasic](i) and ([\ref=eq:vdecomp]).

(iv) Immediate from Corollary [\ref=lem:RandLbasic](ii) and ([\ref=eq:vdecomp]).

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi] and Definition [\ref=def:defRandL], pick any integers i,j (0  ≤  i  ≤  j  ≤  d). Then the linear transformation

[formula]

is an injection if i + j  ≤  d, a bijection if i + j = d, and a surjection if i + j  ≥  d. The linear transformation

[formula]

is an injection if i + j  ≥  d, a bijection if i + j = d, and a surjection if i + j  ≤  d.

(Caution: the maps ([\ref=eq:Rsur]), ([\ref=eq:Lsur]) are not inverses in general, even in the case i + j = d).

Concerning the map ([\ref=eq:Rsur]), first assume i + j  ≤  d. To show ([\ref=eq:Rsur]) is an injection, we pick any vector v∈Ui such that Rj - iv = 0, and show v = 0. Using Lemma [\ref=lem:defRandLaction] and Corollary [\ref=lem:RandLbasic](i),

[formula]

so

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq:vsumzeroi]), and since v∈Ui,

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:manyvijzeroS99] to [formula], and using j  ≤  d - i, we find

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=eq:vinsum]), ([\ref=eq:vinFiv]), ([\ref=eq:lem37again]), we find v = 0, and it follows ([\ref=eq:Rsur]) is an injection. Next suppose i + j = d. In this case Ui and Uj have the same dimension by Corollary [\ref=thm:symunimodal], so the injection ([\ref=eq:Rsur]) is actually a bijection. We now assume i + j  ≥  d, and show ([\ref=eq:Rsur]) is a surjection. To do this, we pick any w∈Uj, and obtain an element v∈Ui such that Rj - iv  =  w. From our comments above, the restriction of R2j - d to Ud - j is a bijection onto Uj, so there exists u∈Ud - j such that R2j - du  =  w. Set v  =  Ri + j - du. Applying Corollary [\ref=lem:RandLbasic](i), we find v∈Ui. Also

[formula]

and it follows ([\ref=eq:Rsur]) is a surjection. We have now proved all our claims about ([\ref=eq:Rsur]). To obtain our claims about ([\ref=eq:Lsur]), apply the first part of the lemma to [formula].

The scalars [formula] from Corollary [\ref=thm:symunimodal] satisfy ρi - 1  ≤  ρi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d / 2.

Let the spaces [formula] be as in Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi] and recall ρi is the dimension of Ui for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d. Pick any integer i (1  ≤  i  ≤  d / 2). By Lemma [\ref=lem:Risnotzero], we find the restriction of the raising map R to Ui - 1 is an injection into Ui, so ρi - 1  ≤  ρi.

We end this section with a result we will use later in the paper.

Let the TD system Φ be as in Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi], let the projections [formula] be as in Definition [\ref=def:deffi], and let the maps R,L be as in Definition [\ref=def:defRandL]. Then for 0  ≤  i  ≤  j  ≤  d, we have [formula] and [formula].

These maps are nonzero by Lemma [\ref=lem:thevifinotzero] and Lemma [\ref=lem:Risnotzero].

Writing products involving A and A* in terms of R and L

When working with a TD system such as ([\ref=eq:phidisplay]), instead of working directly with the elements A and A*, it is often easier to work with the correspondng raising map R and lowering map L from Definition [\ref=def:defRandL]. In this section, we consider how to write products involving A and A* in terms of R and L. We begin with some simple observations.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi] and Definition [\ref=def:deffi],

FiAFi  =  θiFi    (0  ≤  i  ≤  d),

Fi + 1AFi  =  RFi    (0  ≤  i  <  d),

[formula].

To verify these equations, in each case eliminate A using ([\ref=eq:defR]), and evaluate the result using Lemma [\ref=lem:fielem] and Lemma [\ref=lem:RandLnext].

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi] and Definition [\ref=def:deffi],

FiA*Fi  =  θ*iFi    (0  ≤  i  ≤  d),

Fi - 1A*Fi  =  LFi    (0  <  i  ≤  d),

[formula].

Similar to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:aandastarRL].

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi] and Definition [\ref=def:deffi], let n denote a positive integer, and let [formula] denote a sequence of elements taken from the set {A,A*}. Then for 0  ≤  r,s  ≤  d, the product

[formula]

with the sum interpreted as follows. The sum is over all sequences of integers

[formula]

such that 0  ≤  ij  ≤  d for 0  ≤  j  ≤  n, and such that

[formula]

where we define [A]  =  {0, - 1} and [A*]  =  {0,1}. For each sequence σ in ([\ref=eq:sequenceinsum]), the corresponding Wσ is the product [formula], where the Wi are given by

[formula]

and where R and L are from Definition [\ref=def:defRandL].

The left side of ([\ref=eq:onewaytowritesum]) equals [formula]. Eliminating each copy of I in this product using ([\ref=eq:fisumtoident]), and evaluating the result using Lemma [\ref=lem:aandastarRL] and Lemma [\ref=lem:astarandRL], we obtain the sum on the right side of ([\ref=eq:onewaytowritesum]).

For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1, we have

[formula]

Routine application of Lemma [\ref=lem:AandAstartoRL].

Recurrent sequences

It is going to turn out that the eigenvalue sequence and dual eigenvalue sequence of a TD system each satisfy a certain recurrence. In this section, we set the stage by considering this recurrence from several points of view.

In this section, F will denote a field, d will denote a nonnegative integer, and [formula] will denote a sequence of scalars taken from F.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:recseqsettupS99], let β,γ,ϱ denote scalars in F.

The sequence [formula] is said to be recurrent whenever [formula] for 2  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1, and

[formula]

is independent of i, for 2  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1.

The sequence [formula] is said to be β-recurrent whenever

[formula]

is zero for 2  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1.

The sequence [formula] is said to be (β,γ)-recurrent whenever

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1.

The sequence [formula] is said to be (β,γ,ϱ)-recurrent whenever

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:recseqsettupS99], the following are equivalent.

The sequence [formula] is recurrent.

There exists β∈F such that [formula] is β-recurrent, and [formula] for 2  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1.

Suppose (i), (ii), and that d  ≥  3. Then the common value of ([\ref=eq:thethingwhichisbetaS99]) equals β + 1.

Routine.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:recseqsettupS99], the following are equivalent for all β∈F.

The sequence [formula] is β-recurrent.

There exists γ∈F such that [formula] is (β,γ)-recurrent.

(i)  →  (ii) For 2  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1, the expression ([\ref=eq:betarecS99]) is zero by assumption, so

[formula]

Apparently the left side of ([\ref=eq:gammathreetermS99]) is independent of i, and the result follows.

(ii)  →  (i) Subtracting the equation ([\ref=eq:gammathreetermS99]) at i from the corresponding equation obtained by replacing i by i - 1, we find ([\ref=eq:betarecS99]) is zero for 2  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:recseqsettupS99], the following (i),(ii) hold for all β,γ∈F.

Suppose [formula] is (β,γ)-recurrent. Then there exists ϱ∈F such that [formula] is (β,γ,ϱ)-recurrent.

Suppose [formula] is (β,γ,ϱ)-recurrent, and that [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1. Then [formula] is (β,γ)-recurrent.

Let pi denote the expression on the left in ([\ref=eq:varrhothreetermS99]), and observe

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1. Assertions (i), (ii) are both routine consequences of this.

We mention the standard parametric expressions for recurrent sequences. To state the result, we let Fcl denote the algebraic closure of F.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:recseqsettupS99], pick any β∈F, and assume [formula] is β-recurrent. Then the following (i)-(iv) hold.

Suppose [formula], [formula], and pick q∈Fcl such that q + q- 1  =  β. Then there exists scalars α1,α2,α3 in Fcl such that

[formula]

Suppose β  =  2 and [formula]. Then there exists α1,α2,α3 in F such that

[formula]

Suppose β  =   - 2 and [formula]. Then there exists α1,α2,α3 in F such that

[formula]

Suppose β  =  0 and [formula]. Then there exists α1,α2,α3 in F such that

[formula]

where we define

[formula]

A few comments

In the next section, we are going to show the elements A and A* in a TD pair satisfy two cubic polynomial equations. In this section, we obtain a few preliminary results that we will need.

Throughout this section, F will denote a field, and V will denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension. We let A and A* denote linear transformations on V, with A diagonalizable. We let [formula] denote an ordering of the primitive idempotents of A. We let θi denote the eigenvalue of A associated with Ei, for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d. We remark [formula] are mutually distinct.

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:prelimsit], suppose

[formula]

and let D denote the subalgebra of [formula] generated by A. Then

[formula]

For notational convenience set E- 1 = 0, Ed + 1 = 0. Observe by ([\ref=eq:primid3S99]) and ([\ref=eq:caldpre1]) that for 0  ≤  j  ≤  d, both

[formula]

Pick any integer i (0  ≤  i  ≤  d). Summing ([\ref=eq:Aexpand2S99n]) over [formula], summing ([\ref=eq:Aexpand1S99n]) over [formula], and taking the difference between the two sums, we obtain

[formula]

where [formula]. Observe D is spanned by both [formula] and [formula], so

[formula]

and we have ([\ref=eq:calDS99n]).

With reference to Definition [\ref=def:prelimsit], suppose

[formula]

and pick any scalars β,γ,ϱ in F. Then

[formula]

if and only if the sequence [formula] is (β,γ,ϱ)-recurrent.

For notational convenience, we define a two variable polynomial p∈F[λ,μ] by

[formula]

Let C denote the expression on the right in ([\ref=eq:qdolanA]), and observe

[formula]

in view of ([\ref=eq:primid3S99]). Using ([\ref=eq:primid1S99]) and the definition of C, we find that for 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d,

[formula]

Suppose ([\ref=eq:qdolanA]) holds, so that C = 0. Then for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d, we have Ei - 1CEi = 0, and also [formula] by ([\ref=eq:caldpre2]), so p(θi - 1,θi) = 0 by ([\ref=eq:eicej]). Evaluating this using ([\ref=eq:defoftwovarp]) and Definition [\ref=lem:beginthreetermS99](iv), we find [formula] is (β,γ,ϱ)-recurrent. Conversely, suppose [formula] is (β,γ,ϱ)-recurrent. By Definition [\ref=lem:beginthreetermS99](iv) and ([\ref=eq:defoftwovarp]), we find p(θi - 1,θi) = p(θi,θi - 1)  =  0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d. Now for 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d, at least one of the factors on the right in ([\ref=eq:eicej]) equals zero, so EiCEj = 0. Apparently each term on the right in ([\ref=eq:csum]) is zero, so C = 0, and we have ([\ref=eq:qdolanA]).

Two polynomial equations for A and A*

Let F denote a field, and let (A,A*) denote a TD pair over F. Then there exists a sequence of scalars β,γ,γ*,ϱ,ϱ* taken from F such that both

[formula]

The sequence is unique if the diameter of the pair is at least 3.

Let [formula] denote a TD system associated with (A,A*). Let [formula] denote the eigenvalue sequence of Φ, and let [formula] denote the dual eigenvalue sequence of Φ. Let [formula] denote the projection maps for Φ, from Definition [\ref=def:deffi]. Let R and L denote the raising and lowering maps for Φ, from Definition [\ref=def:defRandL]. First assume d  ≥  3. Observe Φ satisfies ([\ref=eq:caldpre1]) by Definition [\ref=def:deflstalkS99](iv), so Lemma [\ref=lem:caldpre] applies. Taking X = A2,Y = A on the left in ([\ref=eq:calDS99n]), we find there exists scalars [formula] in F such that

[formula]

We show αi = 0   for 4  ≤  i  ≤  d. Suppose not, and set

[formula]

Multiplying each term in ([\ref=eq:qaskeywilsonCS99n]) on the left by Ft and on the right by F0, and evaluating the result using Lemma [\ref=lem:AandAstartoRL], we routinely find RtF0 times (θ*0  -  θ*t)αt is zero. However [formula] by Corollary [\ref=cor:Rnotzero], [formula] by construction, and we assumed [formula], so we have a contradiction. We now have   αi = 0   for 4  ≤  i  ≤  d, so ([\ref=eq:qaskeywilsonCS99n]) becomes

[formula]

We show [formula]. Suppose α3 = 0. Multiplying each term in ([\ref=eq:qaskeywilsonDS99n]) on the left by F3 and on the right by F0, and evaluating the result using Lemma [\ref=lem:AandAstartoRL], we routinely find R3F0 times θ*1  -  θ*2 is zero. Observe [formula] by Corollary [\ref=cor:Rnotzero], and [formula], so we have a contradiction. We have now shown [formula]. Set

[formula]

Observe AC - CA equals

[formula]

and this equals zero in view of ([\ref=eq:qaskeywilsonDS99n]). Hence A and C commute. Dividing C by α3 and using ([\ref=eq:qaskeywilsonFS99n]), we find A commutes with

[formula]

where

[formula]

We now have ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady199n]). Pick any integer i (2  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1). Multiplying each term in ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady199n]) on the right by Fi - 2 and on the left by Fi + 1, and evaluating the result using Lemma [\ref=lem:AandAstartoRL], we routinely find R3Fi - 2 times

[formula]

is zero. Observe [formula] by Corollary [\ref=cor:Rnotzero], so ([\ref=eq:alpha3recbet]) is zero, and it follows [formula] is β-recurrent in view of Definition [\ref=lem:beginthreetermS99](ii). Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:brecvsbgrecS99] and then Lemma [\ref=lem:bgrecvsbgdrecS99] to the sequence [formula], we find there exists scalars γ*,ϱ* in F such that this sequence is (β,γ*,ϱ*)-recurrent. Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:caldpre2] to Φ*, we obtain ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady2S99n]). Concerning uniqueness, let β,γ,γ*,ϱ,ϱ* denote any scalars in F satisfying ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady199n]), ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady2S99n]). Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:caldpre2], we find [formula] is (β,γ,ϱ)-recurrent. From this and our assumption d  ≥  3, one routinely finds β,γ,ϱ are uniquely determined. Similarily γ* and ϱ* are uniquely determined, and we have proved the theorem for the case d  ≥  3. Next assume d  ≤  2, and let β denote any scalar in F. If d = 2 set γ  =  θ0  -  βθ1  +  θ2, and if d  ≤  1 let γ denote any scalar in F. If d  ≥  1 set

[formula]

and if d = 0 let ϱ denote any scalar in F. Applying Definition [\ref=lem:beginthreetermS99](iv), we find the sequence [formula] is (β,γ,ϱ)-recurrent. Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:caldpre2], we find ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady199n]) holds. Applying the above argument to Φ*, we find there exists scalars γ*,ϱ* for which ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady2S99n]) holds.

The Dolan-Grady relations ([\ref=eq:DG1]), ([\ref=eq:DG2]) are the same thing as ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady199n]), ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady2S99n]) with β  =  2, γ  =  γ* = 0, ϱ = b2, ϱ* = b* 2. The quantum Serre relations ([\ref=eq:Serre1]), ([\ref=eq:Serre2]) are the same thing as ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady199n]), ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady2S99n]) with β  =  q + q- 1, γ  =  γ* = 0, ϱ  =  ϱ* = 0.

The eigenvalues and dual eigenvalues of a TD system

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=eq:lastchancedolangradyS99], we got an indication that the eigenvalues and dual eigenvalues of a TD system are recurrent. In this section, we give detailed results along this line.

Let F denote a field, let (A,A*) denote a TD pair over F, and let β,γ,γ*,ϱ,ϱ* denote scalars in F that satisfy ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady199n]), ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady2S99n]). Let [formula] (resp. [formula]). denote the eigenvalue sequence (resp. dual eigenvalue sequence), for an associated TD system. Then the expressions

[formula]

both equal β + 1, for   2  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1. Moreover,

[formula]

Let Φ denote the TD system referred to in the statement of the theorem. Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:caldpre2] to Φ, we find the sequence [formula] is (β,γ,ϱ)-recurrent, giving ([\ref=eq:vrhoform]). Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:bgrecvsbgdrecS99], and since the θi are distinct, we find the sequence [formula] is (β,γ)-recurrent, giving ([\ref=eq:gamform]). Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:brecvsbgrecS99], we find [formula] is β-recurrent, so the expressions on the left in ([\ref=eq:expsbetaplusone]) all equal β + 1. Applying our above comments to Φ*, we obtain the remaining assertions.

Let F denote a field. Let Φ denote a TD system over F, with eigenvalue sequence [formula] and dual eigenvalue sequence [formula]. Let β denote the scalar from Theorem [\ref=eq:lastchancedolangradyS99]. Then (i)-(iv) hold below.

Suppose [formula], and pick q∈Fcl such that q + q- 1  =  β. Then there exists scalars α1,α2,α3,α*1,α*2,α*3 in Fcl such that

[formula]

for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d. Moreover [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d.

Suppose β  =  2 and [formula]. Then there exists α1,α2,α3,α*1,α*2,α*3 in F such that

[formula]

for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d. Moreover [formula] or [formula].

Suppose β  =   - 2 and [formula]. Then there exists α1,α2,α3,α*1,α*2,α*3 in F such that

[formula]

for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d. Moreover [formula] or [formula].

Suppose β  =  0 and [formula]. Then d  ≤  3.

Most of the assertions are immediate from Lemma [\ref=lem:closedformthreetermS99], but a few points need explanation. Suppose we are in the situation of (i). Then using ([\ref=eq:closedformthreetermIS99]), we find that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d, qi = 1 implies θi  =  θ0, a contradiction. Suppose we are in the situation of (ii). Then using ([\ref=eq:closedformthreetermIIS99]), we find that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d, i = 0 (in F) implies θi  =  θ0, a contradiction. Hence [formula] or [formula]. Suppose we are in the situation of (iii). Then using ([\ref=eq:closedformthreetermIIIS99]), we find that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  d, i = 0 (in F) and i even implies θi  =  θ0. Hence [formula] or [formula]. Suppose we are in the situation of (iv), and that d  ≥  4. Then applying ([\ref=eq:closedformthreetermIVS99]), we find θ0  =  θ4, a contradiction. Hence d  ≤  3.

The raising and lowering maps, revisited

In this section we consider the implications of Theorem [\ref=eq:lastchancedolangradyS99] for the raising map R and the lowering map L.

Let Φ denote a TD system, with eigenvalue sequence [formula] and dual eigenvalue sequence [formula]. Let [formula] denote the spaces from Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi]. Let R and L denote the raising and lowering maps for Φ, from Definition [\ref=def:defRandL]. Then for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d - 2,

[formula]

vanishes on Ui, and

[formula]

vanishes on Ui + 2, where β is from Theorem [\ref=eq:lastchancedolangradyS99], and where

[formula]

Let the projections [formula] be as in Definition [\ref=def:deffi]. To get ([\ref=eq:RLint1]), multiply each term in ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady199n]) on the right by Fi, and on the left by Fi + 2, and simplify using Lemma [\ref=lem:AandAstartoRL]. To get ([\ref=eq:RLint2]), multiply each term in ([\ref=eq:qdolangrady2S99n]) on the left by Fi, and on the right by Fi + 2, and simplify using Lemma [\ref=lem:AandAstartoRL].

Referring to the above theorem, it is natural to consider when εi is independent of i. Below, we give one instance where this occurs.

Let F denote a field. Let Φ denote a TD system over F, with eigenvalue sequence [formula] and dual eigenvalue sequence [formula]. Suppose there exists scalars q,a,b,a*,c* in F such that

[formula]

Then the raising map R and the lowering map L from Definition [\ref=def:defRandL] satisfy the quantum Serre relations

[formula]

[formula]

where [r,s] means rs - sr.

Let Δ denote the expression on the right in ([\ref=eq:RLint1nice]). Evaluating ([\ref=eq:defofvareps]) using ([\ref=eq:niceeigs]), we find εi  =  0 for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d - 2. Evaluating ([\ref=eq:expsbetaplusone]) using ([\ref=eq:niceeigs]), we find β  =  q + q- 1. Using this information, we find ([\ref=eq:RLint1]) equals Δ. Applying Theorem [\ref=thm:howRLinteract], we find Δ vanishes on Ui for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d - 2. Using Corollary [\ref=lem:RandLbasic], we find Δ vanishes on Ui for i  =  d - 1 and i = d. Apparently Δ vanishes on each of [formula], and these span V, so Δ = 0, and we have ([\ref=eq:RLint1nice]). Applying a similar argument, we obtain ([\ref=eq:RLint2nice]).

Remarks and conjectures

In this section, we give some open problems and ideas for future research.

As we have indicated earlier, the main problem that we would like to see solved is the following.

Classify all the TD pairs.

The above problem might be difficult, but the fact that there is a classification in the thin case [\cite=LS99] gives us hope. To make headway on the non-thin case, we suggest one of the following two problems.

Classify all the TD pairs for which the sequence [formula] from Corollary [\ref=thm:symunimodal] is of the form [formula]. We remark these TD pairs play an important role in the theory of P-and Q-polynomial schemes[\cite=HobIto],[\cite=Tan].

Classify all the TD systems that satisfy the assumption of Theorem [\ref=thm:howRLinteractnice], where we assume the scalar q in that theorem is not a root of unity. Given the results of that theorem, it is natural to guess these TD sytems are related to representations of the quantum affine algebra [formula], where r2 = q. See [\cite=CPqaa], [\cite=CPqaar] for information on this algebra.

In light of Theorem [\ref=eq:lastchancedolangradyS99], we consider the following generalization of a TD pair. Let F denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension. By a generalized TD pair on V, we mean an ordered pair (A,A*), where A and A* are linear transformations on V such that (i), (ii) hold below.

There exists scalars β,γ,γ*,ϱ,ϱ* taken from F such that

[formula]

where [r,s] means rs - sr.

There is no subspace W of V such that both AW  ⊆  W, A*W  ⊆  W, other than W = 0 and W = V.

By Theorem [\ref=eq:lastchancedolangradyS99], any TD pair is a generalized TD pair. However, we should not expect every generalized TD pair to be a TD pair. We saw some indications of this in Example [\ref=ex:sl2easy], Example [\ref=def:onsager], and Example [\ref=def:serre]. In each of these examples, to get a TD pair, we needed to make an assumption about the ground field F. Also, in Example [\ref=def:serre], we made an assumption about the parameter q involved, which implies a restriction on β  =  q + q- 1. In addition, we assumed A and A* are not nilpotent. With these comments in mind, we pose the following problem.

Classify all the generalized TD pairs that are not TD pairs.

Given a field F, and given scalars β,γ,γ*,ϱ,ϱ* taken from F, let T = T(β,γ,γ*,ϱ,ϱ*) denote the associative F-algebra with identity generated by two symbols A, A* subject to the relations ([\ref=eq:qdolangradyfin1]), ([\ref=eq:qdolangradyfin2]). Let us call T a TD algebra. The generalized TD pairs are essentially the same thing as irreducible finite dimensional modules for TD algebras. Given the results of this paper, we would not be suprised if the TD algebras had some interesting properties, and we encourage the reader to look into this.

We mention the relations ([\ref=eq:qdolangradyfin1]), ([\ref=eq:qdolangradyfin2]) previously appeared in [\cite=TersubIII], in the context of P- and Q-polynomial association schemes [\cite=BanIto], [\cite=bcn], [\cite=Leopandq], [\cite=Tercharpq], [\cite=Ternew]. In [\cite=TersubIII], it is shown that for these schemes the matrices A and A* in Example [\ref=ex:pandq] satisfy ([\ref=eq:qdolangradyfin1]), ([\ref=eq:qdolangradyfin2]). In this context the algebra generated by A and A* is known as the subconstituent algebra or the Terwilliger algebra [\cite=Cau], [\cite=Col], [\cite=Curbip12], [\cite=CurNom], [\cite=Go], [\cite=HobIto], [\cite=Tan], [\cite=TersubI], [\cite=TersubII].

We mention the relations ([\ref=eq:qdolangradyfin1]), ([\ref=eq:qdolangradyfin2]) are satisfied by the generators of both the classical and quantum "Quadratic Askey-Wilson algebra" introduced by Granovskii, Lutzenko, and Zhedanov [\cite=GYLZmut]. See [\cite=GYZTwisted], [\cite=GYZL], [\cite=SVVZPer], [\cite=ZheHid], [\cite=ZheHiggs], [\cite=ZheCart] for more information on this algebra.

Here are a few conjectures about TD systems.

Let Φ denote a TD system with diameter d, and let [formula] denote the associated scalars from Corollary [\ref=thm:symunimodal]. We conjecture

[formula]

The above conjecture has been proven for d  ≤  3 by Tanabe.

Let F denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over F with finite positive dimension. Let Φ denote a TD system on V, and let d denote the diameter. Let the maps R and L be as in Definition [\ref=def:defRandL]. Let the space U0 be as in Definition [\ref=def:meaningofVi], and pick any nonzero vector v∈U0. We conjecture V is spanned by the vectors of the form

[formula]

where [formula] ranges over all sequences such that n is nonnegative and even, and such that [formula] are integers satisfying [formula]. For example, for d = 3, we are asserting V is spanned by

[formula]

Conjecture [\ref=con:Vspanguess] has been proved for d  ≤  3 by Tanabe. We remark the Conjecture [\ref=con:Vspanguess] implies Conjecture [\ref=conj:boundonsubdeg].

Let Φ denote a TD system with diameter d, and let [formula] denote the corresponding scalars from Corollary [\ref=thm:symunimodal]. Consider the polynomial

[formula]

in a variable t. We conjecture ([\ref=eq:rhopoly]) equals

[formula]

where [formula] are positive integers whose sum is d.

We remark Conjecture [\ref=conjfactor] implies Conjecture [\ref=conj:boundonsubdeg].
