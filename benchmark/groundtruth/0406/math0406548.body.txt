Introduction and Statement of the Results

Let M be a compact smooth (oriented) manifold of dimension n, and let M be the space of smooth Riemannian metrics on M endowed with a natural L2-Sobolev norm. This allows us to speak about differentiable functionals [formula]. A functional [formula] is called Riemannian if it is invariant under the action of the diffeomorphism group. We say that F has a gradient at g if there exists a symmetric tensor a∈C1 such that for every symmetric tensor h∈C1 we have

[formula]

where C1 denotes the space of symmetric tensors in [formula] and < , >  is the integral inner product.

A classical Riemannian functional is the total scalar curvature

[formula]

where scal denotes the scalar curvature function of g and μg is the volume element of g. An important point about this functional S, is that its critical points, when restricted to M1  =  {g∈M:vol(g) = 1}, are Einstein metrics. Also, its gradient is the Einstein tensor, precisely

[formula]

Where Ric denotes the Ricci tensor. A natural generalization of the functional S is the Riemannian functional

[formula]

where, for each 1  ≤  k  ≤  n / 2, h2k is the Gauss-Bonnet curvature of order 2k.This curvature is determined by the complete contraction of the Gauss-Kronecker tensor of order k. Furthermore, These curvatures coincide with the intrinsic curvature invariants of (M,g) which appear in the well known tube formula of H. Weyl [\cite=Wey], see section 2 below for precise definitions.

For k = 1, H2 = S / 2 is one half the total scalar curvature functional. Also, if the dimension n of M is even, then Hn does not depend on the metric. It is, up to a constant, the Euler-Poincaré characteristic of M.

Marcel Berger proved in [\cite=Berger] that the gradient of H4, like the gradient of S, depends only on the curvature tensor R and does not include its covariant derivatives. The expression of the gradient he obtained was complicated and hardly generalizable to higher H2k. So he asked the following two questions:

Does the above phenomena remain true for all higher H2k?.

Characterize the critical Riemannian metrics for the functional H2k.

In this paper, we completely answer the first question, and give partial answers to the second one. The main result of this paper is the following:

Main Theorem.  For every compact n-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M,g), and for every integer k such that 2  ≤  2k  ≤  n, the functional H2k is differentiable, and at g we have

[formula]

Where Rk denotes the exterior product of the Riemann curvature tensor R with itself k-times in the ring of curvature structures, c is the contraction map and 〈,〉 is the integral scalar product.

Remark that, for k = 1, the main theorem shows that

[formula]

So that we recover the above formula about the total scalar curvature. Also, in the case 2k = n, we have (see ([\ref=justif]) below):

[formula]

This is not a surprise, because Hn does not depend on the metric by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

Let us note here that the main theorem was established earlier by David Lovelock in a not well known paper to the mathematicians [\cite=lovelock]. His proof is based on classical tensor analysis. Our proof of the main theorem is simple and coordinate free. The key point of our proof is that it is possible to write the Gauss-Bonnet curvatures as exterior products of the metric g with the Riemann curvature tensor R (see the definition below for a precise formulation), then one can get the desired derivative using the power rule of differentiation and stokes' theorem. The main theorem shall be proved in section 4. In section 2, we recall some useful facts about the ring of curvature structures from [\cite=Labbi]. In section 3, we show that many of the classical results of Hodge theory on differential forms can be naturally extended to the context of double forms. We consider here only those results which shall be used later in this paper. Then, we define and study some operators on double forms which will play a key role in the proof of the main theorem.

In section 5, we study the critical metrics of the functional H2k, when restricted to a normalized conformal class of some metric, and we prove that they are metrics with constant (2k)-Gauss-Bonnet curvature. It is then natural to ask whether in each conformal class of a Riemannian metric, on a smooth compact manifold of dimension n > 2k, there exists a metric with constant (2k)-Gauss-Bonnet curvature. That is a natural generalization of the famous Yamabe problem.

Finally, in section 6 we examine some properties of the critical metrics of the functional H2k in the space of all Riemannian metrics with volume 1. These are generalized Einstein metrics.

Preliminaries

Let (M,g) be a compact smooth (oriented) Riemannian manifold of dimension n. We denote by [formula] the ring of differential forms on M. Considering the tensor product over the ring of smooth functions, we define [formula] where [formula]. It is a graded associative ring and it is called the ring of double forms on M. The exterior product in D, sometimes called the Kulkarni-Nomizu product, will be denoted by a dot., this shall be omitted whenever possible.

The ring of curvature structures on M is the ring [formula] where Cp denotes symmetric elements in Dp,p.

The standard inner product < , >  on Λ* pM and the Hodge star operator *   extend in a natural way to D (we assume here that the manifold is orientable). These were used in [\cite=Labbi] to study several properties of this ring. In particular, the following relations are proved for all ω,ω1,ω2∈D:

[formula]

[formula]

Where c denotes the contraction map. Also, for all ω,θ∈Dp,q, we have

[formula]

[formula]

Remark. A double form ω∈Dp,q can be seen as a symmetric bilinear form acting on p-vectors. Under this identification one can check easily that The minus sign appears in fact because for a usual p-form θ and for the usual Hodge star operator we have ( * θ)(.) = ( - 1)p(n - p)θ( * .).

In the following, we shall denote by ωq, the product of ω with itself q-times in the ring C.

Let us recall the following definitions:

The (p,q)-curvature, denoted s(p,q), for [formula] and 0  ≤  p  ≤  n - 2q, is the sectional curvature of the following (p,q)-curvature tensor

[formula]

In other words, for a tangent p-plane P, s(p,q)(P) is the sectional curvature of the tensor [formula] at the orthogonal complement of P.

Note that the tensors R(p,q) satisfy the first Bianchi identity and they are divergence free.

Here in this paper, we are mainly interested in the following special cases, the (0,q) and (1,q)-curvatures:

Let q be a positive integer such that 2  ≤  2q  ≤  n.

The (2q)-Gauss-Bonnet curvature, denoted h2q, is the (0,q)-curvature. That is the function defined on M by

[formula]

The (2q)-Einstein-Lovelock tensor, denoted T2q, is defined to be the (1,q)-curvature tensor, that is

[formula]

If 2q = n, we set Tn = o.

Recall the following properties of these curvatures [\cite=Labbi]

[formula]

that is the complete contraction of Rq. Also,

[formula]

For q = 1 we recover the usual Einstein tensor [formula]. For 2q = n, we have [formula] for some constant λ, hence

[formula]

This justifies our definition for Tn.

Note that c2q - 1Rq can be considered as a generalization of the Ricci curvature tensor. Remark. Let us remark here some analogies between the Einstein-Lovelock tensors and the usual Einstein tensor. Recall that, the former is the main linear combination of the metric tensor g and its Ricci curvature to be divergence free. The same property is true for Einstein-Lovelock tensors if we substitute the generalized Ricci curvatures c2q - 1Rq to the usual one. Another similarity between these tensors can be noticed at the level of their sectional curvatures: The full contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor R in the directions orthogonal to a given direction v produces the sectional curvature of the usual Einstein tensor, that is T2(v,v). Doing the same operation but for the Gauss-Kronecker tensors Rq one generates the sectional curvatures of the Einstein-Lovelock tensors, that is T2q(v,v). Finally, let us recall the following property [\cite=Labbi] which provides another analogy:

[formula]

The Second Bianchi Map and other Differential Operators

The second Bianchi sum, denoted D, maps Dp,q into Dp + 1,q. For ω∈Dp,q, we have

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the covariant differentiation with respect to the metric g.

If we identify double forms with vector valued differential forms, then D coincides with the operator of exterior differentiation of vector valued differential forms [\cite=Besse]. In particular, the restriction of D to Dp,0 coincides with - d, where d is the usual exterior derivative on p-forms. A second possible extension of d is the adjoint second Bianchi sum:

[formula]

defined for ω∈Dp,q by

[formula]

Note that in general we have neither D2 = 0 nor D̃2 = 0. The composition of these two operators is the operator

[formula]

[formula]

Remark that the restriction of DD̃ to D0,0 is the usual Hessian operator on functions, precisely

[formula]

Also, note that for h∈D1,1, we have

[formula]

Similarly, one can also consider the differential operator

[formula]

If ω is a symmetric double form, DD̃ω and D̃Dω are not necessarily symmetric. Nevertheless, it is true that

[formula]

Consequently, the following operator is well defined and will play an important role in the proof of the main theorem

[formula]

This operator can be considered as a natural generalization, to the ring Cp, of the usual Hessian operator on functions.

On the other hand, it is easy to check that for ω∈Dp,q and θ∈Dr,s we have

[formula]

The operator δ = cD̃  +  D̃c was defined by Kulkarni [\cite=Kulk] as a natural generalization of the classical δ operator. Using the Hodge star operator we shall extend some classical results of Hodge theory to double forms as follows:

If   *   denotes the generalized Hodge star operator on D, then we have

[formula]

for every (p,q)-form ω such that p  ≥  1.

Proof. Let ω∈Dp,q, and (xi), (yj) orthonormal vector fields about m∈M such that [formula]. Then at m we have Therefore D * ω = ( - 1)n + 1  *  δω. [formula]

With respect to the integral scalar product, the operator

[formula]

is the formal adjoint of the operator D.

Proof. Let ω1∈Dp,q and ω2∈Dp + 1,q then Applying the generalized Hodge operator to both sides of the previous equation we get Note that, the integral of the left hand side is zero by stokes' theorem. This completes the proof. [formula]

In the same way, one can prove without difficulties that if  = cD + Dc then for every (p,q)-form ω with q  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

and also that

[formula]

is the formal adjoint of D̃ with respect to the integral scalar product.

For p,q  ≥  1, The operators δ and δ send Dp,q to Dp - 1,q - 1 and respectively satisfy

[formula]

Furthermore, with respect to the integral scalar product, they are respectively the formal adjoints of the operators ( - 1)p + qDD̃ and ( - 1)p + qD̃D.

For p,q  ≥  1, The operator δ  +  δ sends Dp,q to Dp - 1,q - 1 and satisfies

[formula]

Furthermore, with respect to the integral scalar product, it is the formal adjoint of the operator ( - 1)p + q(DD̃  +  D̃D).

Proof. It is a direct consequence of ([\ref=adjoint:D]) and ([\ref=adjoint:Dtilde]). [formula]

Remark that since Dg = 0 and DR = 0, then D(gpRq) = 0. However the tensors R(p,q) do not in general satisfy the second Bianchi identity. Nevertheless, they are divergence free, In fact,

[formula]

This fact is used to prove the following proposition:

Let p,q  ≥  1. If at every point m∈M the (p,q)-curvature is a constant (that is on the fiber at m), then it is a constant.

Proof. Recall that at each m∈M we have

[formula]

where λ  =  λ(m) is constant at m.

Since the tensors R(p,q) are divergence free, then

[formula]

and therefore, (see [\cite=Labbi])

[formula]

Consequently dλ = 0. This completes the proof. [formula]

Another operator which also will play a central role in the proof of the main theorem is defined as follows:

For each h∈C1, we define the operator Fh:Cp  →  Cp as follows. Let m∈M and {e1,...,en} be an orthonormal basis of TmM diagonalizing h , then its value on basis elements is

[formula]

It is not difficult to see that if ω satisfies the first Bianchi identity then so does Fh(ω). Below we shall prove some useful properties of this operator.

For all ω∈Cp and θ∈Cq we have

[formula]

That is, Fh acts by derivations on C. In particular we have

[formula]

Proof. Let m∈M and {e1,...,en} be an orthonormal basis of TmM diagonalizing h. Let {i1,...,ip + q} and {j1,...,jp + q} be arbitrary subsets of {1,...,n} both with p + q elements, then at m we have This completes the proof of the proposition. [formula]

The operator Fh is self adjoint, precisely for all ω,θ∈C we have

[formula]

Proof. Let {e1,...,en} be an orthonormal basis diagonalizing h at m∈M, let {i1,...,ip} and {j1,...,jp} be arbitrary subsets of {1,...,n} both with p elements, then at m we have The proposition results immediately after taking the corresponding sums. [formula]

The following properties can be checked without difficulties:

The following are true about the operators Fh:

If ω∈Cp then [formula]

If ω∈Cp then Fg(ω) = 2pω.

If p  ≥  1, then Fh(gp) = 2pgp - 1h.

If h,k∈C1 and [formula] denote respectively the associated linear operators on the tangent space, then

If ω∈C2 and h∈C1, then for all tangent vectors x,y,z,u we have:

[formula]

where in the right hand side, ω was considered as a (3,1)-tensor by the mean of the metric g.

If ω∈Cn, then Fh(ω) = 2(trgh)ω.

Remark. The operator Fh can also alternatively be defined by declaring that it acts by derivations on C and that its restriction to C1 is the symmetric multiplication by h as in the property 4 of the previous proposition.

Proof of the Main Theorem

The proof is based on the following two lemmas. The first lemma asserts that the directional derivative of the Riemann curvature tensor when considered as a symetric double form is the sum of an "exact" double form and a term which depends linearly on the curvature:

The derivative of the Riemann curvature structure R∈C2 in the direction of h∈C1 is given by

[formula]

Proof. Recall that, the directional derivatives [formula], R'h at g of the Levi-Civita connection and the (3,1)-Riemann curvature tensor are respectively given by [\cite=Besse]

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore the derivative of R, seen as a double form [formula], in the direction of h∈C1 is given by Where, in the last step, we have used the following identity

[formula]

Now using ([\ref=DDh:form]), we get

[formula]

To get the derivative of R, as a symmetric curvature structure, i.e. in C2, it suffices to take the projection of the previous one, that is This completes the proof of the lemma. [formula]

Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold and h∈C1, then the differential of h2k at g, in the direction of h, is given by

[formula]

Proof. Recall that

[formula]

where μg is considered in the previous formula as an n-vector. then using the previous lemma, we have Using first ([\ref=dom:thet]) and then ([\ref=adjoint:dtilded]), we have On the other hand, using simultaneously formulas ([\ref=fhomk]),([\ref=IPHodge]), ([\ref=fh:autoadjoint]), proposition [\ref=extra] and formula ([\ref=conjugg]), we get Recall that [formula], then finally we have

[formula]

The proof of the lemma is now complete. [formula]

Remarks.

In contrast with the volume form, the derivative of μg seen as an n-vector is [formula] and not just [formula]. This fact was used in the previous proof.

The previous two lemmas are of local nature.

We are now ready to prove the main theorem. Note that for k∈C1, both δk and δk are divergences of some differential 1-form. Therfore their integral is zero by Stokes' theorem. This applies particularly to [formula] of the previous formula, so that, This completes the proof of the main theorem. [formula]

A Generalized Yamabe Problem

As a consequence of the main theorem, we have the following result

For a compact Riemannian manifold (M,g) with dimension n > 2k, the (2k)-Gauss-Bonnet curvature h2k is constant if and only if g is a critical point for the functional H2k when restricted to the set Conf0(g) of metrics pointwise conformal to g and having the same total volume.

Proof. We proceed as in the case of the scalar curvature [\cite=Besse]. Note that g is a critical point of H2k when restricted to Conf0(g) if and only if at g we have

[formula]

for all smooth functions f such that [formula].

Next using the main theorem, we have Consequently, for [formula], H2k'.fg = 0 if and only if the function f is orthogonal to h2k.

Finally, consider the function

[formula]

it is orthogonal to h2k and to the constants, then it is the zero function. This completes the proof. [formula]

It is then natural to ask whether for each k we have:

Question: (Generalized Yamabe problem.)

In each conformal class of a fixed Riemannian metric on a smooth compact manifold with dimension n > 2k there exists a metric with h2k constant.

A closely related and at the same time parallel problem to the previous one is the σk-Yamabe problem. It is at present the subject of intensive researches. We can state it as follows: Let σk denote the symmetric function of order k in the eigenvalues of the Schouten tensor. For each k, there exists in each conformal class of a fixed Riemannian metric on a smooth compact manifold a metric with σk constant.

These two problems coincide in the class of a conformally flat metric and when k is even. In fact, in this case the curvatures h2k and σ2k differ only by a constant factor, [\cite=Labbi]. Remark also, that both problems generalize the classical Yamabe problem obtained for k = 1 and k = 2 respectively. The σk-Yamabe problem was recently proved for k > n / 2 by Gursky and Viaclovsky [\cite=Gursky] with the assumption that the original metric is "admissible". Then Sheng, Trudinger and Wang [\cite=Trudinger] completed the proof of the remaining cases where 2  ≤  k  ≤  n / 2 after assuming that the relevant equation is variational. Note also that the σk-Yamabe problem was solved in the conformally flat case by Li-Li [\cite=Lili], and Guan-Wang [\cite=Guan].

Remark. The curvatures h2k are in general different from the symmetric functions in the eigenvalues of the Riemann curvature operator R. In fact, they are not even in general symmetric polynomials in the eigenvalues of R as one can check it easily. In fact, for a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold, suppose the eigenvectors of R are all of rank 1 (decomposed) and let λ1,...,λ6 denote the eigenvalues of R. Let us re-arrange so that λ1,λ2 (resp. λ3,λ4 and λ5,λ6) are two eigenvalues corresponding to supplementary 2-planes (eigenvectors), then h4, up to a constant, equals λ1λ2  +  λ3λ4  +  λ5λ6. This is clearly not a symmetric polynomial in λ1,...,λ6.

Generalized Einstein Manifolds

The usual Einstein metrics are the critical metrics for the total scalar curvature functional when restricted to those metrics with unit volume. Similarly, considering the critical metrics of the functional associated to the Gauss-Bonnet curvatures we obtain generalized Einstein metrics. Precisely:

For 2  ≤  2k  ≤  n, we say that (M,g) is (2k)-Einstein if its (2k)-Einstein-Lovelock tensor is proportional to the metric, that is

[formula]

Note that since the tensors T2k are divergence free, the function λ is then a constant.

Also, the 2-Einstein manifolds are the usual Einstein manifolds, and when n = 2k, we have T2k = 0 for any metric on M.

The class of (2k)-Einstein Riemannian manifolds contains the manifolds with constant sectional curvature, and all isotropy irreducible homogeneous manifolds with their canonical Riemannian metrics.

Examples.

Let M be an arbitrary Riemannian manifold with dimension n  ≥  3, the Riemannian product [formula] is with T2k = 0 for 2k  ≥  n but T2 is not proportional to the metric. This example shows that in some sens the generalized Einstein condition is weaker then the usual one. But this is not always true, as shown by the next example:

Let M be a 4-dimensional Ricci-flat but not flat manifold (for example a K3 surface endowed with the Calabi-Yau metric), and Tq be a flat torus. Then the Riemannian product M  ×  Tq is Einstein in the usual sens (T2 = 0), but it is not 4-Einstein.

Let (M,g) be a conformally flat manifold, then it can be shown without difficulties that if (M,g) is (2k)-Einstein then the Ricci tensor has at each point at most k distinct eigenvalues. Similar results hold for hypersurfaces of the Euclidean space.

With respect to the orthogonal decomposition into irreducible components of the ring of curvature structures [\cite=Kulk] [\cite=Labbi], the Gauss-Kronecker tensor Rq splits to

[formula]

Evidently, the tensor T2k is proportional to the metric if and only if the generalized Ricci tensor c2k - 1Rk is also proportional to the metric. Therefore it results immediately from lemma 5.7 of [\cite=Labbi] the following proposition.

A Riemannian metric is (2q)-Einstein if and only if the component ω1 of Rq with respect to the irreducible splitting ([\ref=decomp]) vanishes.

The previous result generalizes a similar well known result about the usual Einstein metrics.
