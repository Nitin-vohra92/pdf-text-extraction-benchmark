A contractible Levi-flat hypersurface which is a determining set for pluriharmonic functions

The main result

A real hypersurface M in an n-dimensional complex manifold is Levi-flat if it is foliated by complex manifolds of dimension n - 1; this Levi foliation is as smooth as M itself according to Barrett and Fornæ ss [\cite=BF]. If M is real analytic, it is locally near every point defined by a pluriharmonic function v: [formula]. One might expect that an oriented, real analytic, Levi flat hypersurface admits a pluriharmonic defining function on any topologically simple relatively compact domain, perhaps under an additional analytic asumption such as the existence of a fundamental system of Stein neighborhoods (see e.g.  Theorem 2 in [\cite=T], p. 298). Here we show that, on the contrary, even a most simple domain in a real analytic Levi flat hypersurface may be a determining set for pluriharmonic functions.

There exist an ellipsoid [formula] and a real analytic, Levi-flat hypersurface [formula] intersecting the boundary bB transversely such that the Levi foliation of M has trivial holonomy and [formula] satisfies the following:

[formula] is diffeomorphic to the three-ball and admits a Stein neighborhood basis.

Any real analytic function on A which is constant on Levi leaves is constant.

Any pluriharmonic function in a connected open neighborhood of A in [formula] which vanishes on A is identically zero.

The Levi foliation of M in our proof is a simple foliation ([\cite=God1], p. 79) whose leaves are complex discs. Likely one can also obtain a similar example in the ball of [formula]. On the other hand, for any compact subset A in a real analytic, simply connected Levi-flat hypersurface M there is a smooth defining function v for M whose pluricomplex Laplacian ddcv is flat on A; this suffices for the construction of Stein neighborhood basis of certain compact subsets of M [\cite=FL].

We mention that D. Barrett gave an example of a compact real analytic Levi-flat hypersurface with trivial holonomy and without a global pluriharmonic defining function (Theorem 3 in [\cite=Ba]). His example is the quotient of [formula] by (θ,z)  →  (φ(θ),2z) where φ is a real analytic diffeomorphism of the circle S1 which is topologically but not diffeomorphically conjugate to a rotation.

A real analytic foliation of [formula] without analytic first integrals

Our construction of the hypersurface M in theorem [\ref=Maintheorem] is based on the following.

Let D be the open unit disc in [formula]. There exists a real analytic foliation F of [formula] by closed lines such that any real analytic function on D which is constant on every leaf of the restricted foliation F|D is constant.

While we cannot exclude the possibility that an example of this kind is contained in the vast literature on the subject, we could not find a precise reference in some of the standard sources concerning foliations of the plane ([\cite=HR], [\cite=Ha], [\cite=God1], [\cite=God2], [\cite=CC]). It is known that every smooth foliation of [formula] by lines has a global continuous first integral but in general not one of class C1, not even in the analytic case (Wazewsky [\cite=W]); however, there exists a smooth first integral without critical points on any relatively compact subset (Kamke [\cite=K]).

Let (x,y) be coordinates on [formula]. Define subsets [formula] by

[formula]

Let Fj denote the restriction of the foliation [formula] to Ej (j = 1,2). Let ψ be a real analytic orientation preserving diffeomorphism of the half line (0, +   ∞  ), so [formula]. (We do not require that ψ extends analytically to a neighborhood of 0.) Then φ(x,y) = (x,ψ(y)) is a real analytic diffeomorphism of the upper half plane [formula] onto itself which maps every leaf of F1|E1,2 to a leaf of F2|E1,2. Let E be the quotient of the topological (disjoint) sum [formula] obtained by identifying a point (x,y)∈E1 belonging to E1,2 with the point φ(x,y)∈E2. The foliations Fj (j = 1,2) amalgamate into a real analytic foliation F on E.

By construction E is a real analytic manifold homeomorphic to [formula], and hence there exists a real analytic diffeomorphism of E onto [formula]. (This follows in particular from the classification theorem for simply connected Riemann surfaces.) We identify E with [formula] and denote the resulting real analytic foliation of [formula] by F  =  Fψ. Let [formula] denote the projection onto the space of leaves. Q admits the structure of a non-Hausdorff real analytic manifold such that π is a real analytic submersion. (The real analytic structure on Q is obtained by declaring the restriction of π to any local analytic transversal [formula] to F to be a diffeomorphism of [formula] onto the open set [formula]. For the details see [\cite=Ha], [\cite=HR].) In our case Q is the quotient of the topological sum [formula] of two copies of the real axis obtained by identifying a point t > 0 in [formula] with the point [formula] (no identifications are made for points t  ≤  0). The only pair of branch points in Q (i.e., points without a pair of disjoint neighborhoods) are those corresponding to [formula] and [formula].

If ψ is flat at origin [formula] for [formula] then every real analytic function on [formula] which is constant on every leaf of Fψ is constant.

A real analytic function f on [formula] which is constant on the leaves of the foliation Fψ is of the form [formula] for some real analytic function [formula], where Q is the space of leaves. From our construction of the foliation it follows that h is given by a pair of real analytic functions [formula] (j = 1,2) satisfying h1(t) = h2(ψ(t)) for t > 0. As [formula], the flatness of ψ at 0 implies that the derivative h1' is flat at 0. Hence h1, and therefore also h2, are constant.

Fix ψ and consider the following pair of subsets of E1 resp. E2:

[formula]

Let D be the quotient of the disjoint sum [formula] obtained by identifying any point (x,y)∈D1 such that 1 < y < 2 with the point φ(x,y) = (x,ψ(y))∈D2. Clearly D is a simply connected domain with compact closure in [formula], and the space of leaves QD  =  D / F is a non-Haudorff manifold with a simple branch at [formula] resp. [formula].

If ψ is flat at the origin then every real analytic function f on D which is constant on every leaf of Fψ|D is constant.

As in lemma [\ref=lemma1] such f is of the form [formula] for some real analytic function h on QD = D / Fψ. Such h is given by a pair of real analytic functions [formula], [formula] satisfying h1(t) = h2(ψ(t)) for 1 < t < 2. By analyticity this relation persists on the largest interval on which both sides are defined, which is (0,2). By flatness of ψ at 0 we conclude as in lemma [\ref=lemma1] that h1 and h2 must be constant.

Let F  =  Fψ be the foliation of [formula] constructed above with the diffeomorphism ψ(t) = te- 1 / t of (0, +   ∞  ) (which is flat at 0). Let [formula] satisfy the conclusion of lemma [\ref=lemma2]. Choose a disc containing D; clearly lemma [\ref=lemma2] still holds for this disc, and by an affine change of coordinates on [formula] we may assume this to be the unit disc. This completes the proof of proposition [\ref=proposition].

Proposition [\ref=proposition] holds for any foliation Fψ constructed above for which the diffeomorphism ψ of (0, +   ∞  ) is such that [formula] does not extend as a real analytic function to a neighborhood of 0 for any real analytic function h near 0. An example is tα for an irrational α > 0. The foliation of [formula] determined by the algebraic 1-form ω  =  (α - x)(1 + x)dy  -  xdx has the space of leaves C1-diffeomorphic to the 'simple branch' Q determined by ψ(t) = tα ([\cite=God2], p. 120); hence it might be possible to find a disc [formula] satisfying the proposition [\ref=proposition] for this foliation. These examples indicate that a real analytic foliation of [formula] only rarely admits real analytic first integrals on large compact subsets.

Proof of theorem 1.1

Let F be a real analytic foliation of [formula] furnished by the proposition [\ref=proposition] such that any real analytic function on [formula] which is constant on the leaves of F|D is constant. Denote by (x1 + iy1,x2 + iy2) the coordinates on [formula] and identify [formula] with the plane [formula]. Complexifying the leaves of F we obtain the Levi foliation of a closed, real analytic, Levi-flat hypersurface M in an open tubular neighborhood [formula] of [formula]. Set B  =  {x21 + x22  +  c(y21 + y22) < 1} where c > 0 is chosen sufficiently large such that [formula]. Note that [formula]. A generic choice of c insures that M intersects bB transversely (since transversality holds along [formula]). Set [formula]. If B is sufficiently thin (which is the case if c is sufficiently large) then clearly [formula] is diffeomorphic to the closed ball in [formula]. If a real analytic function u∈Cω(A) is constant on every Levi leaf of A then u|D is constant on every leaf of F|D and hence is constant. Thus A satisfies property (ii) in theorem [\ref=Maintheorem].

The foliation F of [formula] is transversely orientable and hence admits a transverse real analytic vector field ν. Its complexification is a holomorphic vector field w in a neighborhood of [formula] in [formula] such that iw is transverse to M in a neighborhood of [formula], provided that B is chosen sufficiently thin. Moving M off itself to either side by a short time flow of iw in a neighborhood of [formula] we obtain thin neighborhoods of [formula] with two Levi-flat boundary components; intersecting these with rB for r > 1 close to 1 gives a fundamental system of Stein neighborhoods of [formula].

Suppose that v is a real pluriharmonic function in a connected open neighborhood of A such that v|A = 0. For every point x∈A there is an open connected neighborhood Ux  ⊂  B and a pluriharmonic function ux on Ux, determined up to a real constant, such that ux + iv is holomorphic on Ux. Since A is contractible, [formula] and hence the collection {ux}x∈A can be assembled into a pluriharmonic function u in a neighborhood of A such that u + iv is holomorphic. Since v|A = 0, u is constant on every Levi leaf on A and hence constant by property (ii) of A. Thus v is constant and hence identically zero. This proves theorem [\ref=Maintheorem].
