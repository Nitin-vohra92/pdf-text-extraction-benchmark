Quantum mechanics without amplitudes

The difficulties in treating quantum mechanics as a closed theory come from the fact that its main logical object - the amplitude - has no reality content, cannot be measured. Because this an interpretation is needed, such as that of the Copenhagen School, in order to connect properly physics to formalism. Interpretation introduces additional logical elements, like wave packet reduction or Schrödinger's cat, all also sharing the property of having no reality content. Recently Diósi et all [\cite=diosi] and Brun [\cite=brun] showed that the measurement process, treated as a quantum open system, selects paths in the evolution of the amplitudes that are relevant to another interpretation, that of consistent histories, introduced by Griffiths in the 80's [\cite=griffiths] and by Omnes [\cite=omnes] and Gell-Man and Hartle [\cite=gell]. In some sense this interpretation closes the theory because amplitude histories are selected by chance and this process is algoritimizable. This means that a physical content may be given to the process of selecting histories. A code may be writeen, using random numbers, simulating this process. In this sense amplitude is a non-algoritimizable object. No physical process can select a path using amplitudes. No dice has a face selected using amplitudes. In the history interpretation amplitudes are used so the reality of the evolution of a quantum system still has meaning only at the measurement time. In this context we can ask about a minimally open theory, meaning a formulation of quantum theory with a minimum set of non-algoritimizable objects. It would be desirable that such an approach eliminate amplitudes from its formalism and treat quantum evolution as a fully probabilistic process. A difficulty in this case is how to include phase effects. The possibility of such formulation is the focus of this work. We will show that quantum mechanics itself provides the elements needed for establishment of a theory of quantum probabilities and as consequence, new physics appears, hidden in the amplitude formalism, but fully inserted in its information content. This possibility is not evident. The vast efforts in looking for a stochastic justification for Quantum Mechanics have no met with success. However recently Skorobogatov and Svertilov [\cite=slobodov] showed that quantum probabilities satisfy a non-Markovian extension of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. This put quantum probabilities inside the class of classical probability theory, a fully algoritimizable object. Although the noise source is not explicit in this formulation its existence is guaranteed by the equation itself, as already known in the Fokker-Planck formalism of Markovian processes.

A theory of quantum probabilities must satisfy two requisites. It must have at least the same range of amplitude-based calculations and must satisfy an algoritimizable axiomatic body. The question is to know whether using only quantum mechanics a complete theory of probabilities can be obtained, satisfying both requisites. The first one is satisfied by construction since it is a consequence of calculations using amplitudes and the rules of the quantum theory. The second one demands that quantum physics be described by logical objects mappable on processes using classical logic, like tosses of coins, classical dynamics, stochastic processes or Turing machines. This work try to shed light on how to address this problem. Since no elements, foreign to quantum mechanics can be used, it is clear that the second requisite must be consequence of the first. Thus amplitudes will be treated here as the only acceptable logical object necessary to drive the formulation of the theory. For this consider the quantum amplitude written as a time sliced path integral

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the Feynman kernel and

[formula]

the discretized classical action. Here tn = nε and all paths end at the space-time point  xN + 1 = x and t = tN. The probability [formula] for the truncated path integral

[formula]

is given by

[formula]

Since only the point xN + 1 is common to all paths the wave function evolves freely untill the instant just before we calculate probabilities. At this moment only those paths that end at xN + 1 = x are selected and probabilities depend on the mutual interference of these selected paths. In terms of non-dimensional variables [formula] and [formula] these interfering paths involve a difference of action given by

[formula]

In terms of the mean and difference path variables, [formula] and [formula], this difference presents some novel features. Define the acceleration by [formula] and the force by [formula] in order to write SN as

[formula]

Using these new variables the Markovian character of the Feynman kernel is broken. This is a consequence of the specific form of the kinetic energy term that reorders ΔSN into a non-Markovian chain in the mean path variable and a local-in-time process in the difference variables. Using eqn[formula] to obtain probabilities we get

[formula]

For index n = 0 the above equation can be integrated for β0 as

[formula]

Writing [formula] where the phase φ is chosen by an appropriate potential at time zero [\cite=ballentine] this expression becomes

[formula]

This integral is the initial condition [formula] depending not only on the mean variable α0 but also on the difference velocity [formula]. The resulting initial probability is the quantum analog of initial conditions for particle position and momentum in classical mechanics. This is consequence of the non-Markovian character of the chain since a one-time condition is not sufficient to define initial conditions for this kind of process. This prescription denies the possibility of continuous measurement as observed in the quantum Zeno effect. We interpret eqn[formula] as the rule of initial conditions that defines the theory of quantum probabilities. It displays how information concerning initial velocities are consistently inserted into the body of the theory. The nonlocal character is explicit and is responsible for the persistence of entanglement when an initially entangled state evolves in time. Given this initial condition the probability is calculated as

[formula]

where the transition matrix Π is given by

[formula]

and [formula]. Formally eqn [formula] has the appearance of a non-Markovian stochastic process [\cite=kampen] having y as the noise variable and an associated Langevin equation an = fn + yn that exactly resembles the classical case. Notice that the transition matrix depends on the potential so it changes its functional form at each point in space and may be even non-stationary, depending on whether the potential is time-dependent or not. Besides the trivial case of a free particle only harmonic potentials present a potential-independent transition matrix with a δ-centered distribution. In this case the dynamics is purely classical (in the sense of a difference equation for Newtons's second law) with no fluctuations. Indeterminancies come from the initial probability only. In the general case the particle sees a noise whose distribution depends on its dynamical state. Notice that a feed-back effect between noise and dynamics is not new in physics. In the Unruh-Davis effect [\cite=unruh] an accelerated particle sees a vacuum noise of blackbody type whose temperature depends on its acceleration. Here noise probability depends on information furnished by high order derivatives of the potential at the particle's position. Its functional form is local but, for analytic potentials, it contain non-local information inserted in the function g. Similar effect was observed in the time domain by Mitchell and Chiao [\cite=chiao] where a analytic electric pulse sent thru a low frequency bandpass filter presents a negative group velocity due to the information content of the analytic tail in the pulse. The filter outputs a signal with a maximum in advance that depends of the whole past history of the pulse. Similarly here noise distribution depends on information about the potential existing in the whole space. The physics of this distribution apparently lies outside the range of quantum theory, at least in the non-relativistic case. Notwithstanding additional information can be obtained if an appropriate interpretation of the nature of the stochastic-like chain showed in eqn[formula] is provided. In this the case it is clear from eqn[formula] that Π is candidate for a truth transition probability matrix defining a real stochastic process. Before a closer analysis of this possibility it is worthwhile to see whether an object like the mean velocity makes sense. Immediately we obtain

[formula]

This expression contains an classical mean and a vacuum term with no classical counterpart. Again a rule, here used to calculate non-local-in-time means is defined and must also be included in the body of the quantum probability theory. In this way a protocol may be defined, based only on probabilities and capable of take into account the full range of predictions already possible using amplitudes.

Now we will focus on the structure of the stochastic-like chain displayed in eqn[formula] in order to understand to what extent it may admit an interpretation as a true physical process. It follows from eqn[formula] that the transition matrix is normalized to one. However, for an arbitrary potential, it is not non-negative. Therefore Π cannot be considered a true transition probability as required by for stochastic processes, even though the resulting probability ρN be non-negative. For the common case of potentials that go to zero at infinity and that have even symmetry it is easy to see that the difference [formula] has a range λ which may by put conveniently in the form λ = 2πM, for some integer M. This means the non-local character of the potential ceases after that range and the particle is effectively free. In this case the transition matrix may be separated into two contributions

[formula]

and in consequence it may be decomposed as a difference of two non-negative matrices given by

[formula]

For non-symmetrical potentials the convergence of the integral defining Π is subtle due to its Fresnel-like structure and is dictated by the behavior of the potential at infinity. A more appropriate treatment must be developed in this case, where the range λ separates the integration interval in two regions that results in matrices with negative or positive character so a decomposition similar to the above one follows. Since our focus is stochastic interpretation of eqn[formula] we shall assume that the decomposition Π = T+ - T- is always valid. The initial condition Pi also presents an analogous decomposition Pi = P+ - P- where

[formula]

In any case both plus and minus signed probabilities are non-negative. Each minus signed transition probability ascribe a minus sign to its respective transition matrix so a path with a odd number of minus signed terms adds a negative contribution to the total probability. We interpret this scenario as follows. Define a non-correlated stochastic variable [formula]. To the original stochastic variable y an internal degree of freedom written as [formula] is assigned. Then at slice n the difference

[formula]

is mean value of this internal stochastic variable, for each realization of its external value y. We call w thereality index, corresponding to processes with reality content [formula] or anti-reality [formula]. Each path in space-time has a reality number equal to the product of reality indices at each slice n. If that path has a positive reality number it adds to the total probability at x and if the reality number is negative that path adds negatively to the probability at x. But at each time slice transition matrices T+ or T- act like transition matrices in an ordinary stochastic process. In classical processes noise variables presents only reality content whereas quantum noise variable presents anti-reality content as well. Thus both classical and quantum probabilities admit unified description as stochastic processes in the form

[formula]

and this may be generalized to more degrees of freedom, representing a new class of noise-driven dynamics. This equation proves that quantum mechanics is algoritimizable. A code may be written describing the particle leaving its source, with probability P+ or P-, chosen by a coin toss. A new toss and a reality content is given to a stochastic transition it suffers according a classical Langevan equation, with probabilities T+ or T- just as for a classical stochastic processes. In this way a complete path is formed and the reality number for it is calculated. This means that a quantum stochastic process has 2N times more paths than its classical analogue. The reality number denies any physical reality assignment to a path because the trajectories the particle follows is not defined. The resulting histogram is obtained after a sum of all reality numbers at a given point. Zero probability at some point means that paths with positive and negative reality number compensate each other so in fact the role set of trajectories leading to this point cannot be followed by the particle. This way the reality number defines a topology in the set of trajectories. A close analogy to the Consistent Histories approach appears to exist here. The difference is that here a set of histories of probabilities not amplitudes is considered. Once probabilities have physical reality a Monte Carlo code may be written and the evolution of the dynamics is followed completely, as we can do for simulations using classical dynamics. As stated above a free particle and the harmonic oscillator evolve without fluctuations. But the assumed initial condition, which describes the first motion, also has reality indices so the final probability does involve interference of paths even in this case. It is now clear that quantum qechanics belongs to the class of the simplest non-Markovian processes with memory restricted to a single time slice. Since stationary quantum states do exist a generalization of Markovian theorems for stationary processes should also exist for the quantum probability case.

The reasoning presented here allows us to assert that quantum mechanics is a stochastic process with a noise variable presenting an internal degree of freedom having an internal [formula] symmetry group. This stochastic structure is not evident in the amplitude formalism which gives the probability at some place but cannot describe how it is formed from a more basic processes. Notice the integral in T+ admits a Gaussian approximation near the origin so it describes process with classical analogue while T- is concave at the origin and is compatible with jump-like probabilities. In higher spatial dimensions the formulation presents no additional difficulties, at least for scalar potentials and spinless particles. Here an important issue arises. The possibility of algoritimization of quantum processes allows modeling of experiments with small number of particles where amplitude calculations can give only asymptotic results, for a large number of trials. Accordingly the transient pattern observed in the shot-by-shot electron diffraction experiment of Tonomura, Endo, Matsuda and Kawasaki [\cite=tonomura] cannot be explained by amplitude calculations and could be conveniently modeled by our Monte Carlo code. In this case when the particle hits the screen it gains a gray level, corresponding to the balance of reality number at that point. Only after a huge number of trials do we get confidence concerning the real existence of the particle there, say after a given brightness threshold. Therefore Quantum Monte Carlo presents a ludicrous pattern, changing in time as in the classical case yelding nothing real with certainty. Even the histogram is uncertain. Only the converging histogram, consistent with amplitude calculations is obtained with probability one. However intermediate histograms give additional information. If a particle bright it is there with some confidence even before the complete histogram is obtained. This shows that the probability formalism possesses more information than the amplitude formalism although it may present a more complicated mathematical structure in many situations already successfully treated with amplitude calculations.

The theory treated here is not sufficient to construct a rigorous probability theory but shows that a formal model may be realizable. Its usefulness may be limited by operational difficulties in treating practical problems. Anyway it is possible that the probability formalism be helpful in a better understanding of non-trivial quantum phenomena like EPR-Bell and delayed choice experiments because it treats quantum phenomena using only classical (algoritimizable) logical objects. But more important is the real possibility of the existence of an appropriate stochastic process describing quantum phenomena although it appears that its full justification cannot be obtained within the limits of the simple one-dimensional, spinless and non-relativistic case assumed here.
