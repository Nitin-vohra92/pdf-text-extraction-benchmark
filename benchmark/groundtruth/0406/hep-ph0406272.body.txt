Quantum Mechanical Approach

~  ~  ~  ~  The relativistic mass of a point particle is modified by additional terms which arise from its interaction with a given external scalar, vector or tensor field. However, the mass difference due to this renormalization is irrelevant for present man-made magnetic fields, of the order of few tens of Tesla, at most. Nevertheless it may become relevant in astrophysical objects in peculiar situation for electrons, namely when these particles move within extremely high magnetic fields that seem to be present in special neutron stars, called magnetars [\cite=NS1],[\cite=NS2], which are characterized by magnetic fields of the order of 1011 Tesla. To be more explicit, the effective mass that the electron acquires in such ultra-high fields, is expected to generate observable effects. In order to evaluate the amount of these effects, we shall make use [\cite=KU] of the Green function G(x,y) for a Dirac particle in a homogeneous magnetic field, characterized by a potential Aν; the related equation is

[formula]

Setting

[formula]

eq. ([\ref=eq1]) transforms into

[formula]

Choosing the reference frame with the z-axis parallel to the uniform magnetic field [formula], we have

[formula]

In the impulses space, the Green function can be written as

[formula]

where rx and sy are the internal products between the wave tetra-vectors

[formula]

with pμ and qμ initial and final tetra-momentum respectively, and the tetra-vectors x,y, while d4x and d4y govern the integration in the four dimensions space. Moreover, by making use of the Whittaker functions W, eq. ([\ref=G1]) transforms into

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

The functions Γ(a / b) and Γ(1 + a / b) have zeroes for

[formula]

then, choosing r3 = 0, we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

Take note that the most important poles are n = 1 and n = 2 since higher values are practically cancelled by the factorials. As it will be justified in the next Section, the second term inside the square root is modified as follows:

[formula]

since in the e± example, the magnetic moment is

[formula]

Moreover, the quantity

[formula]

can be considered as that magnetic field which provokes a spin-flip characterized by an energy equal to the rest-mass energy of the involved particle, i.e. 2Bμ = mc2. Hence, combining eqs. ([\ref=meff1]) and ([\ref=mod1]), we obtain

[formula]

for n = 1 and B = 1011 Tesla as typical for magnetars. In Table I we quote a few data of interest regarding both electrons an protons, the latter mentioned for demonstrating how smaller is their influence on the effective mass.

Table I

Classical Approach

~  ~  ~  ~  In this section we consider [\cite=Barut] a mass point charged particle that has an intrinsic magnetic moment [formula] and intrinsic electric dipole [formula] in presence of an electromagnetic external field [formula], [formula]. As usual, the interaction with [formula] and [formula] is

[formula]

where σμν is an antisymmetric tensor built with the components of [formula] and [formula] in the particle rest frame.

[formula]

and Fμν is the electromagnetic tensor. Then in the laboratory frame we have:

[formula]

Let us consider the corresponding action in the covariant [\cite=Feynman] form

[formula]

where α is a parameter. Assuming the intrinsic moments as constant, the Lagrange function becomes:

[formula]

By considering α coincident with the proper time τ, we can easily derive from eqs. ([\ref=action]) and ([\ref=lagr]) the equation [\cite=Barut] of motion

[formula]

under the constraints:

[formula]

Therefore, it is trivial to deduce that the electron rest mass m is modified in the following way

[formula]

The symbol Δ in eq. ([\ref=Euler]) represents a finite term of the mass renormalization, generated by the coupling between the electromagnetic field and the intrinsic moments, which in our case becomes

[formula]

where ±   refers to the two possible alignments between a particle of spin 1/2 and the field lines.

In fact, for such fields and bearing in mind the definition ([\ref=BQ]), the correcting term ([\ref=deltam]) and the effective mass ([\ref=meff3]) become respectively

[formula]

not so different than the value ([\ref=meff2]) found via quantum mechanical considerations.

Astrophysical Implications

~  ~  ~  ~  The electrons move freely in the neutron star atmosphere along the magnetic field lines, but their transverse motion is quantized and the corresponding energy levels, dubbed Landau levels, follow the harmonic oscillator formula

[formula]

Transitions between two nearby levels determine the emission, or absorption, of photons of energy Ec  =  ωc; the detection of these lines represents a powerful diagnostics which provides an accurate measure of B.

If the real rest mass m of the particles, electrons in our case, is replaced by its effective mass m*, as given by eq. ([\ref=meff2]), one obtains a change of the cyclotron energy levels accordingly:

[formula]

The values of Ec≃10 ~ MeV appear to high for the spectroscopical probes of the existing space missions, but in magnetic fields of the order of [formula] Tesla Ec goes down to ≈  1.5 MeV i.e. enters into an energy interval which allows its detection. At this point, we like to recall that magnetars are considered responsible for the X/γ-ray emission of soft-γ-repeaters (SGRs), and possibly of the anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs); nowadays these sources are very few: about ten. We also remind that, despite of the fact that about one out of ten supernova events seems to give birth to a magnetar, the magnetar stage is quite short because of the field decays very rapidly (see e.g. [\cite=Tho] for a review).

Another important aspect, related with magnetars, appears from the detection [\cite=Ibr] of a proton cyclotron line in the X-ray spectrum of SGR 1806-20 in outburst: it gave a direct measure of the magnetic field strength for the first time, namely a field of the order of 1011 Tesla, thus confirming that SGRs are magnetars.

From all the features analyzed above, and bearing in mind that these ultra-high magnetic fields cab be even slightly bigger than 1011 Tesla, we may conclude that, although the mentioned effective mass is negligible for protons, even in the magnetar magnetic field, the simultaneous detections of a proton line in the keV range, and of an electron line in the 0.5-1 MeV band, are capable of providing a direct confirmation of the effect described in this note, based on classical electrodynamics.

Even if not yet feasible at present, accurate measurements of this sort are going to become possible in the nearest future by using next generation space instrumentation.
