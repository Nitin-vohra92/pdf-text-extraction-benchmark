How quantum correlations enhance prediction of complementary measurements

Immediately after the discovery of quantum mechanics, it was realized that quantum correlations between two particles exhibit interesting counterintuitive features [\cite=EPR]. Assuming a pair of maximally entangled qubits S and M, the results of complementary measurements on qubit S can be, in principle, perfectly predicted from two appropriate measurements on qubit M. Later, it was shown that quantum mechanics predicts different values of certain correlations of measurement results than local realistic theories. Inequalities, which have to be satisfied within the local realism, were derived by Bell [\cite=Bell64]. The predictions of quantum mechanics were already satisfactorily experimentally confirmed using pairs of photons entangled in polarizations [\cite=Kwiat95] [\cite=Weihs98]. In this Letter, we analyze in detail how the correlations between the qubits prepared in a general mixed state enhance our ability to predict the results of complementary projective measurements on one qubit when we know the measurement results on the other one. This enhancement can be described by the quantity that we will call complementary knowledge excess. We derive a non-trivial bound on the knowledge excesses which is determined only by the maximal violation of Bell inequalities [\cite=Horodecki95]. An experimental test of this restriction on complementary knowledge excesses was performed using mixed two-photon Werner state prepared by means of spontaneous parametric down-conversion.

We assume a general mixed state ρSM of a "signal" qubit S and a "meter" qubit M. Performing two (ideal) projective measurements ΠM,Π'M on qubit M, the prediction of the results of mutually complementary measurements ΠS,Π'S on qubit S can be improved. Complementarity of measurements on a qubit means that   ΠSiΠ'Sj = 1 / 2 for any i,j = 0,1 (ΠSi,Π'Si are corresponding projectors). Assuming [formula], we can expand the state ρSM in the form [formula], where [formula], [formula] and the meter operators [formula] depend on the choice of the measurement ΠS. In order to predict the result of the measurement ΠS one needs to discriminate between the mixed states ρM and [formula] by a projective two-component measurement ΠM  =  {ΠM0,ΠM1} (ΠM0  +  ΠM1 = 1, ΠM0ΠM1 = 0) on the qubit M. Using maximum likelihood estimation strategy, we can guess for each detection event the most likely result of the measurement ΠS. Our knowledge can be quantified as the fractional excess of the right guesses over wrong guesses in many such experiments repeated under identical conditions [\cite=Englert]. Using our expansion of ρSM, the total knowledge is [formula], whereas without the measurement ΠM, the knowledge is [formula]. The largest value of knowledge over all ΠM was introduced as distinguishability [formula]. Further, we define a knowledge excess

[formula]

where 0  ≤  ΔK(ΠM  →  ΠS)  ≤  1. It quantifies only that amount of the knowledge which exceeds the a-priori knowledge [formula]. The largest ΔK(ΠM  →  ΠS) over all ΠM can be considered as a distinguishability excess ΔD(ΠS). Thus 0  ≤  ΔK(ΠM  →  ΠS)  ≤  ΔD(ΠS). Analogical quantities ΔK(Π'M  →  Π'S) and ΔD(Π'S) can be defined for the complementary measurement Π'S.

Intuitively, for a given mixed state ρSM of a two-qubit system the knowledge excesses are somehow restricted by the properties of the state. To derive a quantitative constraint, we will use the following expansion of the state: [formula], where [formula] stands for the identity operator; ml,nl are vectors in R3; σl, l = 1,2,3 are the standard Pauli operators. The coefficients tkl form a real correlation matrix T and the vectors ml and nl determine the local states [formula], [formula]. There is a subset of the states SM having a diagonal correlation tensor   =  (33,11,22), with the following property 233  ≥  211,222. The local states are determined by the corresponding vectors l and n̄l. Any mixed state ρSM can be uniquely converted to a state SM using appropriate local unitary operations [\cite=Horodecki96b]. Thus, just two orderings of the diagonal elements, 211  ≥  222 or 211  ≤  222, remain to be discussed.

Let us suppose the measurements S and M are constructed from projectors to the vectors of the local bases in which |33| is maximal. Then Δ  =   max (0,|33| - |n̄3|). For 211  ≥  222, let the measurements 'S and 'M be related to the bases in which |11| is maximal so that Δ'  =   max (0,|11| - |n̄1|). Simultaneously, we express the violation of any Bell's inequalities employing the criterion from Ref. [\cite=Horodecki95]: A state SM violates Bell's inequalities if its maximal Bell factor [formula] lies in the interval [formula] (notice also that [formula] is invariant under local unitary transformations). Analogical results can be derived for 211  ≤  222: ΔD'  =   max (0,|22| - |n̄2|). Maximal Bell factor is then [formula]. Finally we obtain an inequality [formula] valid for an arbitrary state SM. The equality occurs for states with zero a-priori knowledges. For such states a non-zero knowledge can be obtained only though the measurement on M.

Now we generalize these results to any state ρSM as well as for arbitrary measurements ΠS,Π'S,ΠM,Π'M, where ΠS,Π'S are complementary measurements. As pointed out, any mixed two-qubit state can be uniquely prepared from some state SM (of a special form discussed above) by appropriate local unitary transformations US,UM acting on qubits S and M, respectively. Further, the transformation of the above chosen measurements S and S to arbitrary (but still complementary) measurements ΠS and Π'S corresponds effectively to the extra local unitary transformation UΠ acting on the qubit S. Since distinguishabilities ΔD(ΠS) and ΔD(Π'S) are invariant under any local unitary transformation on the qubit M, it is sufficient to take into account only a joint unitary transformation ŨS = UΠUS acting on qubit S. For any unitary transformations U there is a unique rotation O such that [formula]. If a state SM with diagonal [formula] is subjected to the [formula] transformation its correlation matrix transforms as follows T = OSO†M [\cite=Horodecki96b]. Thus a joint unitary transformation ŨS can be represented as a transformation of the correlation tensor T = OS, where OS is a matrix of rotation in R3 space.

First, we will explicitly calculate ΔD(ΠS) and ΔD(Π'S) for any mixed state using the transformation T = OS. Assuming 211  ≥  222 we obtain [formula] and [formula]. Then we straightforwardly get [formula]. By analogous calculations we obtain the same result for 211  ≤  222. Finally, since ΔK(ΠM  →  ΠS)  ≤  ΔD(ΠS) and ΔK(Π'M  →  Π'S)  ≤  ΔD(Π'S) we can conclude that

[formula]

Thus the maximal Bell factor represents a non-trivial bound on the sum of the squares of knowledge excesses which can be extracted from a pair of measurements on the "meter" qubit. Assuming ΠM  =  Π'M we can also derive an inequality analogous to that given in Ref. [\cite=Englert]: ΔK2(ΠM  →  ΠS) + ΔK2(ΠM  →  Π'S)  ≤  1. Our analysis shows that for ΠM  ≠  Π'M the unit value on the right-hand side may be overstepped. Note also that [formula] only if the state violates Bell inequalities. For details of the proofs see Ref. [\cite=mamut].

A natural question is how inequality ([\ref=ineq1]) can be saturated. For the class of states with vanishing a-priori knowledges for any measurements ΠS,Π'S it can be saturated just by the appropriate choice of measurements ΠS,Π'S,ΠM,Π'M. In fact, it corresponds to the transformation of the given state to the state with diagonal correlation tensor. It was recently shown that there are such unique local (stochastically reversible) filtering operations FS,FM applicable on a single copy of a qubit pair (F†SFS  ≤  1S and F†MFM  ≤  1M) that transform (with a non-zero probability) any two-qubit mixed state into a state which is (i) diagonal in Bell basis and (ii) has the Bell factor [formula] [\cite=Verstraete02]. Since these Bell-diagonal states have the both local states maximally disordered the a-priori knowledges vanish. Thus - because the inequality ([\ref=ineq1]) is satisfied also after the filtering - we can always saturate it with the upper bound given by [formula] just by an appropriate choice of the measurements ΠS,Π'S,ΠM,Π'M after the appropriate local filtering.

We have verified inequality ([\ref=ineq1]) experimentally for two Werner states of qubits, [formula] (each qubit was represented by a polarization of a photon) [\cite=Werner]. The parameter of the first Werner state (p1  ≈  0.82) has been chosen so that the state was entangled and violated Bell inequalities, the parameter of the second one (p2  ≈  0.45) so that it was entangled but did not violate Bell inequalities. The scheme of our experimental setup is shown in Fig. [\ref=schema]. A krypton-ion cw laser (413.1 nm, 90 mW) is used to pump a 10-mm-long LiIO3 nonlinear crystal cut for degenerate type-I parametric downconversion. We exploit the fact that the pairs of photons generated by spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) manifest tight time correlations. In our setup the photons produced by SPDC have horizontal linear polarizations. Different linear-polarization states are prepared by means of half-wave plates (λ / 2). The two photons impinge on two input ports of a beamsplitter (BS) forming a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer [\cite=Mandel]. A scanning mirror is used in one interferometer arm in order to balance the length of both arms, as indicated by an arrow in Fig. [\ref=schema]. A glass plate (GP), that introduces polarization dependent losses, serves to compensate a non-ideal splitting ratio of the beam-splitting cube (it is about 51:49 for vertical and 55:45 for horizontal polarization). HOM interferometer enables us to prepare conditionally polarization singlet states (i.e., |Ψ-〉 Bell states). The simplest theoretical model of the beamsplitter leads to the conclusion that if one fetches Bell states at the input the only one of them that results in a coincident detection at two different outputs of the beamsplitter is the singlet state |Ψ-〉. However, in case of a "real" beam-splitting cube one must take into account that the two photons strike upon a beamsplitter in opposite directions. So, the mutual phase (at the interface plane) of the horizontal components of the electric-field vectors from the two opposite inputs is shifted by [formula] just for geometrical reasons. Therefore it is the triplet state |Ψ+〉 that leads to a coincident detection at different outputs. However, it is easy to change |Ψ+〉 to |Ψ-〉 by means of a half-wave plate placed in one output arm of the BS.

The mesurement block in each output arm consists of a half-wave plate and polarizing beamsplitter (PBS). It enables measurement in any linear-polarization basis. Behind the PBS the beams are filtered by cut-off filters and fed into multi-mode optical fibers leading to detectors D1,,D4 (Perkin-Elmer single-photon counting modules; quantum efficiency η  ≈  50  %, dark counts about 100 s- 1).

The Werner states were prepared as a "mixture" of three kinds of inputs. First we measured coincidences with horizontal and vertical polarizations in the individual inputs of HOM interferometer (measurement time for each point in the following graphs was 22 s), then we added the results of measurement with two horizontally polarized input photons (this measurement period took 10 s), and finally we measured with two vertically polarized input photons (13 s). The different times of measurement compensated the influence of a glass plate (GP) for the vertical-vertical and horizontal-horizontal input polarizations. The different values of parameter p were obtained changing the position of the scanning mirror. Namely, we have measured at 0  μm and 30  μm from the dip center.

The measurement ΠM on the "meter" qubit was represented by a measurement in different linear polarization bases parametrized by an angle ϑ: [formula] where |ψ〉  =   cos ϑ  |H〉  +   sin ϑ  |V〉 and [formula]. The angle ϑ was set by a properly rotated half-wave plate. Similarly, two measurements on the "signal" qubit, ΠS and Π'S, were represented by polarization measurements in two bases rotated by [formula]: [formula] where [formula] and [formula]. In practice we measured coincidence rates between outputs Π+M and Π+S (it is denoted C+  +), between Π+M and Π-S (it is denoted C+  -), etc. (the first sign concerns the M-qubit, the second one the S-qubit). Then the knowledge [formula] can be calculated from measured rates as follows

[formula]

Analogously the a-priori knowledge [formula] can be obtained as

[formula]

The knowledge excess is given as [formula] The quantities [formula], [formula], and [formula] are obtained in the same way just with Π'S instead of ΠS. The maximal violation of Bell inequalities, [formula], can be obtained by measuring correlation functions for two different polarization bases on each side. Namely, for the Werner states one can choose these bases rotated by [formula] and [formula] (with respect to the vertical axis) on the one side and [formula] and [formula] on the other side:

[formula]

where the correlation function C(ϑ1,ϑ2) is estimated from the measured data as

[formula]

Let us note that for Werner states the theoretical predictions of regarded quantities read: [formula] Clearly, maximal value of [formula] should appear for [formula] (and [formula]), [formula].

The following graphs display our experimental results. In Fig. [\ref=0.8-1] there are plotted the squares of the knowledge excesses [formula] and their sum measured for the Werner state with parameter p  ≈  0.82 (this parameter was estimated from the best fit accordingly to the theoretical predictions for Werner states). The error bars show statistical errors. The accuracy of polarization-angle settings was about [formula]. Fig. [\ref=0.8-B] shows the sum [formula] as a function of two angle variables for the same Werner state. The maximal displayed value of the vertical axis determines the measured value of [formula]. The maximal measured Bell factor is [formula] what is in a good agreement with the theoretical value for p = 0.82 that equals 2.319. The same kind of measurement is presented in Fig. [\ref=0.5-B] but now for the Werner state with p  ≈  0.45. The corresponding measured maximal Bell factor is [formula] (theoretical value for p = 0.45 is 1.273). As can be seen, for the both measured states the experiment has verified inequality ([\ref=ineq1]).

The measurement on the one of two correlated particles give us a power of prediction of the measurement results on the other one. Of course, one can never predict exactly the results of two complementary measurements at once. However, knowing what kind of measurement we want to predict on "signal" particle, we can choose the optimal measurement on the "meter" particle. But there is still a fundamental limitation given by the sort and amount of correlations between the particles. Both these kinds of constraints are quantitatively expressed by our inequality.
