Proximality and equidistribution on the Furstenberg boundary

Introduction

Let G be a connected semisimple Lie group with finite center and without compact factor, and Γ a lattice in G, that is, a discrete subgroup of G such that [formula] has finite volume. In this article we investigate the distribution of orbits of Γ acting on the Furstenberg boundary of G. Recall that the Furstenberg boundary can be identified with the factor space G / P, where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup of G. It is known that every orbit of Γ in G / P is dense (see [\cite=most]). We show that orbits of Γ are equidistributed with respect to the averages over Riemannian balls.

Since we study the action of a nonamenable group on a space without a finite invariant measure, our result lies outside the scope of the classical ergodic theory. The published results about distribution of dense orbits of nonamenable groups are limited to a few special examples. Arnold and Krylov showed in [\cite=ak] that dense orbits of groups generated by two rotations acting on the 2-dimensional sphere are equidistributed. A similar problem was considered by Kazhdan in [\cite=ka] where he studied the action of a group generated by two affine isometries on the plane [formula]. Distribution of dense orbits of a lattice in [formula] acting on [formula] was investigated by Ledrappier [\cite=l] and Nogueira [\cite=no].

Let X be the symmetric space of G equipped with a right invariant Riemannian metric d. Note that X can be identified with [formula] for a maximal compact subgroup L of G.

Fix x,∈X and denote by K and [formula] the stabilizers of x and [formula] respectively. Let ν and [formula] be the probability Haar measures on K and [formula] and [formula] the harmonic measures at [formula] on G / P, that is, the unique [formula]-invariant probability measure on G / P. For S  ⊂  G and T > 0, define

[formula]

Our main result is the following theorem.

For every f∈C(G / P), ∈X, and y∈G / P,

[formula]

Moreover, the convergence is uniform for y∈G / P.

We remark that it was shown in [\cite=em] (see also [\cite=drs]) that

[formula]

and the exact asymptotics of the volume (GT()) = (GT) as T  →    ∞   was computed in [\cite=kni].

The first result in the direction of Theorem [\ref=th_main] was established in [\cite=mau], where the case of the real hyperbolic spaces was considered. A different proof of Theorem [\ref=th_main] is given in [\cite=g_o]. An advantage of the approach presented here is that it shows that the convergence is uniform. While the proof in [\cite=g_o] uses equidistribution of solvable flows on [formula], our proof is based on the strong proximality of the action of G on G / P (see Theorem [\ref=th_proxy] below). This result is of independent interest, and it might be useful for other applications.

Recall that an action of a group H on a compact metric space (Y,d) is called proximal if for every u,v∈Y there exists a sequence {hn}  ⊂  H such that d(hnu,hnv)  →  0 as n  →    ∞  . The fact that the action of G on G / P is proximal plays important role in the study of random walks on G (see, for example, [\cite=furst]). It turns out that a typical sequence in G acts on G / P in proximal fashion.

Let O be neighborhood of the diagonal in G / P  ×  G / P and u,v∈G / P. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

uniformly on u,v.

In the case of the real hyperbolic space, Theorem [\ref=th_proxy] was proved in [\cite=mau] using geometric methods.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th_proxy]

Cartan decomposition

Let [formula] be the Cartan decomposition of G and [formula] a split Cartan subgroup of G, that is, a maximal connected abelian subgroup in [formula]. We fix a system of positive roots Σ+ on [formula], and let

[formula]

denote the closed positive Weyl chamber in A. Then G = KA+K, and a Haar measure on G can be given by

[formula]

where da denotes the Lebesgue measure on A,

[formula]

and mα denotes the dimension of the root space for the root α∈Σ+.

Let ∈G be such that x  =  . Then G = - 1KA+K, GT() = - 1KA+TK, and

[formula]

In particular, it follows that

[formula]

Reduction to maximal parabolics

Fix a system of simple roots

[formula]

Here r =  dim A is the [formula]-rank of G. It is well-known that the closed subgroups of G that contain P are in one-to-one correspondence with the subsets of Π (see [\cite=wa]). In particular, Pi = P{αi}, [formula], are the maximal parabolic subgroups of G and

[formula]

We consider the projection maps

[formula]

Let Δ and Δi denote the diagonals in G / P  ×  G / P and G / Pi  ×  G / Pi respectively. Then

[formula]

Since

[formula]

is a continuous injective map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space, it is a homeomorphism onto its image. It follows that for any neighborhood O of Δ in G / P  ×  G / P, there exist neighborhoods Oi of Δi in G / Pi  ×  G / Pi such that

[formula]

Then for every (u,v)∈G / P  ×  G / P,

[formula]

This inclusion shows that it suffices to prove Theorem [\ref=th_proxy] under the assumption that P is a maximal parabolic subgroup of G. We keep this assumption until the end of this section.

Dynamics on projective space

By a result from [\cite=Tits], there is an irreducible representation [formula] such that the highest weight space is one-dimensional, and the stabilizer of this space is P. We consider the induced action of G on the projective space [formula], and let [formula] be the direction of the highest weight space. The map g  ↦  gw+ defines an embedding of G / P in [formula]. Note that if λ is the highest weight, the other weights of the representation are of the form [formula] for integers nα  ≥  0. We denote by V< the sum of all root spaces with weights other than λ. We fix a K-invariant scalar product on V, which gives rise to a metric d on [formula], which is K-invariant. Put d̃(w1,w2) = d(w1,w2). Let V<ε be the open ε-neighborhood of V< in [formula] with respect to the metric d̃.

For [formula] and τ > 0, define

[formula]

For every w∈G  ·  w+,

[formula]

It follows from the Iwasawa decomposition that G  ·  w+ = K  ·  w+. Thus, without loss of generality, we may assume that w = w+. By the continuity of the measure, it suffices to prove that

[formula]

Suppose that this is false. For a subspace W of V, define

[formula]

Let W be a minimal subspace of V< such that ν(KW) > 0. We claim that [formula]. If [formula] has infinite index in K, then there exist ki∈K, i  ≥  1, such that kiW  ≠  kjW for i  ≠  j. Since all sets kiKW  ⊂  K, i  ≥  1, have the same positive measure, it follows that for some i  ≠  j, [formula] has positive measure. Then [formula] has positive measure too, and for [formula],

[formula]

Since [formula] is a proper subspace of W, this contradicts the choice of W. Thus, [formula] is a closed subgroup of finite index in K. Since K is connected, it follows that [formula]. Then w+∈K- 1WW  ⊂  V<. This contradiction proves the lemma.

We consider the sets

[formula]

defined for T,η,τ,ε > 0 and [formula].

For every ε > 0 and τ > 0, there exists η > 0 such that for every T > 0 and u,v∈G  ·  w+,

[formula]

Note that an element a∈AηT acts by diagonal transformations on V with respect to some fixed basis, and the eigenvalue associated to the vector w+ is at least eη times greater than the other eigenvalues. Therefore, for all w∉V<τ and sufficiently large η (depending only on τ and ε), we have d(aw,w+) < ε / 2 when a∈AηT. Thus, for

[formula]

we have

[formula]

This proves the lemma.

Completion of the proof

By ([\ref=eq_cartan2]),

[formula]

Let ε,δ∈(0,1). Using Lemma [\ref=l_k_e], we choose τ > 0 such that

[formula]

Let η > 0 be as Lemma [\ref=l_last]. By Lemma [\ref=l_a_eta](a), for sufficiently large T,

[formula]

Thus, it follows from ([\ref=eq_gt]) and ([\ref=eq_Ht]) that

[formula]

for sufficiently large T > 0. Therefore, by ([\ref=eq_empty]),

[formula]

for all δ∈(0,1) and sufficiently large T > 0. Since the sets

[formula]

form a base of the neighborhoods of the diagonal in G / P  ×  G / P, this proves the first part of Theorem [\ref=th_proxy].

To prove the second part of Theorem [\ref=th_proxy], we choose a neighborhood P of e in G and a neighborhood Q of the diagonal in G / P  ×  G / P such that

[formula]

for fixed c > 0 and all T > 0. Here we use that Γ is discrete, the space G / P is compact, and the metric on the symmetric space is uniformly continuous. By ([\ref=eq_2]), for every γ∈Γ such that γ  ·  (u,v)∉O, we have [formula]. Thus, using ([\ref=eq_3]), we deduce that

[formula]

Then by ([\ref=eq_1]), [formula] for γ1,γ2∈Γ, γ1  ≠  γ2, and

[formula]

as T  →    ∞  . Now the second statement of Theorem [\ref=th_proxy] follows from Lemma [\ref=l_a_eta](d) and ([\ref=eq_eskin]).

Equidistribution on [formula]

Recall that K is a maximal compact subgroups of G, and ν is the probability Haar measure on K. Denote by ϱ a right Haar measure on the minimal parabolic subgroup P. For a suitable normalization of ϱ, the Haar measure on G is given by

[formula]

We also define a measure μ on G by

[formula]

Note that μ is left K-invariant.

The first step in the proof of Theorem [\ref=th_main] is the following result. Proposition [\ref=p_gg] is a consequence of the equidistribution of translates of K in [formula] proved by Eskin and McMullen in [\cite=em] (see also [\cite=sh] for a more general result). They showed that for every strongly divergent sequence {gn}  ⊂  G,

[formula]

Recall that a sequence {gn}  ⊂  G is strongly divergent if the projection of {gn} on every noncompact simple factor of G is divergent. Note that ([\ref=eq_K]) was proved in [\cite=em] under the condition that the lattice Γ is irreducible. Since the proof of ([\ref=eq_K]) is based on mixing properties of the action of G on [formula], it is applicable to the case of a reducible lattice Γ provided that the sequence {gn} is strongly divergent.

Denote by πi:G  →  Gi, [formula], the projections of G onto its simple factors. Let Ci,j  ⊂  Gi, j  ≥  1, be an increasing sequence of compact subsets such that [formula]. Define

[formula]

For every n  ≥  1, μ(GT,n)  ~  μ(GT) as T  →    ∞  .

It suffices to show that for every [formula] and n  ≥  1,

[formula]

Fix [formula] and n  ≥  1. Note that G = DH, where D and [formula] are normal connected semisimple Lie subgroups with finite centers, and D and H commute. We have π- 1i(Ci,n) = Di,nH for some compact set Di,n  ⊂  D. There is a constant δ > 0 such that

[formula]

We define measures μD and μH for the groups D and H respectively as in ([\ref=eq_mu]). With appropriate normalization, [formula]. Thus, it follows from ([\ref=eq_DH]) that

[formula]

Since GT = KPT and P- 1T = PT, using ([\ref=eq_iwasawa]) and ([\ref=eq_mu]), we conclude that

[formula]

Similarly, H = LQT where L is a maximal compact subgroup of H contained in K, and Q is a minimal parabolic subgroup of H. As in ([\ref=eq_mu_vol]), we deduce that [formula]. By ([\ref=eq_Ha]), it is sufficient to show that

[formula]

Note that with appropriate normalization the Haar measure on G is the product of Haar measures on D and H. Without loss of generality, [formula]. Then by ([\ref=eq_DH]),

[formula]

Let GηT be defined as in ([\ref=eq_last]). Since the set Di,n is compact, there exists η > 0 such that

[formula]

Thus, ([\ref=eq_HTa]) follows from Lemma [\ref=l_a_eta](b).

The map K  ×  A+  ×  K  →  G is a diffeomorphism on an open set of full measure. Since the measure μ is left K-invariant and smooth, for some σ∈C(A+  ×  K),

[formula]

Let GT,n be defined as in ([\ref=eq_gtn]), and it is K-bi-invariant (equivalently, all Ci,j are πi(K)-bi-invariant). Then

[formula]

where [formula].

Let ε > 0. By ([\ref=eq_K]),

[formula]

for a∈A+T,n and k2∈K when n > n0(ε). Thus, for n > n0(ε),

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=l_gtn], for every n  ≥  1,

[formula]

as T  →    ∞  . Thus, it follows from ([\ref=eq_g_gt]) that

[formula]

for every ε > 0. This proves the proposition.

Equidistribution on average

In this section we prove that Theorem [\ref=th_main] holds "on average". In the case of hyperbolic spaces, the following proposition is a consequence of the work of Roblin [\cite=ro].

There exists p̃∈P such that  = xp̃. Then   =  p̃- 1Kp̃, and it follows from ([\ref=eq_iwasawa]) that

[formula]

Without loss of generality, f  ≥  0, and since G = KP, we may assume that y = eP.

Let ε > 0, Oε  =  {z∈X:d(x,z) < ε}, and φε∈Cc(X) such that

[formula]

Since X = P and ϱ is right invariant, it follows that

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Clearly, ψε∈Cc(G) and

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=p_gg],

[formula]

and by ([\ref=eq_iwasawa2]),

[formula]

Denote by δ the modular function of P. By ([\ref=eq_int_P]),

[formula]

The sets {p∈P:xp- 1∈Oε}, ε > 0, form a base of neighborhoods of [formula] in P. Since [formula] and [formula] is compact,

[formula]

Thus, it follows from ([\ref=eq_mu_lim0]) that

[formula]

Since GT = KPT,

[formula]

For γ∈Γ  -  ΓT + ε(), k∈K, and p∈P- 1T,

[formula]

This implies that [formula] for γ∈Γ  -  ΓT + ε(). Thus,

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=eq_mu_lim]), ([\ref=eq_mu_vol]), ([\ref=eq_eskin]) and Lemma [\ref=l_a_eta](c), we deduce that

[formula]

On the other hand, for γ∈ΓT - ε(), k∈K, and p∈P such that d(x,γkp- 1) < ε,

[formula]

This shows that for γ∈ΓT - ε(),

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq_mu_lim]), ([\ref=eq_mu_vol]), ([\ref=eq_eskin]), and Lemma [\ref=l_a_eta](c),

[formula]

This proves the proposition.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th_main]

Now the proof can be completed using the argument from [\cite=mau]. Let ε > 0. Since the space G / P  ×  G / P is compact, there exists a neighborhood O of the diagonal in G / P  ×  G / P such that for every (z1,z2)∈O, we have |f(z1) - f(z2)| < ε. Then for every k∈K,

[formula]

Thus, it follows from Theorem [\ref=th_proxy] that

[formula]

for all k∈K. Hence, by the dominated convergence theorem,

[formula]

Finally, Theorem [\ref=th_main] follows from Proposition [\ref=p_average].

Appendix: volume estimates

In this section, we give proofs of volume estimates, which are used in Theorems [\ref=th_main] and [\ref=th_proxy]. There are other ways to establish these volume estimates. For example, one can use the exact asymptotics of the volume of Riemannian balls from [\cite=kni] (see also [\cite=g_o]). We present a straightforward proof that does not use asymptotics.

Let [formula] be the Lie algebra of the Cartan subgroup A and [formula] the positive Weyl chamber with respect to the root system Σ+. The Riemannian metric defines a scalar product on [formula] and, by duality, on the dual space of [formula]. For α∈Σ+, we denote by mα the dimension of the corresponding root space and put [formula].

The maximum of ρ on [formula] is achieved at a unique point in the interior of [formula].

Since the set [formula] is strictly convex, it is clear that the point of maximum is unique. It is sufficient to show that (ρ,α) > 0 for every α∈Σ+. Denote by σα the reflection with respect to the hyperplane {α = 0}. The map σα permutes the elements of the set Σ+  -  {α,2α} and σα(α) =  - α. Since mσα(β) = mβ, we have

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

and (ρ,α) = (mα + 2m2α)(α,α) is positive.

For T,η > 0, define

[formula]

For every η > 0,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We have

[formula]

where λi's the characters of the form [formula] for some nα  ≥  0. Let

[formula]

It follows from Lemma [\ref=l_max] that for λi  ≠  2ρ and α∈Σ+, δ  >   max {δi,δα}. Thus,

[formula]

where [formula]. Let ε > 0 be such that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=eq_sum]), ([\ref=eq_lambda]), and ([\ref=eq_up]), we deduce that

[formula]

On the other hand, for α∈Σ+,

[formula]

Since

[formula]

This proves part (a) of the lemma. Part (b) follows from ([\ref=eq_cartan]).

To prove part (c), we note that

[formula]

It is easy to check that there exist b > 0 such that sinh (t + ε)  ≤  eε sinh (t) + b for every ε∈(0,1) and t  ≥  0. Thus, for [formula] and sufficiently small ε > 0,

[formula]

where dε  →  1 as ε  →  0+, C > 0, and λi's are characters such that 2ρ  -  λi < 0 in the interior of [formula]. Thus, it follows from ([\ref=eq_lambda]) that

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq_gt]) and ([\ref=eq_low]), we deduce that

[formula]

and part (c) of the lemma follows. The last part of lemma can be proved similarly.
