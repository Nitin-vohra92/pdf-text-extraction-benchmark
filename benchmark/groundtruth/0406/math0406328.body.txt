: We give generalizations and simple proofs of some q-identities of Dilcher, Fu and Lascoux related to divisor functions.

Let [formula] be N indeterminates. It is easy to see that

[formula]

The coefficient of zτ (τ  ≥  0) in the left side of [\eqref=eq:fondamental] is usually called the τ-th complete symmetric function [formula] of [formula]. Clearly, we have [formula] and equating the coefficients of zτ (τ  ≥  1) in two sides of [\eqref=eq:fondamental] yields

[formula]

In particular, if [formula] (1  ≤  k  ≤  N) for a fixed integer i (1  ≤  i  ≤  n), then formula [\eqref=eq:general] with N = n - i + 1 reads

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] with (x)0 = 1.

The aim of this note is to show that [\eqref=eq:master] turns out to be a common source of several q-identities surfacing recently in the literature.

First of all, the i = 1 case of formula [\eqref=eq:master] with τ = m - n + 1 corresponds to an identity of Fu and Lascoux [\cite=FL1]:

[formula]

Next, for [formula] and m  ≥  1 set

[formula]

Then we have the following polynomial identity in x:

[formula]

Indeed, using the q-binomial formula [\cite=An]:

[formula]

we see that the coefficient of xi (1  ≤  i  ≤  n) in the left side of [\eqref=eq:J] is equal to

[formula]

where the last equality follows from [\eqref=eq:master] with a = 0, c = 1, b =  - 1 and τ = m - 1.

Now, with z = i = 1 and m shifted to m + 1, formula [\eqref=eq:AI] reduces to Dilcher's identity [\cite=Dil]: On the other hand, formula [\eqref=eq:fondamental] with N = n + 1 and ai = qi - 1 (1  ≤  i  ≤  N) yields

[formula]

Hence, setting, respectively, z = 1 and m = 1 in formula [\eqref=eq:J] we recover two recent formulae of Fu and Lascoux [\cite=FL2] (see also [\cite=Pr]):

[formula]

and

[formula]
