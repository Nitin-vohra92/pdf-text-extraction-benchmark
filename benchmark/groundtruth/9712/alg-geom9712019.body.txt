On the cone of curves of an abelian variety

1991 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary 14C20; Secondary 14K05.

Introduction

Let X be a smooth projective variety over the complex numbers and let N1(X) be the real vector space

[formula]

As usual denote by NE(X) the cone of curves on X, i.e. the convex cone in N1(X) generated by the effective 1-cycles. The closed cone of curves [formula] is the closure of NE(X) in N1(X). One knows by the Cone Theorem [\cite=Mor82] that it is rational polyhedral whenever c1(X) is ample. For varieties X such that c1(X) is not ample, however, it is in general difficult to determine the structure of [formula], since it may depend in a subtle way on the geometry of X (cf. [\cite=CKM]). This becomes already apparent in the surface case, as work of Kovács on K3 surfaces shows (see [\cite=Kov94]).

The purpose of this paper is to study the cone of curves of abelian varieties. Specifically, we focus on the problem of determining the abelian varieties X such that the closed cone [formula] is rational polyhedral. Attacking the question from the dual point of view, one is lead to consider the nef cone of [formula] or the semi-group NS+(X) of homology classes of effective line bundles, i.e. the subset

[formula]

of the Néron-Severi group of X. In fact, Rosoff has studied this semi-group in [\cite=Ros81], where he gives examples of abelian varieties for which NS+(X) is finitely generated, as well as examples where finite generation fails. He shows:

Considering these examples it is natural to ask if the abelian varieties X for which NS+(X) is finitely generated or, equivalently, for which [formula] is rational polyhedral, can be characterized in a simple way. Our main result shows that this is in fact the case:

Note that, since on abelian varieties the nef cone coincides with the effective cone, the equivalence of (ia), (ib) and (ic) follows from elementary properties of cones and is stated here merely for the sake of completeness (see Sect. [\ref=sect_proof]). Observe that the theorem of course contains statement (2) above, while statement (1) follows from the theorem plus the fact that by [\cite=ShiMit74] a singular abelian variety is isogenous to a product En for some elliptic curve E.

Effective classes on simple abelian varieties

In this section we consider the semi-group of effective divisor classes on simple abelian varieties. We start by stating alternative characterizations of NS+(X) which we will use in the sequel. While these are at least implicitly well-known, we include a proof for the convenience of the reader.

Let X be an abelian variety of dimension n and let A be an ample line bundle on X. Then the following conditions on a line bundle [formula] are equivalent:

Condition (i) certainly implies (ii), since if [formula] for some effective line bundle L', then a suitable translate of an effective divisor in |L'| will intersect any given curve properly. The implication (ii) ⇒   (iii) is clear, since an intersection product of nef line bundles is non-negative. For (iii) ⇒   (ii) it is enough to show that the line bundle A + mL is ample for all m  ≥  0. But this follows from

[formula]

and the version of the Nakai-Moishezon Criterion given in [\cite=LB]. Finally, for the implication (ii) ⇒   (i), suppose that L is nef. Then A + mL is ample for all m  ≥  0, so that the first Chern class of L, viewed as a hermitian form on T0X, cannot have negative eigenvalues. But this implies that there is a line bundle [formula] such that L + P descends to an ample line bundle on a quotient of X and is therefore effective (cf. [\cite=LB] and [\cite=Mum70]).

We show next that on a simple abelian variety the existence of two algebraically independent line bundles already prevents NS+(X) from being finitely generated:

Let X be a simple abelian variety such that NS+(X) is finitely generated. Then [formula].

Assume to the contrary that [formula] and choose ample line bundles L1 and L2 whose classes are not proportional in [formula]. Consider then the positive real number

[formula]

Here tL1 - L2 is considered as an [formula]-line bundle and nefness means that tL1C  ≥  L2C for every irreducible curve C in X. We assert that

[formula]

Suppose to the contrary that s is rational and consider the line bundle

[formula]

We choose an integer n such that [formula]. The line bundle nL is then algebraically equivalent to an effective (and integral) line bundle. But L, and hence nL, is certainly not ample, so that the kernel K(nL) of φnL is of positive dimension. On the other hand, since L1 and L2 are not proportional, nL is not algebraically equivalent to 0, and hence K(nL) cannot be the whole of X. So we find that the neutral component of K(nL) is a non-trivial abelian subvariety of X, contradicting the simplicity assumption on X. This establishes the assertion ([\ref=s_rational])

One checks next that, since NS+(X) is finitely generated, its intersection with [formula] is finitely generated as well (cf. for example [\cite=Zie95]). Choose generators N1k for this intersection. Let now 0 < ε  ≪  1 and fix large integers p1,p2 such that

[formula]

The line bundle

[formula]

is then ample and therefore effective, so that we have [formula] with integers [formula]. Thus, writing [formula] with ai,bi  ≥  0, we get

[formula]

which, upon letting

[formula]

yields the lower bound

[formula]

But, due to the fact that s is irrational, which implies q > s, and since ε can be taken arbitrarily small, this is incompatible with ([\ref=s_inequality])

Classes on products

We study in this section effective divisor classes on the self-product X  ×  X of an abelian variety X. Suppose for a moment that X is an elliptic curve. Then, since NS(X  ×  X) is of rank ≥  3, statement (2) of the introduction says that NS+(X  ×  X) is not finitely generated. The argument given in [\cite=Ros81] revolves around the alternating matrices associated with effective line bundles. Our aim here is to prove by different methods that the analogous statement holds in any dimension. To simplify the proof, we only consider abelian varieties of Picard number 1 for now, as the general case will follow with no effort from the proof of the theorem in Sect. [\ref=sect_proof].

Let X be an abelian variety with [formula]. Then NS+(X  ×  X) is not finitely generated.

We denote by ι1,ι2,ι3 the closed embeddings of X in X  ×  X given by

[formula]

Further, fix an ample line bundle M whose algebraic equivalence class generates NS(X) and let n denote the dimension of X. Supposing to the contrary that NS+(X  ×  X) is finitely generated, our first claim is then the following boundedness statement:

To prove (*), choose a finite set of generators N1k of NS+(X  ×  X) and write

[formula]

with integers bi  ≥  0. Because of [formula] we have [formula] with integers ni  ≥  0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. The equivalences

[formula]

show that there is a subscript i0 with the property

[formula]

If now N is any effective line bundle on X  ×  X with [formula], then it follows (for instance using the Seesaw Principle) that N is a multiple of pr*2M, where pr2:X  ×  X  →  X is the second projection, so that [formula]. In particular we therefore obtain

[formula]

so that (*) will hold, if we take the integer constant c to be

[formula]

Having established (*), the idea is now to construct a contradiction by exhibiting a sequence of nef line bundles Bm, m  ≥  1, satisfying

[formula]

To this end we set

[formula]

where pr1,pr2 are the projections and μ is the addition map X  ×  X  →  X. We then consider the line bundles

[formula]

One checks that with this choice of the bundles Bm the conditions ([\ref=B_conditions]) are satisfied. So we will be done as soon as have shown that Bm is nef for m  ≥  1.

Now recall that an ample line bundle A on X  ×  X defines an injective homomorphism of vector spaces

[formula]

whose image consists of the elements of [formula] which are symmetric with respect to the Rosati involution [formula]. In particular, for an endomorphism f of X  ×  X, the pullback f*A corresponds to the symmetric endomorphism f'f. Let now A = L1 + L2. One checks that, thanks to the fact that A is a product polarization, an endomorphism

[formula]

is symmetric if and only if both f1 and f4 are symmetric and f2' = f3. Therefore the endomorphisms α1,α2,α3, which are defined by

[formula]

are symmetric and, upon using α21  =  α1, α22  =  α2 and α23 = 2α3, one finds that they correspond to the line bundles L1,L2,L3. This in turn shows that the line bundle Bm corresponds to the endomorphism

[formula]

The point is now that β2m = (m2 + 1)βm, so that [formula] is just multiplication by m2 + 1. Therefore, if we denote by Ym the complementary abelian subvariety of [formula], then the differential of βm at the point 0 is the map

[formula]

so that the analytic characteristic polynomial of βm is

[formula]

But the alternating coefficients of Pm(t) are positive multiples of the intersection numbers AiB2n - im, so that Bm is nef, as claimed. This completes the proof of the proposition.

The cone of curves and the nef cone of an abelian variety

Finally, we give in this section the proof of the theorem stated in the introduction. So let X be an abelian variety and denote by N1(X) the vector space of numerical equivalence classes of real-valued 1-cycles on X, and by NE(X) the convex cone in N1(X) generated by irreducible curves. Through the intersection product the vector space N1(X) is dual to the Néron-Severi vector space [formula]. The dual cone of NE(X) is the nef cone

[formula]

which in the case of abelian varieties coincides with the effective cone (cf. Lemma [\ref=nef_and_effective]). The dual of [formula] in turn is the closed cone [formula], so that one of these two cones is rational polyhedral if and only if the other is. By Gordon's Lemma this is equivalent to the semi-group NS+(X) being finitely generated. (See e.g. [\cite=Roc70] for the elementary properties of cones used here).

The idea is now, given an abelian variety, to first apply Poincaré's Complete Reducibility Theorem, i.e. to decompose it up to isogenies into a product of powers of non-isogenous simple abelian varieties, and to apply Proposition [\ref=simple_case] and Proposition [\ref=product_case] subsequently. One needs then that finite generation of NS+(X) is a property which is invariant under isogenies:

Let X and Y be isogenous abelian varieties. Then NS+(X) is finitely generated if and only if NS+(Y) is.

Since this observation is crucial for our approach, let us briefly indicate a proof, before we proceed to the proof of the theorem. So suppose that NS+(X) is finitely generated and that there is an isogeny f:X  →  Y. Thanks to the fact that f* embeds NS+(Y) into NS+(X) and to the symmetry of the situation, it is enough to show that f*NS+(Y) is finitely generated. Let then N1k be generators for NS+(X) and put for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k

[formula]

(The set on the right-hand side is non-empty, since f is an isogeny.) Then f*NS+(Y) is generated by the elements [formula] together with those elements [formula], 0  ≤  mi < ni, which belong to f*NS+(Y).

Consider now for an abelian variety X its decomposition

[formula]

up to isogenies, where X1r are mutually non-isogenous simple abelian varieties and n1r are positive integers. In view of the remarks made at the beginning of this section, the theorem stated in the introduction will follow from

The semi-group NS+(X) is finitely generated if and only if [formula] and ni = 1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r.

Suppose first that the conditions on the factors Xi and the exponents ni are satisfied for X. By Lemma [\ref=isog] we may assume that X is the product [formula]. Fix for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r an ample generator Ni of [formula] and let A be the product polarization [formula]. Due to the fact that the Xi are non-isogenous, we have

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] denote the subgroups of symmetric endomorphisms with respect to the Rosati involutions associated with A and Ni respectively. Therefore

[formula]

is finitely generated.

Now suppose conversely that NS+(X) is finitely generated. By Lemma [\ref=isog] again, we may assume that X is the product [formula]. Note that if V1 and V2 are varieties such that NS+(V1  ×  V2) is finitely generated, then NS+(V1) and NS+(V2) are finitely generated as well. So in particular Proposition [\ref=simple_case] applies to the factors Xi and shows that we have [formula] for all i. Further, if we had ni > 1 for some i, i.e. if a multiple factor Xi appeared in the product decomposition of X, then NS+(Xi  ×  Xi) would be finitely generated, which however is impossible according to Proposition [\ref=product_case]. This completes the proof of the theorem.
