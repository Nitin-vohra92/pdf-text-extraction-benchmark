Chiral solitons from dimensional reduction of Chern-Simons gauged coupled non-linear Schrödinger model

Abstract

The soliton structure of a gauge theory proposed to describe chiral excitations in the multi-Layer Fractional Quantum Hall Effect is investigated. A new type of derivative multi-component nonlinear Schrödinger equation emerges as effective description of the system that supports novel chiral solitons. We discuss the classical properties of the solutions and study relations to integrable systems.

Introduction

Study of two-dimensional electron system in a strong magnetic field is one of the most interesting in the condensed matter physics. In the fractional quantum hall effect, early work by Halperin anticipated novel fractional quantum hall effects due to inter-layer correlations in multi-layer systems.[\cite=ha] Recent technological progress has made it possible to produce double-layer two dimensional electron gas systems of extremely high mobility in which these effects can be observed.[\cite=ex]

One of the most fascinating aspects of classical field theory is the existence of traveling localized solutions of the nonlinear equations describing physical systems. From the quantum field theory point of view, they are believed to carry information about the non-perturbative structure of the quantum field theory. Their particle-like properties have an intuitive and reasonable interpretation as bound states of the elementary excitations of the corresponding quantum field theory.

Solitons made their appearance in a completely different context some years ago, in low energy phenomenological applications to physical systems confined to a plane. An interesting class of gauge theoretical models, describing matter coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field was introduced to obtain a simple realization of interacting anyons. [\cite=JAPI1] The physical reason lies that some characteristic of the model, in particular its fractional statistics, can be maintained by the related one-dimensional excitations and that, by a suitable modification, chiral behavior can be induced. This fact is relevant in the phenomenological description of the edge states in the quantum hall effect. [\cite=RABE],[\cite=WEN] As first observed in [\cite=NOI] a novel and interesting soliton structure is present there, finding its origin in the gauge coupling and in the chiral modification. Our investigation is a extension of the work begun in [\cite=NOI].

We study a family of 1+1 dimensional theories that describes non relativistic bosons interacting with a gauge potential in a multi-component model. We show the chiral excitations which can be seen in one component case. This fact is relevant to describe the edge states in the multi-Layer quantum hall effect. In the multi-component case the theory contains self and inter-component interactions. We show the explicit soliton solutions which describe the soliton-soliton scattering for the inter-component interactions. In the one component case if the theory is modified by adding the suitable potential, the model becomes an integrable derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equation.[\cite=COREA] The solitons are no longer chiral. In the multi-component case even if we add potential, we can not make this model integrable.

This letter is organized as follows. We start in section 2 by describing the extension of Jackiw-Pi model. We show that the system is equivalent to a general family of coupled non-linear Schrödinger equation that does not possess Galileian invariance. In the section 3 we discuss the conserved charges and derive some general properties of the localized classical solution. In the section 4 we compute the soliton solutions and discuss their properties. The last section is devoted to the concluding remarks.

Nonlinear Derivative Schrödinger Equation from a Gauge Theory

A non-relativistic gauge field theory that leads to planar anyons in the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equation, gauged by a Chern-Simons field and governed by the Lagrange density

[formula]

Here Ψk is the Schrödinger quantum field in the k-th component, giving rise to charged bosonic particles after second quantization. Âμ possesses no propagating degrees of freedom; it can be eliminated, leaving a statistical Aharonov-Bohm interaction between the particles. V describes possible nonlinear self-interactions and interactions between components. It can be a general polynomial in the density [formula]. N is the number of components. We notice that the above Lagrangian is invariant under Galilean transformations, due to the topological nature of the Chern-Simons action. When analyzing the lineal problem [\cite=NOI], it is natural to consider a dimensional reduction of ([\ref=eq:1]), by suppressing dependence on the second spatial coordinate, renaming Â2 as (mc / 2)B and redefining the gauge field as Âx = Ax and Â0 = A0 + mc2 / 22. In this way one is led to a B-F gauge theory coupled to a non-relativistic bosonic fields in 1 + 1 dimensions:

[formula]

where [formula] is dimensionless and we have neglected ∂x(B3 / 3κ) since it is a total spatial derivative. In the following we prefer a simpler expression that describes "chiral" Bose fields, propagating only in one direction we choose the B-kinetic Lagrange density to be

[formula]

and the total Lagrange density is L  =  LB  +  L(1 + 1). [\cite=NOI] The equations of motion are

[formula]

with [formula]. Here dot/prime indicate differentiation with respect to time/space. The integrability condition for the last two equation leads to the usual continuity equation

[formula]

Now in terms of field [formula] ([\ref=eq:5a]) and ([\ref=eq:5b]) become respectively

[formula]

The latter gives the electro-magnetic field as a function of the density [formula] while the former encodes all the dynamical contents of the system. In the following we shall be mainly interested in the case in which the potential V is absent: this corresponds to a coupled Schrödinger equation with a current ([formula]) nonlinearity,

[formula]

Note that ([\ref=eq:8]) does not possess a local Lagrangian formulation directly in terms of the field i as the one component case.

Consider the action

[formula]

where [formula]. The equation of motion is

[formula]

The relation between ([\ref=eq:8]) and ([\ref=eq:11]) is the gauge equivalent

[formula]

The current corresponds to

[formula]

Constants of Motion and Symmetries

We look for the conservation laws:

[formula]

where Dj and Fj are respectively conserved density and flux. There is the conserved quantities like amplitude,

[formula]

where Dx stands for the "covariant" derivative ∂x  +  λρ2 / 2. In the case i = j conserved density and the flux become the amplitude and the current respectively. The conserved density in each line and inter-component are only Dij1. The other conserved densities are sum over all components. It is also true in the integrable model as ([\ref=cnls]) which has infinite number of conserved quantities.

Space translation invariance ensures momentum conservation, and the momentum density reads

[formula]

With the momentum density D2 we obtain the momentum flux

[formula]

Here we define Pi

[formula]

Note that Pi is not conserved quantity and the sum of Pi over all components is the momentum density.

Energy is conserved as a consequence of time transition invariance. Evidently the Hamiltonian density is

[formula]

With the energy density D3 there is associated the energy flux

[formula]

Here D2 is not proportional to the current [formula]. Then we present the usual Galileo generator

[formula]

We find

[formula]

namely G, depending on the sign of the coupling constant, always increases or decreases in time. Here we introduce generators

[formula]

In the same way we can obtain

[formula]

where ρ2i is density in i-th component φiφ*i. Depending on the sign of the coupling constant,Gi always increases or decreases in time, too.

The additional symmetry is dilaton invariance which can be seen in the no coupled case. In fact the action ([\ref=eq:14]) is unchanged under a dilation, t  →  a2t, ~ x  →  ax, and [formula].

The generator D of the scale symmetry takes the form

[formula]

where the density [formula] obeys the continuity equation

[formula]

We can remove the last term in ([\ref=eq:xcontD]) proportional to the derivative of ρ2 by adding a super potential to the energy-momentum tensor. In fact if we define an improved [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

The new energy momentum tensor satisfies 23  =  2.

We look for solutions that possess particular symmetries or whose specific functional dependence simplified the structure of the original equation. In our case a simple ansatz is to assume that the density in i-th component is a function only of x - vit. We expect that this choice will allow us to explore the presence of the soliton like solution. In the following we shall be conserved with solutions that approach the vacuum at spatial infinity. This class of solutions is strongly constrained by the symmetry of the problem. Substituting the ansatz into the continuity equation, yields

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

From the ansatz at spatial infinity we consider the case J∞i(t) = 0. ([\ref=ce]) implies that Pi is a function of x - vit. Sum Pi over all components is the momentum density P. The dilation charge takes the form

[formula]

where [formula]. Here we write a conserved momentum [formula] and energy [formula].

Since D is conserved and consequently time-independent we obtain

[formula]

where [formula].

From the ansatz viPi / 2 is a function of x - vit. Here we define the energy density Hi in the i-th component

[formula]

Note that Hi is not conserved quantity and the sum of Hi over all components is the energy density. From the ansatz Hi is a function of x - vit. Then we can obtain the relation

[formula]

where [formula]

To study further properties, we introduce the "center of mass" coordinate

[formula]

This name is easily understood if we think of ρ2i as the mass density in the i-th component. Its velocity will be

[formula]

Here we have used the continuity equation for the current to eliminate the time derivative of the density.

From ([\ref=urgo1]) we can obtain a suggestive form,

[formula]

Being valid for all t, this implies

[formula]

One can show an analogous inequality for the energy. In fact let us consider the following inequality

[formula]

where w is an arbitrary parameter. In terms of the physical quantities

[formula]

with [formula]. The fact that the previous equation holds for all w entails

[formula]

Note that here we consider the case the potential is absent. From the ansatz we can obtain that vCMi(t) = vi. Thus ([\ref=purgo1]) can be written as

[formula]

where we used ([\ref=HvP1]).

It implies λvi < 0, i.e. the soliton is "chiral". If we set λ > 0, it shows that all the traveling waves move to the left.

Explicit solution

The coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (coupled NLS) equation [\cite=Ma] is

[formula]

where use the normalized time and space variables t =  and [formula]. This equation has bright solutions only in all κi > 0. If the κi  <  0 then the soliton solution in the i-th component becomes dark.[\cite=hh] It possesses the famous soliton solution of the form

[formula]

for [formula]. f is a real function. Here we consider the simple case N = 2. The solution which has one soliton for each component is expressed by

[formula]

with

[formula]

pμ and ημ are complex constant parameters related to the amplitudes and position of solitons respectively for μ = 1,,2,. pμ, pμ̄ and η0μ, η0μ̄ are the complex conjugate. Note that κμ  =  κμ̄. Here after we choose the parameter

[formula]

If we set pμ = aμ  +  ibμ, the speed of soliton Vμ is presented as

[formula]

To find the solution of ([\ref=eq:11]) we take the form ([\ref=fg]) so that

[formula]

where ' means differentiation with space and our equation ([\ref=eq:11]) becomes identical ([\ref=cnls]) with

[formula]

The last equation can be obtained using ([\ref=speed]). So that ([\ref=solution]) with the condition ([\ref=c]) becomes the soliton solution of ([\ref=eq:11]). Note that Vi is a speed in the coordinate X and T. The soliton solution exists provided κi > 0; this requires

[formula]

The soliton in all components can only move to the left. Had we taken λ < 0, then the solitons could move only to the right.

We now discuss the phase shifts. We assume V1  >  V2 > 0. In the limit t  →    -    ∞   with η1 and [formula] fixed and η2 and [formula], the soliton solution approaches to

[formula]

which is the 1-soliton solution moving with the velocity V1 in the one component case. Also the other limit t  →    ∞   with η1 and [formula] fixed and η2 and [formula], the result is

[formula]

where Δ1 is the phase shift which is the effort of the inter-component interactions. One can repeat the same limiting procedure but with η2 and [formula] fixed and obtain the other soliton sector moving with velocity V2. This shows that the solution describes the scattering of the chiral solitons.

From the solutions we can obtain the phase shifts

[formula]

where Δi is the phase shift of the i-th component.

Here we change the "charge density" ρ2

[formula]

The equation of motion becomes

[formula]

To find the solution of ([\ref=cv]) we take also the form ([\ref=fg]). Using ([\ref=relation]) we can obtain the relations

[formula]

We can obtain the explicit soliton solution which can move left in the component 1 and right in the component 2, in the case λ > 0.

Integrable Coupled Derivative Nonlinear Scrödinger equation

It is well known that the coupled hybrid nonlinear Schrödinger equation[\cite=h1][\cite=h2]

[formula]

is integrable. These equations are a hybrid of the coupled NLS [\cite=Ma] and coupled derivative NLS equation.[\cite=h3] If we set

[formula]

then ([\ref=hc]) is gauge-equivalent [\cite=WS][\cite=h3] to

[formula]

where

[formula]

([\ref=eqn:GDNLS0]) is the coupled version of the generalized derivative NLS equation.[\cite=Ku][\cite=Ka]

If we set 4δ  +  α = 0, we can obtain the coupled version of Chen-Lee-Liu type equation[\cite=DNLS2]

[formula]

In one component case there is the relation

[formula]

so that by adding an attractive potential with a fixed coefficient (in the case 3δ + 8α = 0) the chiral soliton model can be made integrable.[\cite=COREA]. On the other hand in multi-component case we can not use ([\ref=ur]), then only adding potential we can not make the model integrable.

Concluding Remarks

We have studied a family of 1+1 dimensional theories that describes non relativistic bosons interacting with a gauge potential in a multi-component model. This form was suggested from the dimensional reduction of Chern-Simons theory coupled to non-relativistic matter and it represents a simple way to introduce chiral excitations as the one component case. It can be exactly reduced, solving for Aμ and B, to a bosonic theory with self and inter-component interactions. For this model a local Lagrangian formulation is possible. The soliton structure of the theory has been examined, and it exhibits an interesting chiral behavior. In the multi-component case we can see the soliton-soliton scattering for the inter-component interactions. If we change the density, we can choose the chirality of the soliton solution in each component. Only adding potential we can not make the model integrable.
