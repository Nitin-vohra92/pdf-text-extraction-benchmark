Another homogeneous, non-bihomogeneous Peano continuum

In 1988, K. Kuperberg [\cite=Mom:knaster] found a locally connected, finite-dimensional continuum which is homogeneous but not bihomogeneous. The basic idea of this construction is to use the fact that a local homeorphism of μ1  ×  μ1, where μ1 is the Menger curve, either preserves horizontal and vertical fibers or switches them. This places strong restrictions on the possible homeomorphisms of more complicated continua that resemble μ1  ×  μ1. Since μ1 is homogeneous, the restrictions do not necessarily preclude homogeneity.

In this note, we give a similar but slightly simpler example of a locally connected continuum (a Peano continuum) which is homogeneous but not bihomogeneous. The author found the example after some informative discussions with K. Kuperberg.

Terminology

A space is homogeneous if for every x and y, there is a homeomorphism sending x to y. It is bihomogeneous if there is a homeomorphism exchanging x and y. It is strongly locally homogeneous if for every x and every open U∋x, there is an open V such that x∈V  ⊂  U and for every y∈V, there is a homeomorphism taking x to y which is the identity outside U. Finally, a space is weakly 2-homogeneous if for every pair of unordered pairs of distinct points {x1,x2} and {y1,y2}, there is homeomorphism taking {x1,x2} to {y1,y2}.

The example

Given a closed PL manifold M of dimension at least 2n + 1, let X0  =  M, and for each i  >  0, let Xi be a regular neighborhood in Xi - 1 of the n-skeleton of a triangulation of Xi - 1. The intersection [formula] is a locally n - 1-connected continuum called a Menger manifold whose homeomorphism type does not depend on the particular triangulations chosen [\cite=Bestvina]. The homeomorphism type of μ1M also does not depend on M and is therefore that of μ1, the Menger curve [\cite=Anderson]. The space μnM is strongly locally homogeneous. In general [formula] for k < n. The manifold μnS2n + 1 is simply written as μn; any x∈μnM has a closed neighborhood homeomorphic to μn.

Consider the 21-element [formula] which is a non-trivial semidirect product. The group G is generated by elements a and b with relations a3  =  b7  =  1 and aba- 1  =  b2. It has no automorphism sending a to a- 1. Let W be a closed, PL 5-manifold with fundamental group G. (One can make a closed, PL 5-manifold whose fundamental group is an arbitrary finitely presented group by first making a 2-complex from the presentation, embedding it in [formula], and gluing two copies of a regular neighborhood along the boundary.) Let [formula] be the connected covering of W corresponding to the subgroup generated by b, which is a regular 3-fold covering. Then [formula], [formula] and μ2W have the same fundamental groups as [formula] and W, and [formula] is a regular 3-fold covering of μ2W. Evidently, [formula] has a homeomorphism φ (a deck translation) of order three with no fixed points which squares elements of its fundamental group.

The example X is a twisted bundle with fiber [formula] and base μ1. Specifically, let f:μ1  →  C be a retraction onto a circle C contained in μ1, let X' be a [formula] bundle over C with monodromy φ, and let X be the pullback of X' under f. Alternatively, μ1 has a regular covering of itself of order 3 with deck translation α; let X be the quotient of [formula] by the group action (x,y)  ↦  (φ(x),α(y)).

The continuum X is homogeneous but not bihomogeneous.

To establish homogeneity, it suffices to note that X is a regular 3-fold covering of μ2W  ×  μ1. Let π be the covering map. Since μ2W and μ1 are strongly locally homogeneous and compact, for every x,y∈μ2W  ×  μ1, there is a homeomorphism of μ2W  ×  μ1 which takes x to y and which lifts to X. Therefore any fiber of π can be taken to any other by a homeomorphism, and it remains to show that if x and y are in the same fiber, there is a homeomorphism taking x to y. Indeed, there is a deck translation with this property.

To show that X is not bihomogeneous, we define a horizontal fiber of X to be the preimage of a point of [formula] and a vertical fiber to be the preimage of [formula], where f and g are the projections of μ2W  ×  μ1 onto the first and second Cartesian factors, respectively. By a lemma of K. Kuperberg [\cite=Mom:menger], arbitrarily small subsets of μ2  ×  μ1 have the property that every open embedding into must take horizontal fibers (meaning μ2  ×  {p}) into horizontal fibers and vertical fibers (meaning {q}  ×  μ1) into vertical fibers. Therefore a homeomorphism ψ of X must preserve horizontal and vertical fibers. In particular, ψ must preserve π-fibers, because they are characterized as the intersections of horizontal and vertical fibers.

We claim that if x and y lie in the same π-fiber, ψ cannot exchange them. Otherwise, ψ fixes the third point of the same fiber. The map ψ restricts to the vertical fiber containing x and y. Since it preserves π-fibers, it further descends to a homeomorphism of a copy of μ2W. Call this homeomorphism ψ also. Since ψ reverses the cyclic ordering of a π-fiber over this copy of μ2W, the induced map on [formula] sends a to a- 1. But G has no such automorphism.

Remarks and open problems

Clearly, the 21-element group in the above construction can be replaced by many other finite groups. For any k  ≥  1, there is also a locally k-connected example which is a μrW bundle over μsS2s  ×  S1 for any r,s  >  k. But if r = s = 1, the corresponding bundle becomes bihomogenous.

Say that a topological space is primitively homogeneous if no non-trivial equivalence relation on its points is invariant under all homeomorphisms. (An equivalence relation is invariant if that [formula]. This is analogous to the notion of a primitive permutation group.) The continuum μ1  ×  μ1 is primitively homogeneous and bihomogeneous, but not weakly 2-homogeneous. On the other hand, if one takes a path-connected component of a solenoid (a solenoid composant), removes a point, and takes a path-connected component of the remainder, the result is a topological space embeddable in [formula] which is primitively homogeneous and even weakly 2-homogeneous, but not bihomogeneous.

Is there a continuum which is primitively homogeneous but not bihomogeneous? Primitively homogeneous but neither bihomogeneous nor weakly 2-homogeneous?
