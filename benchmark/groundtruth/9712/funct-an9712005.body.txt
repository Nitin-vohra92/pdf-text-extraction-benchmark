Introduction

The type of norms investigated in this article are generalizations of norms used for the symmetric tensor algebra in the white noise analysis [\cite=HKPS:1993][\cite=Kon/Streit:1993] or in the Malliavin calculus [\cite=Watanabe:1984]. But now more general algebras are included, especially the algebra of antisymmetric tensors (Grassmann algebra) and [formula]-graded algebras (superalgebras) related to supersymmetry and to quantum probability [\cite=Meyer:1993].

A locally convex commutative superalgebra is a [formula]-graded locally convex space [formula] equipped with an associative continuous multiplication having the following property: for any [formula] the product satisfies ab = ( - 1)p(a)p(b)ba with the parity function p, which is defined on [formula] with [formula], and [formula]. Typical examples are Grassmann algebras with finite or countable sets of generators. In superanalysis one considers modules over (commutative) superalgebras [\cite=Rogers:1980][\cite=Jadczyk/Pilch:1981][\cite=DeWitt:1984][\cite=VV:1985b][\cite=Rogers:1986][\cite=Berezin:1987][\cite=Smolyanov/Shavgulidze:1988][\cite=Khrennikov:1988]. It is quite easy to define an infinite-dimensional Grassmann algebra with a non-Hilbertian norm [\cite=Rogers:1980]. But for a long time it was unknown whether the topology of a locally convex superalgebra - including the Grassmann algebra - can be defined with a Hilbert norm, and moreover, whether this norm can be chosen to be simultaneously submultilplicative and equal to one at the unit of the algebra. The paper gives a complete solution to these problems. Our theorems imply a positive answer to the first question and a negative answer to the second question.

General considerations

Let A be an algebra over the field [formula] or [formula] with unit e0. The product is denoted by a,b∈A  →  ab∈A. We assume that A is provided with a positive definite inner product [formula] The corresponding Hilbert norm [formula] is normalized at the unit [formula] We are interested in such norms which allow a uniform estimate for the product of the algebra

[formula]

with a constant γ  ≥  1. In this section we prove under rather general conditions that this constant has the lower limit [formula]

Let A be an algebra over the field [formula] or [formula] with dimension dim A  ≥  2. If this algebra satisfies the properties i)A is provided with a Hilbert inner product [formula] normalized at the unit e0, [formula], ii)there exists at least one element f∈A,f  ≠  0, such that e0,f and f2 = ff satisfy [formula] and [formula], then the norm estimate [formula] is not valid for some a,b∈A, if [formula]

Proof Since f  ≠  0 we can normalize this element and assume [formula]. Take a = e0  +  λf with [formula]. Then a2 = e0 + 2λf + λ2f2 and [formula] On the other hand [formula] and [formula] implies 1 + 4λ2  ≤  γ2(1 + λ2)2. But this inequality is true for all λ  ≥  0 only if [formula]. [formula]

This Theorem obviously applies to the tensor algebra [formula] where Tn is the subspace of tensors of degree n, and the norm is defined in the standard way as

[formula]

with arbitrary positive weights [formula] and w0 = 1. In that case we can simply choose an element f∈T1,f  ≠  0, to satisfy the assumptions with [formula].

Theorem [\ref=Nogo1] can also be applied to a large class of algebras A which can be derived from the tensor algebra T by the following modifications of the product.

The product is generated by [formula] where χ = 0,1 [formula] is a parity factor.

The product is generated by [formula] Here χ is again a parity factor and [formula] is a bilinear pairing.

The first class of algebras includes the algebra of symmetric tensors, the algebra of antisymmetric tensors (Grassmann algebra), and tensor products of these algebras, including the [formula]-graded algebras (superalgebras) used in quantum field theory. The assumptions of the Theorem [\ref=Nogo1] satisfied for any non-vanishing element f∈A1  =  T1.

The second class includes the Clifford product, the (symmetric) Wiener product, the antisymmetric Wiener product (with antisymmetric ω) and Le Jan's supersymmetric Wiener-Grassmann product [\cite=LeJan:1988][\cite=Kupsch:1990][\cite=Meyer:1993]. In these cases the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=Nogo1] are satisfied if there exists a non-vanishing f∈A1 with ω(f,f)  ≥  0. Such a vector can always be found

if the algebra is complex, or

if the algebra is real and ω is not negative definite.

The last constraint is satisfied for the symmetric Wiener product on real spaces, and for the real Clifford system in quantum field theory [\cite=BSZ:1992]. In both cases the form ω is positive definite.

Moreover Theorem [\ref=Nogo1] is obviously true for any unital algebra A, which has a nilpotent element f that is orthogonal to the unit element. If we only know that A has at least one nilpotent element, we can derive the weaker

Let A be an algebra which satisfies condition i) of Theorem [\ref=Nogo1] If this algebra has a nilpotent element f, then the norm estimate [formula] is not valid for some a,b∈A.

Proof We assume again [formula]. Then a = e0  +  λf with [formula] and [formula] have the norms [formula] and [formula] If [formula] we can apply the arguments given in the proof for Theorem [\ref=Nogo1]. If [formula] then we chose λ =  - 2γ, and [formula] is a contradiction. [formula]

Norm estimates for [formula]-graded algebras

In this section we present Hilbert norm estimates for rather general [formula]-graded algebras A over the field [formula] or [formula].. We assume the following structure of A.

The algebra is the direct sum [formula] of orthogonal spaces An. Thereby A0 is the one dimensional space [formula] spanned by the unit e0 of the algebra. The product [formula] maps Ap  ×  Aq into Ap + q for all [formula]

The spaces An are provided with Hilbert norms [formula]The unit has norm [formula] The product of two homogeneous elements ap∈Ap and bq∈Aq satisfies

[formula]

if ap∈Ap and bq∈Aq.

The algebra is provided with a family of Hilbert norms

[formula]

with [formula] The factors wn(σ),n = 0,1,..., are positive weights with the normalization w0(σ) = 1 for all [formula] The weights satisfy the inequalities wn(σ)  ≤  wn(τ) for all [formula] if σ  ≤  τ.

An immediate consequence of these assumptions is [formula] for all a∈A if σ  ≤  τ. A simple example of such an algebra A is the tensor algebra T. Its standard norm satisfies ([\ref=n.1]) with weights wn = 1 for all n = 0,1.... More interesting examples are the algebras of symmetric tensors or of antisymmetric tensors. With the notation [formula] for both the symmetric and the antisymmetric tensor product the estimate ([\ref=n.1]) is satisfied by the norms

[formula]

but it is violated if the factor (n!)- 1 is omitted. The standard norm is defined without the factor (n!)- 1. In the notations used here it corresponds therefore to a norm ([\ref=n.2]) with a weight function wn = n!.

If there exists a constant δ(σ,τ,ρ) > 0 such that the weight functions satisfy the inequalities

[formula]

for values of σ,τ and ρ with σ  ≤  ρ and τ  ≤  ρ, then the product of A is estimated by

[formula]

where the constant γ is [formula].

Proof For a = a0 + a+ and b = b0 + b+ with [formula] and [formula], [formula] with [formula] the norm of [formula] is calculated by

[formula]

The symbol [formula] means summation with the constraint p  ≥  1,q  ≥  1. The sum [formula] has n - 1 terms, hence [formula]. If wn(ρ) is chosen such that ([\ref=n.4] is satisfied we obtain [formula] [formula] For ρ  ≤  σ,τ we have in addition the inequalities [formula] and [formula] such that finally

[formula]

where γ is γ  =   max (1,δ). [formula]

As the first application of Theorem [\ref=Inequality] we derive norms with respect to which the product of the algebra is continuous. In that case the inequality ([\ref=n.4]) has to be satisfied for identical weights wp(σ) = wp(τ) = wp(ρ) = wp,  p  ≥  1. If we fix q = 1 then ([\ref=n.4]) implies p  ·  wp + 1  ≤  δ  ·  wp  ·  w1 for [formula] As a consequence we obtain [formula] The slowest decrease of the weights which might be possible according to our estimates is therefore [formula] The proof that such a solution actually exists follows from the simple estimate [formula] if m,n  ≥  0. Hence [formula] is valid for all p,q  ≥  1. Since

[formula]

also [formula] follows for all p,q  ≥  1. We have therefore derived

If the norm is defined with the weights [formula] n  ≥  1, or with [formula] the product of the algebra is continuous with the uniform norm estimate

[formula]

As a more general class of norms we choose weights

[formula]

with real parameters σ,ρ,s. These weights satisfy the inequalities wn(σ1,ρ1,s1)  ≤  wn(σ2,ρ2,s2) if σ1  ≤  σ2,ρ1  ≤  ρ2,s1  ≤  s2. We denote by [formula] the norm ([\ref=n.2]) defined with the weights wn(σ,ρ,s). The estimate ([\ref=n.6]) and the bounds [formula] if n  ≥  m  ≥  1 and [formula] yield inequalities of the type ([\ref=n.4]) also for these norms. We obtain

[formula]

with a constant δ  ≥  1 if [formula] with [formula] and [formula] or if [formula] with [formula] and [formula].

The generalizations of ([\ref=n.7]) are therefore

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here γ takes some value [formula] depending on the choice of the parameters σ and s.

Moreover, the inequalities ([\ref=n.9]) are valid for [formula] if [formula] or if [formula] and [formula]. The corresponding estimates for the norms are

[formula]

and

[formula]

The value of [formula] depends on the choice of the parameters.

For the tensor algebra and for algebras of symmetrized tensors the Hilbert space A1  =  H generates the whole algebra. Given a (self-adjoint/positive) operator A on H, the mapping Γ(A)e0 = e0 and [formula] for fμ∈H,μ = 1,...,n, and [formula], defines a unique (self-adjoint/positive) operator Γ(A) on the algebra A, which satisfies the relation

[formula]

The norms ([\ref=n.2]) with the weights ([\ref=n.8]) are then easily generalized to

[formula]

If A is an invertible positive operator with lower bound A  ≥  2  ·  id, then Γ(A) satisfies [formula] for a∈An if ρ  ≥  0. This bound and the relation ([\ref=n.12]) imply that the estimates ([\ref=n.10a]),([\ref=n.10b]) and ([\ref=n.11b]) are also valid for the norms ([\ref=n.13]), moreover ([\ref=n.11a]) holds if [formula].

If A- 1 is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator then a family of norms ([\ref=n.13]) can be used to define a nuclear topology on the algebra A. For the symmetric tensor algebra that has been done in the white noise calculus and in the Malliavin calculus, see e.g. [\cite=Arai/Mitoma:1993] [\cite=Kon/Streit:1993] [\cite=Watanabe:1984]. For the algebra of antisymmetric tensors and for the superalgebras such nuclear topologies can be found in [\cite=Kree:1978a] and in [\cite=Haba/Kupsch:1995]. But the estimates of these references are not strong enough to derive the results with a single Hilbert norm as presented in Corollary [\ref=Estim1] and in eqs. ([\ref=n.10a]) and ([\ref=n.10b]).
