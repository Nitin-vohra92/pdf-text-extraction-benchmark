Quadratically integrable geodesic flows on the torus and on the Klein bottle

. Introduction Let M2 be a smooth close surface with a Riemannian metric G on it. The metric allows to canonically identify the tangent and the co-tangent bundles of the surface M2. Therefore we have a scalar product and a norm in every co-tangential plane.

It is known that the trajectories of the geodesic flow project (under the natural projection π,  [formula]) in the geodesics.

Recall that two functions (F and H in our case) are functionally independent if the differentials dF and dH are linear independent almost everywhere.

The set of linear and quadratically integrable geodesic flows on the closed oriented surfaces was completely described in [\cite=BN], [\cite=Koz], [\cite=Kol1], and [\cite=Mat]. In particular, in [\cite=Koz] it was proved that there are no such geodesic flows on the surfaces of genus g > 1 (see also [\cite=Ta]). Linear and quadratically integrable geodesic flows on the sphere were completely described in [\cite=Kol1]. Quadratically integrable geodesic flow on the torus were described in [\cite=BN]. Linear integrable geodesic flows on the torus were described in [\cite=Mat].

The aim of the present paper is to give an other description of the set of the quadratic integrable geodesic flows on the torus and to describe the set of quadratically integrable geodesic flows on the Klein bottle.

First recall briefly (following [\cite=BN]) the description of quadratically integrable geodesic flows on the torus.

Suppose L is a positive number. Let S1, SL be circles, supplied with smooth parameters x∈R(  1) and � y∈R(  L) respectively.

The theorem describes the set of quadratically integrable geodesic flows on the torus.

We would like to suggest one more description.

Theorem 2 will be proved in .

In other words, for every metric G (on the torus T2) with the quadratically integrable geodesic flow there exists a composition covering ρ:S1  ×  SL  →  T2, χ:T2  →  S1  ×  Sl that takes first a Liouville metric to the metric G and then the metric G to a Liouville metric.

How to specify a metric with the quadratically integrable geodesic flow? A Liouville metric is specified by the triple (L,f,h). It is known that the finite coverings of the torus are specified by 2  ×  2 integer non-degenerate matrixes. Two matrixes (A and B) give equivalent coverings if A = XB for a integer matrix X, det[formula]. It is easy to prove that each integer non-degenerate 2  ×  2 matrix is equivalent (i.e., gives the equivalent covering) to the appropriate matrix [formula], where 0 < k  ≤  m. Two matrixes [formula] and [formula] (0 < k1 < m1, 0 < k2 < m2) are equivalent if they are equal.

Thus a metric with the quadratically integrable geodesic flow is specified by the quadruple [formula].

In we describe quadratically integrable geodesical flows on the Klein bottle.

Let L be positive number, f,h:R  →  R be smooth functions such that function f is non-constant and for any x,y   [formula], h(y + L) = h(y) = h( - y).

For every triple (L,f,h) we shall construct the metric G(L,f,h) on the Klein bottle KL. The geodesic flow of the metric G(L,f,h) is quadratically integrable. If the geodesic flow of a metric on the Klein bottle K is quadratically integrable then there exists a diffeomorphism K  →  KL that preserves metric.

. Proof of Theorem 2.

Proof. We have f(x + u1) - f(x) = h(y) - h(y + u2). Therefore for the appropriate constant C we have f(x + u1) - f(x) = C = h(y) - h(y + u2). Let us show that C = 0. Actually, f(x + nu1) = f(x) + nC. If C  ≠  0, then function f is not bounded function. Proved.

Let a metric G on the torus T2 is pseudo-liouville. That is there exists a covering ρ:S1  ×  SL  →  T2 such that the metric ρ*G is given by the formula (f(x) + h(y))(dx2 + dy2).

Consider the standard plane R2 with the standard coordinates x,y. Denote by ξ the action of the group Z  ×  Z, generated by shifts along the vectors (1,0) and (0,L). We may consider the torus TL as the factor-space of R2 by ξ. Since the action ξ preserve coordinate lines we may use the same notation for the coordinates on R2 and TL.

Consider the universal covering U:R2  →  TL that is dual to the action ξ. The mapping Ug:R2  →  T2 is a universal covering or T2. The metric (Ug)*(G) on the plane R2 is given by the formula (f(x) + h(y))(dx2 + dy2). Consider the action of the fundamental group π1(T2) on the plane R2. Since the action is free and since it preserves angles and orientation, we see that the group π1(T2) acts by shifts.

Evidently, the group π1(T2) is isomorphic to Z  ×  Z.

Let the generators of the group Z2 act by shifts along vectors  = (v1,v2) and ū = (u1,u2). Using lemma 1, f(x + u1) = f(x + v1) = f(x) and h(y + u2) = h(y + v2) = h(y). Let us prove that the fractions [formula] and [formula] are rational numbers.

Assume the converse. Then for any positive number ε there exists the pair of integer numbers n1,n2 such that 0 < n1v1 + n2v2  <  ε. Therefore the derivative of f is equal to zero in every point. Hence, [formula]. Contradiction.

Thus there exist the numbers α1, α2 and the [formula] matrix A of integers such that (α1,0) = uA, (0,α2) = vA. Therefore, f(x) = f(x + α1), h(y) = h(y + α2). We see that shifts along the vectors (α1,0) and (0,α2) preserve the metric (f(x) + h(y))(dx2 + dy2).

Consider the action of the group Z  ×  Z, generated by shifts along vectors (α1,0) and (0,α2). Denote by Tl the factor-space of R2 by this action. Since the action preserves the metric (f(x) + h(y))(dx2 + dy2), we see that the metric (f(x) + h(y))(dx2 + dy2) induces the metric on Tl. It is clear that the metric on the torus Tl is Liouville, and the induced mapping T2  →  Tl is covering. The theorem is proved.

. Quadratically integrable geodesic flows on the Klein bottle.

Suppose L is a positive number, f,h:R  →  R are smooth positive functions such that f is non-constant and periodic with the period [formula], h is periodic with period L and even. Consider the metric ds2 = (f(x) + h(y))(dx2 + dy2) on the plane R2. Consider the vectors u = (1,0), v = (0,L).

Denote by s the "slipping reflection" [formula]. Denote by Γ the group, generated by shifts along u, v, and by s. The group Γ acts freely and preserves the metric.

Consider the factorspace R2  /  ξ. It is homeomorphic to the Klein bottle. Actually, since s changes the orientation, we see that R2  /  ξ is nonorientable. Since the action preserves the vector field (1,0), we see that on R2  /  ξ there exists a vector field without critical points. Hence the Euler characteristic of R2  /  ξ is equal to zero.

The metric (f(x) + h(y))(dx2 + dy2) induces the metric (we denote the indused metric by G(L,f,h)) on the Klein bottle R2  /  ξ.

Remark Two different triples can specify the same metric.

Consider the set of triples (L,f,h).

Consider the following operation on the set of triples.

. The proof of the classification theorems for quadratically integrable geodesic flows on the Klein bottle.

To proof Theorem 3 and Theorem 4, we need several lemmas. Let R2 be the standard plane with the standard coordinates x,y, let λ:R2  →  R be a smooth positive function.

{

Proof. The Hamiltonian of the geodesical flow is the function [formula]. Let the integral is given by the formula F(x,y,px,py) = a(x,y)p2x + b(x,y)pxpy + c(x,y)py2. Consider the complex-valued function Rx,y(z) = a(x,y) - c(x,y) + ib(x,y) of the complex variable z = x + iy. Suppose the coordinates (x̂,ŷ) as functions of coordinates (x,y) are given by the formula ẑ = Z0z, where Z0 is the appropriate complex constant, [formula], and [formula]. Let in the coordinates (x̂,ŷ) the integral F is given by the formula F(x̂,ŷ,p̂x,) = â(x̂,ŷ)p̂x2  +  (x̂,ŷ)p̂x  +  (x̂,ŷ)2, where p̂x and [formula] are canonically correspondent to x̂, ŷ momenta. Consider the function Rx̂,ŷ, [formula]. In [\cite=Kol1], V. Kolokoltzov proved that functions Rx,y and Rx̂,ŷ are holomorfic functions of the complex variable z, and satisfy the formula Rx,y = Z20Rx̂,ŷ.

Since function Rx,y is bounded, it follows that it is constant. We shall prove that Rx,y  ≠  0.

Assume the converse. We have {H,F} = 0. Therefore we have

[formula]

[formula]

Since the left part is the uniform polynom in momenta, we obtain the system [formula].

Thus for the appropriate constant D  we have [formula].

If we replace a by [formula] in the formula for the integral F, we obtain F = DH. The last formula contradicts the functional independence of H and F.

For the appropriate constant Z0 the function [formula]. Therefore, [formula] and â(x̂,ŷ) = (x̂,ŷ) + 1.

The condition {H,F} = 0 implies the following system: [formula].

Hence, (aλ)xy  -  λxy  -  (aλ)yx = 0. Therefore, λ = f(x) + h(y). Substituting f(x) + h(y) for λ in the system, we obtain  [formula], [formula], and [formula].

Thus, [formula]. Proved.

Proof. Suppose coordinates (x̂,ŷ) are given by the formula ẑ = Z0z. Suppose Z0 is equal to reiφ. Then, x̂ = r(x cos φ + y sin φ), ŷ = r( - x sin φ + y cos φ). Therefore, λx̂ŷ  =  r2 cos φ sin φ(λxx  -  λyy) = 0. We shall prove that λxx  -  λyy  ≠  0. Assume converse. Since λxy = 0, we see that λxx depends only on x, λyy depends only on y. Therefore, λxx  =  λyy  =  . Since λ is bounded, we see that λ  =  . Contradiction.

We have r2 cos φ sin φ(λxx  -  λyy) = 0. Hence, r2 cos φ sin φ = 0. Proved.

Corollary Suppose λ:R2  →  R is bounded non-constant function, diffeomorphism χ:R2  →  R2 preserves the metric λ(x,y)(dx2 + dy2), and the geodesic flow of the metric admits a quadratic in momenta integral F. Then for any integral F1 for the appropriate constants C0, C1  ≠  0  F1 = C0H + C1F.

Let us prove Theorem 3. Suppose the geodesic flow of the metric GK on the Klein bottle K2 admits a quadratic in momenta integral FK. Consider the simple-connected covering U:R2  →  K2. Denote by G the metric U*(GK) on the plane R2; by F we denote the function U*(FK). Evidently, F is a quadratic in momenta integral of the geodesical flow of the metric G.

It is known that in the appropriate coordinates x,y the metric G is given by the formula λ(x,y)(dx2 + dy2), where λ:R2  →  R is positive function.

Since the Klein bottle is a compactum set, we see that the function λ and the coefficients of the integral F are bounded.

It is clear that representation of the fundamental group π1(K2) is the following: < a,b||abab- 1 = 1 > . We shall describe the action of the group π1(K2) on R2.

It is easy to proof that the action of an arbitrary element c∈π1(K2) is given either by formula Az + B or A + B, where A and B are the appropriate complex constants, and [formula] is the complex coordinate. Indeed, any a∈π1(K2) acts by conformal auto-diffeomorphism R2  →  R2.

Let us show that the complex constant A is equal to 1. First since the action preserves the volume, we have |A| = 1. Secondly since the action is free, we see that A = 1.

Thus, the oriented elements of π1(K2) act by shifts, non-oriented elements act by slipped reflections.

Consider the subgroup < a,b2  >   of π1(K2), generated by the elements a and b2. The elements a and b2 are oriented. Therefore they act by shifts. Denote by ā, [formula] the shifts, correspondent to a and b2. Let us prove that the vector ā is not parallel to the vector [formula]. Assume the converse. Then the factorspace of R2 by the action of the subgroup < a,b2  >   is not homeomorphic to the torus. Contradiction.

Let us show that the element b acts by the slipping reflection with the directing vector [formula]. Since element b is non-oriented, we see that it acts by a slipping reflection. Since b2 acts by shift along the vector [formula], we see that the directing vector is [formula].

We shall prove that the vector ā is orthogonal to the vector [formula]. We have abab- 1 = 1. Hence, bab- 1 = a- 1. Let the element b acts by composition of shift along [formula] and a reflection s1. Since s1b = bs1 and since ab = ba, we have s1as- 11 = a- 1. Therefore the axis of the reflection s1 is orthogonal to the vector ā. Proved.

Using lemma 2, there exists a coordinate system x,y, in which the metric is given by the formula (f(x) + h(y))(dx2 + dy2).

Let we prove that the vector [formula] is parallel to a coordinate axis of this coordinate system. Using lemma 3, we have two cases. 1. The vector [formula] is parallel to an axis. 2. The angles between the vector [formula] and the axes are equal to [formula].

We prove that the second case is impossible. Using lemma 3, we have f(x + kb) = h(x). Since F is giving by the formula [formula], we see that b does not preserves the integral F. Proved.

Thus the Klein bottle K2 can be considered as the factorspace of R2 by the action of the group, generated by a shift along the first coordinate axis and a slipped reflection along the second coordinate axis.

To complete the proof we shall prove that [formula] iff the geodesical flow of metric G(L,f,h) is linear integrable.

It is clear that if [formula] then [formula] is an integral.

Let us prove that for f  ≠   the geodesic flow of the metric G(L,f,h) is not linear integrable. Suppose a linear integral is given by the formula a(x,y)px + b(x,y)py. Using lemma 2, we have

[formula]

Therefore, 2(f(x) - C0)(h(y) + C0) = 0. By assumption, f  ≠  . Hence, [formula]. Then, [formula], [formula]. But since the slipping reflection [formula] changes the sign of the function py, we see that [formula]. The theorem is proved.
