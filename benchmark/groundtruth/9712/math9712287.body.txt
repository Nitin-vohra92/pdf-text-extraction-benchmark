Abstract. We show that the set of injective functions from any uncountable cardinal less than the continuum into the real numbers is of second category in the box product topology.

In this paper, we use a definability argument to resolve under mild set-theoretic assumptions a problem about injective functions in the box product topology. Suppose κ is a cardinal; let [formula] be the set of injective functions from κ into the closed unit interval

[formula]

equipped with the box product topology (basic open sets are just products of basic open subsets of

[formula]

having rational endpoints. For a given countable family of dense open subsets Gn of [formula], for each n, we define a function fn on rational boxes such that fn(B)  ⊆  Gn and the diameters of open sets used to define the box fn(B) decrease as n increases. For each real τ, we define using the fn's an element [formula]. We then take an elementary submodel N of cardinality κ (of H(χ) for a large enough χ) containing the fn's, Gn's, all the ordinals up to κ + 1, and whatever else is necessary. Since [formula], there is a real [formula]. We complete the proof by showing that [formula], and this is done by demonstrating that if xτ is not injective, then xτ is definable in N and hence belongs to N - a contradiction. So the essence of the argument lies in connecting non-injectivity and definability.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main] Let {Gn:n∈ω} be a countable family of dense open sets in [formula]. We must show that [formula].

First we set up some notation.

Fix a canonical family of non-empty open intervals Iρ for [formula] as follows. Let I〈〉 = (0,1). Suppose that Iρ has been defined, Iρ a non-empty open subinterval of

[formula]

, as follows: [formula], where for all ι  <  κ:

[formula],

cl(Aι,n)  ⊆  Bn,

fn(B)  ⊆  Gn.

There is no problem in choosing fn as above, since Gn is dense open and for each ι  <  κ we can take [formula] large enough to ensure that cl(Iρ)  ⊆  Bι.

Finally, fix κ reals {ηi:i < κ}, [formula], ηi  ≠  ηj for i < j < κ.

We associate with each real τ an element [formula]. Define by induction on n, for every i < κ, a non-empty open subinterval Ci,τ  |  n  ⊆  [0,1] and an open box [formula] as follows. Let Ci,τ  |  0 = (0,1) (for i < κ). Suppose that Ci,τ  |  n has been defined (for i < κ) and is a non-empty open subinterval of

[formula]

.

Suppose that xτ is not injective: so there are i < j < κ such that xτ(i) = xτ(j). We derive a contradiction by showing that τ is definable using parameters in N and hence τ∈N by Lemma [\ref=lemma].

Let m0  =   min {n:ηi(n)  ≠  ηj(n)} (we can calculate m0 in N since {ηi:i < κ}  ⊆  N and i,j∈N). It suffices to show that we can define τ  |  n in N for every n > m0. We prove this by induction on n. Suppose that we have defined τ  |  n, n > m0. We show how to calculate τ(n) in N, thereby defining τ  |  (n + 1). Note that Ci,σ and Cσ are definable in N (for i < κ and [formula]) and hence [formula]. Consider Iρi and Iρj: in N, [formula] since xτ(i) = xτ(i) and [formula]. Also in N, [formula] or [formula], so without loss of generality, [formula]. In fact, [formula], for if ρi  =  ρj, then ηi  |  n = ηj  |  n, contradicting n > m0. Since [formula], it follows that [formula] and [formula], and so there is a unique natural number k* such that [formula]. As we can compute k* and [formula] inside N, it will suffice to show (in H(χ)) that:

[formula].

To see this, notice that [formula]. Why? If not, then [formula] for some [formula], and so [formula], and hence

[formula]

(as [formula]). However, [formula], and xτ(i) = xτ(j)∈Iρj, so [formula], contradicting ( *  * ). By the definition of [formula], it is now immediate that ki = k*. Recalling that

[formula]

we obtain ( * ), and so τ  |  (n + 1) is definable in N.

Thus, [formula] is definable using parameters in N and hence belongs to N - a contradiction. It follows that xτ is injective. This completes the proof of the theorem. 6pt height 6pt depth 0pt

Suppose that [formula] is regular and there is an enumeration [formula] of the real numbers such that for every β, [formula] is of the first category. Then every countable intersection of dense open sets in [formula] contains functions which are injective on a closed unbounded set of [formula].
