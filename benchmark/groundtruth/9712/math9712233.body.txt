The Generalized Smale Conjecture for 3-manifolds with genus 2 one-sided Heegaard splittings

The Smale Conjecture, proved by Hatcher [\cite=H1], asserts that if M is the 3-sphere with the standard constant curvature metric, the inclusion [formula] from the isometry group to the diffeomorphism group is a homotopy equivalence. The Generalized Smale Conjecture asserts this whenever M is a closed 3-manifold with a metric of constant positive curvature. All known examples of closed 3-manifolds with finite fundamental group admit such metrics, whose isometry groups are easily determined. For many manifolds of constant positive curvature, [formula] is known to be bijective on the set of path components [\cite=B], [\cite=R-B], et. al.

The Generalized Smale Conjecture is an instance of the general principle, first realized by Thurston, that 3-manifold topology is profoundly affected by the existence and behavior of geometric structures. In the positive curvature case, the Generalized Smale Conjecture suggests that not only the topological structure but also the group of all smooth automorphisms is controlled by the geometry. For (compact) 3-manifolds whose interiors have constant negative curvature and finite volume, the analogous expectation holds true, at least when the manifolds are sufficiently large, since by Mostow Rigidity, Waldhausen's Theorem, and work of Hatcher discussed below, the composition [formula] is a homotopy equivalence. In contrast, when the manifold has interior of constant negative curvature and infinite volume, or has constant zero curvature, a diffeomorphism will not in general be isotopic to an isometry (said differently, the diffeomorphism group may have more components than the isometry group). Even in these cases, however, Waldhausen's Theorem and Hatcher's work show that [formula] is always a homotopy equivalence when one restricts to the connected components of the identity diffeomorphism.

Our approach to the Generalized Smale Conjecture, for the cases we will consider here, is based on work of Hatcher as extended by Ivanov. For sufficiently large [formula]-irreducible 3-manifolds, Hatcher ([\cite=H2], combined with [\cite=H1]), extending earlier work of Laudenbach [\cite=L], proved that the components of [formula] are contractible. The main part of the argument is to show that the space of imbeddings of a 2-sided incompressible surface F that are disjoint from a parallel copy of F is a deformation retract of the space of all imbeddings of F (isotopic to the inclusion relative to ∂F).

For manifolds that are not sufficiently large and therefore do not contain a 2-sided incompressible surface, one may try to use a 1-sided incompressible surface instead. If M is orientable, irreducible, and not sufficiently large, and contains a 1-sided incompressible surface K, then by theorem 4 of [\cite=R1], M - K is an open handlebody. When the complement of a 1-sided surface K in M is an open handlebody, we say that (M,K) is a 1-sided Heegaard splitting. The genus of the splitting is the (nonorientable) genus of K. Ivanov [\cite=I1], [\cite=I2] extended Hatcher's results to a restricted class of 3-manifolds with genus 2 1-sided Heegaard splittings, enabling him to determine the homotopy type of their diffeomorphism groups. In particular, the Generalized Smale Conjecture is implied for these manifolds.

The manifolds considered by Ivanov are those for which no Seifert fibering is nonsingular on the complement of any vertical Klein bottle. The remaining cases are:

Those for which every Seifert fibering nonsingular on the complement of K restricts to the "meridinal" (nonsingular) fibering of K. These have binary dihedral fundamental groups.

Those for which every Seifert fibering nonsingular on the complement of K restricts to the "longitudinal" (two exceptional fibers) fibering of K. These are the lens spaces [formula].

The lens space L(4,1) (which admits both meridinal and longitudinal fiberings nonsingular on the complement of K).

In this paper, we prove the Conjecture for cases I and II. More precise statements and an outline of the argument will be given in section [\ref=results], after fixing notation.

Ivanov's announced results were used in [\cite=F-W] to construct examples of homeomorphisms of reducible 3-manifolds that are homotopic but not isotopic. Our results show that their construction applies to a larger class of 3-manifolds. In [\cite=P-R], our work was applied to the classification problem for 3-manifolds which have metrics of positive Ricci curvature and universal cover S3.

The Generalized Smale Conjecture has attracted the interest of physicists studying the theory of quantum gravity. Certain physical configuration spaces can be realized as the quotient space of a principal [formula]-bundle with contractible total space, where [formula] denotes the subspace of [formula] that induce the identity on the tangent space to M at x0. (This group is homotopy equivalent to [formula].) Consequently the loop space of the configuration space is weakly homotopy equivalent to [formula]. Physical significance of [formula] for quantum gravity was first pointed out in [\cite=F-S]. See also [\cite=ABBJRS], [\cite=G-L], [\cite=I], [\cite=S3], [\cite=W2]. The significance of some higher homotopy groups of [formula] is examined in [\cite=Giulini].

An earlier version of this paper was circulated in the late 1980's, and indeed has been cited a number of times in the scientific literature. In this new version, the essential mathematical content is unchanged, but a considerable amount of detail has been added. Also, various "folk" theorems about fibrations of spaces of diffeomorphisms and imbeddings, heavily used in our arguments, have been put on firm ground by the work in [\cite=Kalliongis-McCullough].

Notation and statement of results

Let K be a Klein bottle and let P be the orientable I-bundle over K with boundary the torus T. Let R be a solid torus containing a meridinal 2-disc whose boundary C is a meridinal circle lying in ∂R. Fix a presentation π1(K)   =   〈  a,  b    |    b- 1ab   =   a- 1  〉. The four homotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on K are b, ab, a, and b2, with b and ab orientation-reversing and a and b2 orientation-preserving. The free abelian group π1(∂P) is generated by (loops homotopic in P to) a and b2. For a pair (m,n) of relatively prime integers, the 3-manifold M(m,n) is formed by identifying ∂R and ∂P in such a way that C is attached along a simple closed curve representing the element amb2n. Since M( - m,n)   =   M(m,n) and M( - m, - n)   =   M(m,n), we can and always will assume that both m and n are positive. The fundamental group of M(m,n) has presentation 〈  a,  b    |    b- 1ab   =   a- 1,  amb2n   =   1  〉.

From [\cite=R2] we have the following facts. If m   =   1, then M(1,n) is the lens space L(4n,2n - 1). Suppose that [formula]. If m is even, then [formula], the direct product of the binary dihedral group D*4m   =   〈x,y  |  x2   =   (xy)2   =   y2m  〉 and a cyclic group. Finally, if m > 1 is odd, write 4n   =   2kn1 where n1 is odd. Then [formula] where D(2k,m) is the generalized dihedral group 〈  x,y  |  x2k   =   ym   =   1,  x- 1yx   =   y- 1  〉. Note that when m is odd, there is an isomorphism from D*4m to D(4,m) given by sending x to x and y to yx2.

In [\cite=I1], it was announced that for [formula], the inclusion [formula] is a homotopy equivalence, and a detailed proof for the case [formula] and [formula] was given in [\cite=I2]. In the remaining sections of this paper, we will prove this result for the cases where [formula] or [formula], except for that of m   =   n   =   1, where M(1,1)   =   L(4,1). In section [\ref=isometry], we compute the isometry groups of the M(m,n). In section [\ref=mainthms], we reduce the Conjecture in the case of the M(m,n) to proving that the inclusion from the space of fiber-preserving imbeddings of K into M to the space of all imbeddings is a weak homotopy equivalence on the connected components of the inclusion. That is, a parameterized family {Kt}t∈Dk of imbedded Klein bottles isotopic to K can be deformed to a fiber-preserving family. The proof of this assertion occupies the final two sections. In contrast to the 2-sided case, one cannot avoid parameters for which Kt intersects K non-transversely and these configurations must be analyzed, but it is enough to consider "generic position" non-transverse configurations, as described in [\cite=I2]. For these we show in theorem [\ref=circles] that for each parameter value t one can find a concentric fibered torus Tu in a neighborhood of K which meets Kt transversely in circles that are either inessential in Tu or cover imbedded circles in Kt. In section [\ref=parameterization], we complete the argument, using the methods of Hatcher to eliminate inessential intersections with the concentric solid tori in M - K, then deforming the Kt to be fiber-preserving inductively over the skeleta of a triangulation of the parameter space.

This program fails in a fundamental way in the case of L(4,1) because no Seifert fibering of L(4,1) is preserved by all isometries. Below we will point out more precisely the steps where the arguments break down.

Calculation of isometry groups

The finite subgroups of [formula] that act freely on S3 were worked out by Hopf and Seifert-Threlfall, and reformulated using quaternions by Hattori. We review this as described in [\cite=Wolf] (see especially pp. 226-227). There is a quotient map [formula], where [formula] can be identified with the group of unit quaternions, and F(a,b) acts on [formula] by F(a,b)(q)   =   aqb- 1. The kernel of F is W   =   {(1,1),( - 1, - 1)}. The center of [formula] has order 2, and is generated by
