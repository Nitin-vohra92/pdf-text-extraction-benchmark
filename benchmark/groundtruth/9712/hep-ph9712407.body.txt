Radiative Corrections to Moller Scattering of Polarized Particles

Introduction

For a wide serie of experiments in SLAC (E-142,E-143,E-154,E-155), it is neccesary to know the polarization of electron beam. For this aim a single arm Moller polarimeter is utilized. In order to extract (with desirable accuracy) beam polarization pb we need to calculate theoretically, taking into account the experimental conditions, the quantities σth and Ath - theoretical meaning of cross section (CS) and polarization asymmetry. If the experimental data for polarization asymmetry (Ameas) and target polarization (pt) are known, the ratio

[formula]

allows to find the polarization of electron beam.

Method of Calculation

The Moller (e- + e-  →  e- + e-) scattering CS of order O(α3) can be written in the form (within the QED treatment)

[formula]

where each [formula], and [formula], where E(E') is the energy of the initial (scattered) electron. σo is the Born (non radiative) contribution of order O(α2). σV is the contribution of the diagrams with an additional virtual photon (V-contribution). It is constitued by contributions of vacuum polarization (sum over all generations of leptons and quarks), vertex renormalization and two-photon exchange diagrams. σR is the contribution of nonobservable (internal bremsstrahlung) photon radiation (R-contribution). σR can be divided into three parts: σFR is finite when k  →  0 (k is the photon momentum), σH is the contribution of "hard photons", and it is also finite, and σS is the contribution of "soft photons". The latter contains infrared divergences. All σFR, σH and σS may be calculated in a standard way (see, for example, [\cite=BS]-[\cite=BaSh]). According to the method of [formula], the infrared divergence vanishes when the infrared divergent part of σV (denoted as δλV , see, for example, [\cite=BS]) is summed with the infrared divergent part of σR (denoted as δRλ, see, for example, [\cite=BS]).

As it is wellknown, the linear, exchangable and interfering diagrams give contribution to Moller scattering. For this reason the expression for differential cross section and polarization asymmetry are presented as a sum of three parts:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where l=l,e,i. In our calculations the differential cross section is presented as

[formula]

where σo  =  σuo  +  σpo, and σu,po are the spin-independent and spin-dependent Born contributions. δvert and δvac are the spin-independent finite factorized contributions of vertex and vacuum polarization corrections. σu,pamm are the spin-independent and spin-dependent contributions attributed to anomalous magnetic momentum. δu,p2γ are the spin-independent and spin-dependent corrections due to two-photon exchange. δk can be written in a standard way. For references see [\cite=Kah]. σF,u,pR are the spin-independent and spin-dependent cotributions of infrared free part of R-contribution. δl, δs δH1 and δλ are spin-independent factorized corrections derived from the infrared divergent vertex contribution, finite "soft-photon" contribution, finite "hard-photon" contribution and the sum of infrared divergent parts in R and V contributions (δλ). σH2,u and σH2,p are the spin-independent and spin-dependent corrections of infrared free part of hard-photon contribution. All contributions are defined in a standard way, (see, for example, references [\cite=BS] [\cite=Kah]).

The longitudinal and transversal polarization asymmetries are, usually, defined as

[formula]

and

[formula]

The arrows show the polarization of the beam and the target, respectively. The corrected polarization asymmetry is presented as

[formula]

where Ao is the Born asymmetry, and [formula] or [formula]. σpamm and σuamm are the spin-dependent and spin-independent contributions due to anomalous magnetic momentum. (σuoσpR  -  σpoσuR) / (σuo)2 is due to R-contribution. Where σuR  =  σF,uR  +  σH2,u and σpR  =  σF,pR  +  σH2,p.

The radiative correction to asymmetry is defined as

Results

In this section the results of calculations of polarization asymmetry both for longitudinally and transversally polarized target and radiative corrections to asymmetry are presented. Numerical calculations have been carried out with the help of FORTRAN code created by the authors. For analytical calculations REDUCE code has been utilized. Graphics for asymmetries and radiative corrections can be seen in figures 1-4. Obtained results are presented in table 1.

Conclusions

The calculation of the differential cross section and polarization asymmetry to Moller scattering will in the future allow to find beam polarization. For this aim it is neccesary to measure polarization asymmetry with high accuracy. Iteration procedure for theoretical calculation of polarization asymmetry can be improved, and that will lead to the increase of the accuracy when beam polarization is measured. As we can see, the corrections without cuts are very large (in any ocasion about 20%), although they will be considerably reduced when the experimental cuts will be taken into account. Analysis of the corrected polarization asymmetries in the case of longitudinally and transversally polarized targets show that in a wide kinematical range corrections are considerable. In this paper the results of calculations of differencial cross section and polarization asymmetry have been presented taking into account only the contribution of linear diagrams. Results, in which the contribution of exchangable and interfering diagrams are considered will be presented in the future. For a more accurate calculation of polarization asymmetry it is neccesary to utilize a Monte Carlo generator for Moller scattering, and the contribution of correction due to external radiation of beam particles within the target must be taken into account. This is an object for future investigations.
