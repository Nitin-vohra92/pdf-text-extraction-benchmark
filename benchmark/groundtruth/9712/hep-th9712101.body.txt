Introduction

Recently, one of us has proposed a consistent, relativistic theory of the classical Maxwell field interacting with classical, charged, point-like particles (cf. [\cite=EMP]). For this purpose an "already renormalized" formula for the total four-momentum of a system composed of both the moving particles and the surrounding electromagnetic field was used. It was proved, that the conservation of the total four-momentum defined by this formula is equivalent to a certain boundary condition for the behaviour of the Maxwell field in the vicinity of the particle trajectories. Without this condition, Maxwell theory with point-like sources is not dynamically closed: initial conditions for particles and fields do not imply the evolution of the system because the particle trajectories can be arbitrarily chosen and then the initial-value-problem for the field can be solved. The condition, called fundamental equation, added to Maxwell equations, provides the missing dynamical equation: now, particles trajectories cannot be chosen arbitrarily and initial data uniquely imply the future and the past evolution of the composed "particles + fields" system.

Physically, the "already renormalized" formula for the total four-momentum was suggested by a suitable approximation procedure applied to an extended-particle model. In such a model we suppose that the particle is a stable, soliton-like solution of a hypothetical fundamental theory of interacting electromagnetic and matter fields. We assume that this hypothetical theory tends asymptotically to the linear Maxwell electrodynamics, in the weak field regime (i.e. for weak electromagnetic fields and "almost vanishing" matter fields). This means, that "outside of the particles" the entire theory reduces to Maxwell electrodynamics. Starting from this model, a formula was found, which gives in a good approximation the total four-momentum of the system composed of both the moving (extended) particles and the surrounding electromagnetic field. This formula uses only the "mechanical" information about the particle (position, velocity, mass m and the electric charge e) and the free electromagnetic field outside of the particle. It turns out, that this formula does not produce any infinities when applied to the case of point particles, i.e. it is "already renormalized". We take it as a starting point for a mathematically self-consistent theory of point-like particles interacting with the linear Maxwell field. The "fundamental equation" of the theory is precisely the conservation of the total four momentum of the system "particles + fields", defined by this formula.

At this point a natural idea arises, to construct a "second-generation" theory, which approximates better the real properties of an extended particle, and takes into account also possible deformations of its interior, due to strong external field. A possible description of such a deformation would consist in taking into account a possible polarization of the particle, i.e. generation of an electric dipole.

The goal of this paper is to illustrate this phenomenon on a simple, physical model of the "internal non-linearity", namely the Born-Infeld non-linear electrodynamics.

The mathematical mechanism responsible for such a polarizability would be following. Given a particular model of the matter fields interacting with electromagnetism, the "particle at rest"-solution corresponds to a minimum of the total field energy. It is, therefore, described by a solution of a system of elliptic equations (Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the total Hamiltonian of the hypothetical fundamental theory of interacting matter fields and electromagnetic field). This solution corresponds to the vanishing boundary conditions at infinity. Physical situation "particle in a non-vanishing external field" corresponds to the solution of the same elliptic problem with constant, non-vanishing boundary conditions [formula] at infinity. Far away from the particle, such a solution is again a solution of the free Maxwell equations. With respect to the unperturbed situation, it may contain additional multipole moments. For weak perturbations, the relation between the dipole moment [formula] created this way and the external field [formula] is expected to be linear (in the first approximation):

[formula]

and the coefficient κ describes the "deformability" of the particle, due to non-linear character of the interaction of the matter fields (constituents of the particle) with the electromagnetic field.

The coefficient κ arises, therefore, similarly as "reflection" or "transmission" coefficients in the scattering theory. Constant field and the dipole solution are two independent solutions of the second order, linear equations describing the free Maxwell field surrounding the particle. Outside of the particle they may be mixed in an arbitrary proportion. Such an arbitrary mixture is no longer possible if it has to match an exact solution of non-linear equations describing the interior of the particle.

In the present paper we assume that the exterior of the unperturbed particle is described by the spherically symmetric, static solution of non-linear Born-Infeld electrodynamics with a δ-like source. For any value of [formula] we find explicitly the two-dimensional family of all the dipole-like perturbations of the above solution. They all behave correctly at r  →    ∞  . For r  →  0, however, there is one perturbation which remains regular, and another one which increases faster then the unperturbed solution. The variation of the total field energy due to the latter perturbation is infinite, which we consider as an unphysical feature. We conclude that all the physically admissible perturbations are proportional to the one which is regular at 0. At r  →    ∞   this solution behaves as a mixture of the constant field [formula] and the dipole solution. We calculate the ratio between these two ingredients and we interpret it as the polarizability coefficient of the Born-Infeld particle.

Perturbations of the Born-Infeld particle

The Born-Infeld electrodynamics [\cite=BI] (see also [\cite=IBB]) is defined by the following Lagrangian

[formula]

where the Lorentz invariants [formula] and [formula] are built of the components [formula] and [formula] of the electromagnetic field fμν, defined in a standard way via a four-potential vector. The parameter "b" has a dimension of a field strength (Born and Infeld called it the absolute field, cf. [\cite=BI]) and it measures the nonlinearity of the theory. In the limit b  →    ∞   the Lagrangian LBI tends to the standard Maxwell Lagrangian

[formula]

Field equations derived from ([\ref=Lag-BI]) have the same form as Maxwell equations derived from ([\ref=Lag-Max]), but the relation between fields (E,B) and (D,H) is now highly nonlinear:

[formula]

The above formulae are responsible for the nonlinear character of the Born-Infeld theory. In the limit b  →    ∞   we obtain linear Maxwell relations: [formula] and [formula] (we use the Heaviside-Lorentz system of units).

Now, consider a point-like, Born-Infeld charged particle at rest. It is described by the static solution of the Maxwell field equations with [formula] and [formula], where e denotes the particle's electric charge. Obviously [formula] (Born-Infeld electrostatics). Moreover, the spherically symmetric solution of [formula] is given by the Coulomb formula

[formula]

Using ([\ref=D]) one easily finds the corresponding [formula] field

[formula]

where [formula] (note, that the field [formula], contrary to [formula], is bounded in the vicinity of the particle. It implies that the energy of a point charge is already finite).

Consider a perturbation [formula] of the static Born-Infeld solution [formula], where [formula] is weak perturbation ([formula]). The corresponding expansion [formula], where [formula] denotes terms vanishing for [formula] like [formula] or faster and

[formula]

is the linear perturbation may be obtained from ([\ref=D]). Due to Maxwell equations we have: [formula] i.e. [formula]. Therefore, using ([\ref=perturb-D]), equation [formula] implies:

[formula]

where Δ stands for a 3-dimensional Laplace operator in [formula] (in the limit r0  →  0 we obtain simply the Laplace equation [formula] for the electrostatic potential [formula]). Using spherical coordinates in [formula] the Laplace operator Δ may be decomposed into radial derivatives and the Laplace-Beltrami operator [formula] on the unit sphere. Using also the multipole expansion for the value of [formula] on each sphere {r  =  const} we see, that due to the spherical symmetry of the unperturbed solution [formula], different multipole modes decouple in the above equation. Let us, therefore, concentrate on the dipole-like deformations, i.e. on solutions of the type:

[formula]

where Ek is constant. Obviously, [formula]. Inserting the above ansatz to ([\ref=tilde-phi]) we obtain:

[formula]

where Ψ' stands for ∂Ψ  /  ∂r. Equation ([\ref=Psi]) may be explicitly solved (see Section 3).

For r  ≫  r0, equation ([\ref=tilde-phi]) reduces to the standard Laplace equation with 2 independent dipole-like solutions: the constant one and the external dipole solution. Correspondingly, there is a solution Ψ1 of ([\ref=Psi]) which is constant at infinity and a solution Ψ2 which behaves like r- 3 at infinity. They can be chosen as a basis in the space of solutions and any other solution is of the form

[formula]

On the other hand, a basis may be chosen corresponding to the behaviour of Ψ at r  →  0. There is a solution Ψ3, which is bounded (it behaves like r4) and another one, say Ψ4, which behaves like r- 1. Correspondingly, any solution may be also represented as a combination

[formula]

Physical assumptions impose condition D  =  0, because otherwise the "perturbation" [formula] would become infinite. Such a behaviour contradicts the universal condition [formula], implied by equation ([\ref=D]) and proves that the corresponding solution is merely an artefact of the linearization. Moreover, it leads to an infinite variation of the total field energy (see Section 3). This reduces the space of possible solutions to one dimesion and imposes the linear relation between the coefficients A and B in the representation ([\ref=solution2]), because we have

[formula]

Hence, we may define the "deformability coefficient":

[formula]

equal to the ratio between the dipole moment [formula] generated by the external field [formula] and the field itself. Using condition ([\ref=solution]) and its derivative at some fixed point r0, we easily eliminate the arbitrary variable C and obtain the following result:

[formula]

In the next Section we show that

[formula]

Obviously, in the limit of Maxwell theory (r0  →  0), the external electric field does not generate any particle's dipole moment. Therefore, this mechanism comes entirely from the non-linearity of the Born-Infeld theory.

Exact solutions of the linearized Born-Infeld electrostatics

To find solution Ψ1 let us introduce the variable [formula]. Then equation ([\ref=Psi]) reduces to the hypergeometric equation (see e.g. [\cite=Watson]):

[formula]

Its regular solution is given by

[formula]

where F(a,b,c,z) denotes a hypergeometric function (cf. [\cite=Watson]).

To find Ψ2 let us define a function Φ2: = r3Ψ2. Note, that Φ2 is constant at infinity. The equation ([\ref=Psi]) rewritten in terms of Φ2 also reduces to the hypergeometric equation in the variable "z". Its regular solution reads:

[formula]

Another way to parameterize the space of solution of ([\ref=Psi]) is to take as a basis 2 independent solutions Ψ3 and Ψ4 which behave for r  →  0 like r4 and r- 1 correspondingly. Let us first look for Ψ4 and define Φ4: = rΨ4. From ([\ref=Psi]) one gets the hypergeometric equation in the variable w: = 1 / z with the solution

[formula]

We shall prove that the solution Ψ4(r) = r- 1Φ4( - (r / r0)4) is unphysical. For this purpose let us analyze the behaviour of the electric field [formula] "produced" by Ψ4 in the vicinity of the Born-Infeld particle, i.e. for r  →  0. From ([\ref=tph]) we get

[formula]

The first term in ([\ref=singular-E]), [formula] exceeds the unperturbed field [formula] itself.

Moreover, the "perturbation" [formula] leads to infinite variation of the total field energy. The "electrostatic" energy H corresponding to electric induction D is given by (cf. [\cite=BI], [\cite=IBB]):

[formula]

Therefore, its variation reads

[formula]

Now, let us analyze the behaviour of [formula] for r  →  0. It follows from ([\ref=perturb-D]) that this expression contains a highly singular term which behaves like [formula]. Using expansion ([\ref=singular-E]) we see that the first term is purely tangential, i.e. it is orthogonal to [formula]. However, the second term does contain a radial part ~  r3Er and this way [formula] produces a nonintegrable singularity r- 3Er. We conclude that the solution Ψ4 is unphysical.

Finally, to find Ψ3 we define a function Φ3: = r- 4Ψ3 which fulfils once again the hypergeometric equation in the variable w. Its solution is given by

[formula]

To calculate the "deformability coefficient" κ from a formula ([\ref=kappa]) one needs also the derivatives of Ψ1, Ψ2 and Ψ3. However, it is easy to compute them using the following well known formula for a hypergeometric function (cf. [\cite=Watson]):

[formula]

Therefore, taking into account numerical values of corresponding hypergeometric functions one finally gets ([\ref=kappa-num]).

One might describe, this way, the polarizability coefficient of the proton. According to [\cite=Bar], we have κ  =  (12.1  ±  0.9)  ×  10- 4 3. To fit this value one has to take r0  ≈  0.09 . The total mass of the corresponding Born-Infeld unperturbed field acompanying such a particle is about 32 electron masses. We see, that the main part of the proton total mass cannot be of electromagnetic nature and has to be concentrated in the material core of the particle.
