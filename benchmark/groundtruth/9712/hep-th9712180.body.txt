The analysis of BPS states in a brane configuration is important in identifying the low energy effective field theory associated to the brane configuration and investigating its non-perturbative dynamics. An open string connecting these branes can be such BPS states. In the references [\cite=JOH] [\cite=ZWI], they analyzed the structure of the BPS states in the 7-brane background of F-theory and identified the open string states corresponding to the gauge bosons of exceptional gauge groups. The open string BPS configurations with 3-string junctions were essential in the analysis of [\cite=ZWI]. They assumed that these configurations are BPS under certain conditions, and argued that a 3-string junction arises naturally when a string crosses a 7-brane in course of changing the moduli parameters, since this effect is actually U-dual to the Hanany-Witten effect [\cite=HANWIT]. The BPS nature of the 3-string junction was originally conjectured in [\cite=SHW], and have recently been proven in [\cite=DAS] [\cite=SENONE] [\cite=REY] [\cite=KROLEE] [\cite=MAT]. Joining many of these 3-junctions, BPS string network was constructed in [\cite=SHW] [\cite=SENONE] [\cite=KROLEE]. Similar fivebrane junctions and networks are discussed in the literatures [\cite=KOL].

The BPS conditions of a 3-string junction are given as follows. Consider a junction of three (pi,qi) strings (i = 1,2,3) stretching in [formula] directions in x8-x9 plane (|ni| = 1). One condition is that the charges of the strings should be conserved:

[formula]

The other is that the forces from each string tensions should be balanced:

[formula]

where χ and φ are the axion and the dilaton fields of the IIB string theory, respectively.

In [\cite=KROLEE] [\cite=MAT], the BPS conditions ([\ref=chacon]), ([\ref=balcon]) are obtained from M-theory viewpoint. In M-theory, a (p,q) string is a membrane winding q and p times in x7 and x10 directions, respectively [\cite=SHW]. The BPS condition is simply that the embedding of the membrane is a holomorphic map [\cite=KROLEE] [\cite=MAT] [\cite=BECBEC]. Since the number of the winding directions of a membrane describing a string is one, the appropriate complex structure of the target space z1 and z2 must contain each of the coordinates of the compact directions x7 and x10, respectively. Taking the complex structure of the flat target space as z1 = x8 + ix7, z2 = x9 + ix10, a BPS string configuration is just given by an appropriate holomorphic equation f(ez1,ez2) = 0. The authors of [\cite=KROLEE] [\cite=MAT] actually discussed the BPS conditions ([\ref=chacon]), ([\ref=balcon]) from the holomorphic equation describing a BPS 3-junction in a flat background.

In this paper we will extend the analysis in M-theory to the case with 7-brane backgrounds. This extension would be interesting for further understanding of the BPS states and the generation process of a 3-string junction in 7-brane backgrounds. We will first obtain the geometrical backgrounds of M-theory from the 7-brane backgrounds of the IIB theory proposed in [\cite=GRESHA] [\cite=GIBGRE] [\cite=BERROO]. The geometry is hyperkähler. The complex structure obtained naturally in the process will not be appropriate to describe a (p,q) string. Thus we will choose another one. Once we obtain the appropriate one, a holomorphic curve will generally give a BPS string configuration [\cite=KROLEE] [\cite=MAT] [\cite=BECBEC].

The type IIB SUGRA action of the metric, the axion and the dilaton field is given in the Einstein frame by

[formula]

This action has supersymmetric solutions [\cite=GRESHA] [\cite=GIBGRE] under the following ansatz for the metric:

[formula]

The field τ is taken to be a holomorphic function τ(z) to preserve half the supersymmetry and the field Φ in ([\ref=ansmet]) is given by

[formula]

with a holomorphic function F(z). The field τ will become the moduli parameter of the compactification torus in the M-theory description of the type IIB string theory. Hence τ may have a SL(2,Z) holonomy around a singularity. Thus the z-dependence of τ can be given by

[formula]

where P(z) and Q(z) are polynomials in z with no common factors, and the function j(τ) is the j-function, a holomorphic one-to-one map from the moduli space of a torus to the complex plane, defined explicitly by

[formula]

using Jacobi's theta functions and Dedekind's function. In case  deg(P)  ≤   deg(Q) and the polynomial Q(z) is given by

[formula]

the function F(z) is determined by the requirement that it should be regular at zi and that the Einstein metric ([\ref=phival]) should be invariant under the SL(2,Z) symmetry of ([\ref=suglag]):

[formula]

In the IIB string frame, the 7-brane background ([\ref=ansmet]) is given by

[formula]

Now let us compactify the x7 direction: [formula]. After the T-duality transformation [\cite=BHO] in this direction, we obtain the following IIA background:

[formula]

where φA and A(1) are the NS-NS scalar and the R-R 1-form field of the IIA string theory, respectively. Decompactifying an 11th direction x10 (x10  ~  x10 + 2π) [\cite=WIT] [\cite=BHO], the M-theory background geometry is obtained as

[formula]

The area of the compactification torus is (2π)2R- 4 / 3B, where the decompactification limit of the IIB string theory is given by RB  →    ∞  .

Viewing ([\ref=elemet]), the natural choice of complex structure would be z and [formula], and the metric is now

[formula]

One can easily see that this is in fact Kähler with this choice of complex structure by showing dK = 0, where K is the Kähler form associated to it. This 4-dimensional metric is the same Ricci-flat Kähler metric which appeared as the geometry of the cosmic string configuration discussed in [\cite=GRESHA]. A 4-dimensional Ricci-flat Kähler metric is hyperkähler, and this is consistent with that the geometry should preserve half the supersymmetry of 11D SUGRA.

The above complex structure is not appropriate to describe a (p,q) string by a holomorphic curve, because the coordinates of the compactification torus are parameterized by one complex variable v. Since the metric is hyperkähler, we can choose another complex structure. We would like to find a complex structure in the form [formula]. One can easily find a complex structure in this form by using the fact that the Kähler form K' of another complex structure is related to the nowhere vanishing holomorphic 2-form Ω of the original complex structure:

[formula]

with an arbitrary constant θ and a real constant normalization c. After a short calculation, we obtain

[formula]

Here the constant normalization of the real parts of X and Y was fixed by demanding that the metric ([\ref=mettwo]) be expressed with X and Y in a Kähler form. With this complex structure, the Kähler metric ([\ref=mettwo]) is

[formula]

This metric looks just like that on the compactification torus but here the moduli parameter τ depends non-trivially on X and Y.

Once we have obtained the appropriate complex structure, a holomorphic curve will generally give a BPS string configuration including 3-string junctions and string networks [\cite=KROLEE] [\cite=MAT]. Since a (p,q) string is a membrane winding p and q times in x10 and x7 directions, respectively [\cite=SHW], the curve for a (p,q) string is given by [\cite=KROLEE] [\cite=KOL]

[formula]

where s =  exp (RBX) and t =  exp (RBY). This is

[formula]

where

[formula]

The second equation of ([\ref=mgeo]) describing the path in the non-compact space is exactly what is expected from the IIB string picture. In the IIB picture, the mass of a string is obtained by integrating the line elements of the path of the string multiplied by the string tension. In the 7-brane background, the mass of a (p,q) string along a path C is given by [\cite=SENTWO]

[formula]

This shows that a path with a minimal mass is given by a straight line in the new coordinate defined by [formula]. This is exactly what is meant by the second equation of ([\ref=mgeo]).

Another 7-brane solution, which preserves half the supersymmetry and is T-dual to the 8-brane of the IIA string theory, was proposed in the literature [\cite=BERROO]. This circularly symmetric solution is given in the IIB string frame by

[formula]

where r and [formula] are a radial and an angular coordinate [formula], respectively, and the prime symbol ' denotes taking derivative of r. Taking the simplest solution [formula] and choosing the complex structure [formula], the 7-brane background is given by

[formula]

Since this metric can be obtained just by the substitution [formula] in ([\ref=baccom]), the correspondent to ([\ref=hpq]) is obtained as

[formula]

Hence, in this circularly symmetric 7-brane background, the second equation of ([\ref=mgeo]) gives the path of a (p,q) string in the z-plane (upper half plane because Im(τ) > 0) by

[formula]

For the general case of q  ≠  0, the path is hyperbolic in the z-plane, while it is a straight line in case q = 0, showing an interesting charge dependence of the interaction between the 7-brane and a (p,q) string.

Now we will discuss the transformation property of the complex structure ([\ref=eqn:XY]) under the SL(2,Z) transformation in case that τ(z) is given by ([\ref=eqn:jPQ]) and ([\ref=forofq]) with  deg(P)  ≤   deg(Q). The parameter τ(z) given by ([\ref=eqn:jPQ]) has in general a holonomy around a singularity given by

[formula]

Since the moduli parameter τ' represents the same torus as that represented by τ, we may introduce a branch cut and define a transformation property between the two different descriptions on the branch cut. In the case of ([\ref=eqn:jPQ]), the singularities come from the singular points of τ, i.e. τ = i  ∞   (logarithmic singularity), τ = i (Z2 singularity), and [formula](Z3 singularity) in the fundamental region, and any kinds of cuts may in general appear in the z-plane.

As for the imaginary part of the complex structure ([\ref=eqn:XY]), one can easily see that the coordinates of the torus should be related in the following way under the transformation ([\ref=slttp]):

[formula]

As for the real part of ([\ref=eqn:XY]), we begin with the property of Dedekind's function under the T and S transformations of the moduli parameter τ:

[formula]

On a branch cut connected to the τ = i  ∞   singularity at z = zi, the associated SL(2,Z) transformation is the T-transformation, so the phase in ([\ref=phase]) is canceled by the phase from [formula] in ([\ref=eqn:eF]). On the other hand, on a cut connected to a Z2 or a Z3 singularity, a phase factor may remain in ([\ref=eqn:eF]). We have also a one parameter freedom θ in the choice of the complex structure ([\ref=eqn:K']). It turns out that we can introduce the transformation rule of θ as

[formula]

in order that the differential of ([\ref=eqn:XY]) is linearly transformed in the same way as ([\ref=eqn:x_10]):

[formula]

This transformation preserves the metric ([\ref=mettor]).

The transformation of the complex coordinates ([\ref=eqn:dXdY']) will cause a jump of the equation of a BPS membrane curve when the curve crosses a branch cut. The equation of the membrane curve for a (p,q) string ([\ref=eqn:st]) can be expressed as qdX - pdY = 0 in the differential form. Performing the transformation ([\ref=eqn:dXdY']), we obtain the transformation of the (p,q) charge as

[formula]

This transition of (p,q) charges at a branch cut was essential in identifying the open string states corresponding to the gauge bosons of the exceptional gauge groups in the references [\cite=JOH] [\cite=ZWI].

In this short paper, we have discussed the holomorphic embedding of a membrane of M-theory to describe the BPS string configurations of the IIB string theory in the 7-brane backgrounds, and have investigated some of their properties. A general holomorphic embedding of a membrane describing a BPS string configuration would be given by a holomorphic equation

[formula]

using the appropriate complex structure X and Y we have obtained in ([\ref=eqn:XY]). Among other things, the equations for 3-string junctions and string networks would be given simply by substituting appropriately the variables in the equations given in [\cite=KROLEE].

We have discussed infinitely stretched BPS string configurations in the 7-brane backgrounds in this papar. But, for further understanding of the BPS states and the 3-string junction generating process in the 7-brane backgrounds, an M-theory description of finitely stretched BPS string configurations ending on 7-branes would be desired.
