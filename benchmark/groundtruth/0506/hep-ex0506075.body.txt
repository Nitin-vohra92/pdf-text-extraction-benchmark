Abstract We discuss the properties of cosmic ray nuclearites, from the point of view of their search with large nuclear track detector arrays exposed at different altitudes, in particular with the SLIM experiment at the Chacaltaya high altitude lab (5290 m a.s.l.). We present calculations concerning their propagation in the Earth atmosphere and discuss their possible detection with CR39 and Makrofol nuclear track detectors.

Introduction

Strange Quark Matter (SQM) could be the ground state of quantum chromodinamics [\cite=witten]. The initial hypothesis assumed that SQM is made of u, d and s quarks in nearly equal proportions (with some electron component in weak equilibrium). Recently it was shown that the so called "color-flavor locked" (CFL) SQM, characterized by a Cooper-like pairing between different quarks, could be even more stable [\cite=madsen].

SQM is expected to have a density slightly larger than ordinary nuclear matter [\cite=witten] [\cite=madsen]; the relation between the mass M of SQM lumps and their baryonic number A ( ≃ one third of the number of constituent quarks) would be

[formula]

It was hypothesized that "nuggets" of SQM, with masses from those of heavy nuclei to macroscopic values, produced in the Early Universe or in violent astrophysical processes, could be present in the cosmic radiation (the so-called nuclearites) [\cite=ruhula] . SQM should have a relatively small positive electric charge, eventually neutralized by an electron cloud. If the size of the SQM is large (corresponding to masses [formula] GeV), some of the electrons could be in chemical equilibrium inside the quark core [\cite=kasuya]. Nuclearites larger than 1 Å, (M  ≥  8.4  ×  1014GeV) would contain all electrons inside the quark core and thus would be completely neutral [\cite=ruhula]. A qualitative picture of nuclearites may be found in [\cite=noi].

An upper limit for the flux of nuclearites may be obtained assuming that they represent the main contribution to the local Dark Matter (DM) density, ρDM≃10- 24 g cm- 3 [\cite=ruhula],

[formula]

where v and M are the nuclearite average velocity and mass, respectively.

The aim of this note is to discuss the possibility to detect nuclearites using large area Nuclear Track Detectors (NTDs) at mountain altitude (in particular with the SLIM experiment [\cite=slim] [\cite=slimnou] [\cite=slimsimainou]). We classify nuclearites in three different mass ranges (and sizes).

Low mass nuclearites (LMNs), or strangelets, with masses between those of ordinary nuclei [formula] and a multi-TeV mass. The upper bound is an ad-hoc one; an indirect definition of this category could be that many of the properties of LMNs would contradict the assumptions made in [\cite=ruhula] summarized in Section 3. We shall discuss the case of LMNs in Section 2.

Intermediate mass nuclearites (IMNs) or, simply nuclearites, with masses large enough to be well described by the hypothesis made in [\cite=ruhula], but smaller than about 1022 GeV (for M > 1022 GeV nuclearites would traverse the entire Earth). The mass lower limit of IMNs may be about 108 GeV, above which nuclearites could be detected by experiments performed in the upper atmosphere (see also Fig. [\ref=conc]). Assuming that they would travel in space with typical galactic velocities (β  =  v / c≃10- 3), they would be stopped by the Earth, so they would reach detectors only from above. The main properties of IMNs are summarized in Section 3.

"Macroscopic" nuclearites, with masses M  >  1022 GeV; assuming galactic velocities, such nuclearites would traverse the Earth. They differ from IMN's only by size. We shall not discuss this case, since the expected sensitivity of SLIM (and of similar experiments) will not compete with the limit obtained by MACRO in this mass range [\cite=macroini] [\cite=macro] [\cite=macrogg].

Much heavier nuclearites ([formula] GeV) could be observed as abnormal sismic events [\cite=seism] [\cite=seism2] .

Calculations describing the production (through binary strange stars tidal disruption) and the galactic propagation of cosmic ray nuclearites were recently published [\cite=mad]. The results could be valid as orders of magnitude for the entire mass range of interest; we shall use the predicted fluxes (at the Earth level) as reference values.

Searches for nuclearites (mostly IMNs) were performed by different experiments [\cite=naka] [\cite=orito]. The best flux upper limit was set by the MACRO experiment: for nuclearites with β≃10- 3, the 90% C.L. upper limit is at the level of 2  ×  10- 16 cm- 2sr- 1s- 1 in the mass range 1014 GeV < M < 1022 GeV [\cite=macroini] [\cite=macro] [\cite=macrogg].

SLIM is a large area experiment (440 m2) installed at the Chacaltaya high altitude laboratory since 2001; an additional 100 m2 were installed at Koksil, Pakistan, since 2003 . With an average exposure time of about 4 years, SLIM would be sensitive to a flux of downgoing exotic particles (magnetic monopoles, nuclearites and Q-balls) at a level of 10- 15 cm- 2sr- 1s- 1.

Low mass nuclearites (LMNs)

SQM should be stable for all masses larger than about 300 GeV [\cite=ruhula]. Nuclearites with masses up to the TeV region could be ionized and could be accelerated to relativistic velocities by the same astrophysical mechanisms of normal nuclei of the primary cosmic radiation (CR).

LMNs would interact with detectors (in particular NTDs) in ways similar to heavy ions, but with different Z / A. There are different calculations in relative agreement with a possible candidate with M≃370 GeV and a charge Z≃14 [\cite=cand].

In ref. [\cite=kasuya] SQM is described in analogy with the liquid-drop model of normal nuclei; the obtained charge versus mass relation is shown in Fig. [\ref=a-z] by the solid line, labeled "(1)". Other authors found different relations: Z≃0.1A for [formula] and Z≃8A1 / 3 for larger masses [\cite=heis]: this charge to mass relation is shown in Fig. [\ref=a-z] as the dashed line, labeled "(2)". In [\cite=madsen] it was assumed that quarks with different color and flavor quantum numbers form Cooper pairs inside the SQM (the so-called color-flavor locked phase), increasing the stability of the strangelets. In this case, the charge relation would be Z≃0.3A2 / 3, shown as the dash-dotted line in Fig. [\ref=a-z] labeled "(3)".

Several CR experiments reported candidate events that would suggest anomalously low charge to mass (Z/A) ratios, which could correspond to those expected for SQM [\cite=kasuya]. Such candidates are reviewed in [\cite=wilk1] [\cite=raha]. As strangelets with masses not much higher than those of ordinary nuclei could have the same origin as CR heavy nuclei, their abundances in the cosmic radiation could follow the same mass dependence, [formula], [\cite=wilk1]. The existing candidates do not contradict such an hypothesis. The solid line in Fig. [\ref=flux] is the expected flux versus nuclearite mass, assuming that the above assumptions are correct. Obviously, as the mass becomes larger, the production mechanisms for normal cosmic rays cannot anymore apply to nuclearites.

Different nuclearite flux estimates were recently published [\cite=mad]. They are based on the hypothesis that large nuclearites (with masses 10- 5  -  10- 2 solar masses) are produced in binary strange stars systems, before their gravitational collapse. The propagation inside the galaxy considers also the escape, spallation (through which smaller nuclearites are produced) and re-acceleration mechanisms. Nuclearite decays are not considered, as SQM is supposed to be absolutely stable. The predicted strangelet fluxes around the Earth are presented in Fig. [\ref=flux] for"normal" and CFL strangelets as the dashed and the dot-dashed lines, respectively. The small differences (that vanish for larger masses, when nuclearites become completely neutral) originate in the slightly different charge-to-mass ratios (see Fig. [\ref=a-z]).

LMNs would be similar to normal nuclei, except their low Z/A values and, most likely, different abundances. If they interact with the Earth's atmosphere in the same way as CR nuclei, they would not reach experiments at mountain altitude.

Two different (and opposite) theoretical scenarios, both consequences of the hypothesis that SQM is more stable than ordinary nuclear matter, were introduced in order to allow deep penetration of small nuclearites in the atmosphere; none of those mechanisms would allow them anyway to reach sea level; such objects could be found only in high altitude experiments.

Mass and size decrease of nuclearites during propagation

In [\cite=wilk1] it was assumed that small nuclearites could penetrate the atmosphere if their size and mass are reduced through successive interactions with the atomic air nuclei. The proposed scenario is based on the spectator-participant picture. Two interaction models are considered: quark-quark (called "standard"), and collective (called "tube-like"). At each interaction the nuclearite mass is reduced by about the mass of a Nitrogen nucleus (in the "standard" model), or by more (in the "tube-like model"), while the spectator quarks form a lighter nuclearite that continues its flight with essentially the same velocity as the initial one. Once a critical mass is reached (A≃ 300 - 400) neutrons would start to evaporate from strangelets; for A  <  230 the SQM would become unstable and decay into normal matter. In ref. [\cite=wilk2] an estimate was made of the sensitivity of the SLIM experiment [\cite=slim]: the mass number of a nuclearite penetrating the atmosphere down to the Chacaltaya lab would be one seventh of that it had at the top of the atmosphere.

The CR39 used in SLIM is sensitive to particles with a Restricted Energy Loss (REL) larger than 200 MeV g- 1 cm2 . Table 1 presents the minimum detectable mass for strangelets reaching SLIM.

Table 1: The minimum strangelet masses detectable in SLIM assuming different A / Z relations. The masses at the top of the atmosphere are estimated as in Ref. [\cite=wilk1], and the expected fluxes are computed as in Ref. [\cite=mad], and assuming the same mass abundances of ordinary cosmic ray nuclei.

Accretion of neutrons and protons during propagation

A completely different propagation scenario was proposed in [\cite=raha]. The authors assume that small mass nuclearites would pick-up nuclear matter during interactions with air nuclei, rather than loosing mass. After each interaction, the nuclearite mass would increase by about the atomic mass of Nitrogen, with a corresponding slight reduction of velocity. As the mass grows larger, the loss in velocity becomes smaller. They estimate that a strangelet of an initial A≃64 and an electric charge of about +2 could arrive at about 3600 m a.s.l. with A≃340 (3600 m is the altitude of a proposed NTD experiment in Sandakphu, India [\cite=raha]). This mechanism would also imply an increase of the electric charge of the strangelet, thus an increase of the Coulomb barrier; this may be the main difficulty of this scenario. The flux according to [\cite=mad] would be of the order of 10- 9 cm- 2s- 1sr- 1, and higher.

About 171 m2 of the SLIM modules exposed for an average time of 3.5 years were removed, processed and analized. No cadidate survived. The 90% C.L. flux upper limit for downgoing nuclearites (LMNs and IMNs) is at the level of 4  ×  10- 15 cm- 2sr- 1s- 1. This would disfavor the "accretion scenario", and most of the hypotheses quoted in Table 1.

Intermediate mass nuclearites (IMNs)

In [\cite=ruhula] was postulated that elastic collisions with the atoms and molecules of the traversed medium are the only relevant energy loss mechanism of non-relativistic nuclearites with large masses,

[formula]

where ρ is the density of the traversed medium, v is the nuclearite velocity and σ is its cross section:

[formula]

with ρN  =  3.6  ×  1016 g cm- 3. As the chemical potential of the s quarks in SQM is slightly larger than for u and d quarks, SQM is always positively charged [\cite=ruhula], thus the cross section for nuclearites with M  <  8.4  ×  1014 GeV is determined by their electronic cloud.

The following calculations apply to nuclearites of mass M much larger than typical nuclear masses and β≃10- 3; effects due to possible ionization or mass variations during their flight in the atmosphere are negligible. We also neglect the gravitational acceleration of nuclearites by the Earth.

A nuclearite of mass M entering the atmosphere with an initial velocity v0 <  < c, after crossing a depth L will be slowed down to

[formula]

where ρ is the air density at different depths, and σ is the interaction cross section of Eq. [\ref=ruhula2].

We consider the parametrization of the standard atmosphere from [\cite=shibata]:

[formula]

where the constants are a  =  1.2  ×  10- 3g cm- 3 and b≃8.57  ×  105 cm; H is the total height of the atmosphere ( ≃ 50 km). The integral in Eq. 3 may be solved analytically:

[formula]

Fig. [\ref=betam] shows the velocity with which nuclearites of different masses reach heights corresponding to typical balloon experiments (for instance CAKE, 40 km [\cite=cake]), possible experiments using civilian airplanes (11 km), the Chacaltaya lab (SLIM, 5.29 km [\cite=slim]) and at sea level. A computation valid for MACRO [\cite=macro] (at a depth of 3400 mwe) is also included. The velocity thresholds for detection in CR39 (corresponding to REL = 200 MeV g- 1 cm2) and in Makrofol (REL = 2500 MeV g- 1 cm2) are shown as the dashed curves.

The decrease of the velocity thresholds for nuclearite masses larger than 8.4  ×  1014 GeV is due to the change in the nuclearite cross section, according Eq. [\ref=ruhula2].

An experiment at the Chacaltaya altitude lowers the minimum detectable nuclearite mass by a factor of about 2 with respect to an experiment performed at sea level. If the mass abundance of nuclearites decreases strongly with increasing mass this could yield an important increase in sensitivity.

The nuclearite detection conditions in CR39 (expressed as the minimum entry velocity at the top of the atmosphere versus the nuclearite mass) for different experimental locations is shown in Fig. [\ref=acces1]. In this case, the constraint is that nuclearites have the minimum velocity at the detector level in order to produce a track; we remind that for all experiments the REL threshold for detection in CR39 is set to 200 MeV g- 1 cm2 (it was 50 MeV g- 1 cm2 in the case of MACRO).

Fig. [\ref=acces2] shows the same for the Makrofol track etch detector. The detection condition corresponding to CR39 at balloon altitude (CAKE) is also shown.

Conclusions

SLIM is a large area NTD experiment, taking data at the Chacaltaya Cosmic Ray Laboratory. In this note we investigated the possibility to search for nuclearites with SLIM, assuming two nuclearite mass regions.

Low mass nuclearites could reach mountain altitudes assuming some peculiar interaction mechanisms in the atmosphere. They would produce in NTDs tracks similar to those expected from fast monopoles or relativistic heavy nuclei [\cite=slim]. SLIM will reach a sensitivity at the level of about 10- 15 cm- 2s- 1sr- 1 for a flux of nuclearites coming from above. In the absence of a LMN candidate, SLIM would rule out the propagation mechanisms hypothesized. SLIM will be also sensitive to different strangelet structure hypotheses ("normal" or CFL, different Z / A predictions), and could validate or not the production and propagation model proposed in [\cite=mad].

Intermediate mass nuclearites, entering the Earth atmosphere with typical galactic velocities might be detected by large area NTDs as SLIM. The minimum detectable nuclearite mass is very sensitive to the experiment location: an underground experiment like MACRO could search for nuclearites with M  ≥  1014 GeV, the minimum mass accessible to ANTARES [\cite=antares] is of few 1013 GeV. Detectors at ground level, or better at mountain altitudes like SLIM, would decrease the mass threshold to few 1010 GeV; balloon experiments are needed to reach few 108 GeV, while lower mass searches have to be done outside the Earth atmosphere.

SLIM is sensitive to non relativistic ([formula]) IMNs with masses larger than 3  ×  1010 GeV; the large REL of IMNs in NTDs and their property to produce identical tracks in all the detector sheets in a stack could yield experimental signatures with low background.

Nuclearites with masses between few TeV and about 108 GeV are not considered at this time. In the low part of this mass range, they could still be accelerated to relativistic velocities by cosmic fields, and could be detected as LMNs in high altitude experiments. For larger nuclearite masses, one would expect the velocity to get close to the galactic one, and thus such nuclearites would not be able to reach the detector. A search for nuclearites in this mass range could, in principle, be done in space experiments, such as the AMS detector on board of the International Space Station [\cite=ams].

Fig. [\ref=conc] summarizes the conclusion, showing the accessible nuclearite mass regions for different experiments.
