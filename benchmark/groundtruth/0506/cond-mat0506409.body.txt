Orbital order and spin-orbit coupling in BaVS3

and

BaVS3 can be regarded as a d-electron system with hidden order, or perhaps with several hidden orders. Its metal-insulator transition (MIT) has been known for over 25 years [\cite=Massenet], and it was long supposed to be an example of a Mott transition without symmetry breaking. No magnetic ordering accompanies the MIT and it was not discovered until 2002 that there is a structural change: the unit cell is doubled along the trigonal axis [\cite=inami]. The structural order parameter could be used to construct a Landau theory, and this would be sufficient to account for the fact that the MIT remains a second order transition in a wide range of pressure [\cite=kezs]. Nevertheless, we would like to consider BaVS3 as a correlated electron system, and find electronic (as well as structural) order parameters for its phases. A systematic search for order parameters is based on symmetry classification.

The high temperature symmetry group of BaVS3 is [formula] where Tt stands for time reversal. The unit cell contains two V sites along the C3 axis, so the cell doubling mentioned previously means that the T < TMIT unit cell contains four V atoms [\cite=inami] [\cite=pouget].

The symmetry is lowered from Gs by a sequence of three ordering transitions: a hexagonal-to-orthorombic transition at Ts = 250K, the MIT at TMIT = 69K (breaking translational symmetry) and finally, time reversal invariance is broken at TX = 30K. Certainly there is an antiferromagnetic ordering of the magnetic dipoles but it is probably accompanied by the ordering of composite spin-orbital octupoles.

BaVS3 is a 3d1 system. In the high-T hexagonal phase, the t2g level is split into a a1g singlet, and an eg doublet of orbitals |a〉 and |b〉. It is a long-standing problem [\cite=Massenet] [\cite=Mihaly2000] whether only eg states are occupied, or both a1g and eg levels are important. The current understanding emerging from ARPES experiments [\cite=mitrovic] and DMFT calculations [\cite=georges] is that a1g and eg electrons are present in roughly equal proportions. The a1g states form a wide band, while eg electrons carry localized (dipole, quadrupole, and arguably octupole) moments.

The fact that the orbital degrees of freedom of the eg electrons play an important role is shown by the temperature dependence of the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility [\cite=Mihaly2000]. The source of anisotropy is that both t2g and trigonal eg electrons have unquenched orbital moment, and thus there is a first-order effect from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For vanadium compounds, the SOC is substantial (λ  ≈  0.1eV). Susceptibility anisotropy measured by A = (χc  -  χa) / χc begins to deviate from 0 at about 250K, reaches -.07 at 70K, and +0.2 at low T (c is the trigonal axis, a one of the orthorombic axes). The transitions at TMIT and TX are marked by cusp-like anomalies of A. Published results allow a comparison between χc and χa only, but we predict further anisotropy within the a-b plane.

The standard order parameter of the 250K transition is purely structural: it is the change in the c / a ratio [\cite=say]. Lifting the degeneracy of the eg level causes orbital polarization [\cite=sanna] which we measure by the expectation value of the pseudospin [formula], where S is the spin. The transverse components τx, τy of the orbital pseudospin are analogously defined. The time-reversal-odd component is τy = (1 / 2)Lz, the orbital momentum along the trigonal axis.

The evidence from the susceptibility anisotropy gives sufficient reason to assert that the orthorombic splitting must be modest and therefore the orbital degree of freedom τ remains important at all T's.

We performed a symmetry analysis and preliminary mean field calculations for two cases: 1) considering a single V site as a unit, and 2) for the two-V-atom unit cell of the high-T structure of BaVS3. The details will be given elsewhere [\cite=3]; here we restrict ourselves to simple illustrative arguments.

A single t2g electron in external fields can be described by

[formula]

where the first term is the SOC, the second the trigonal field, the third is a quadrupolar mean field corresponding to the ordering of

[formula]

and the last is the Zeeman term. We arbitrarily chose one member of quadrupolar order parameter doublet {Oxz,Oyz}. We find that Oxz induces the mixed spin-orbital quadrupole

[formula]

The magnetic field effects are:

for [formula], in addition to Sz and Lz, also Sx and Lx are induced.

for [formula], in addition to Sx and Lx, also Sz and Lz are induced.

[formula] induces only Sy and Ly.

Analogous results are found for other kinds of orbital order. In principle, we can hope to identify the type of orbital order from finding which non-diagonal elements of the susceptibility tensor have non-zero values.

In contrast to the cubic eg, the trigonal eg doublet carries both dipoles and octupoles. The argument given above is equivalent to stating that the spin-orbital octupole τxSx  -  τzSy has the same symmetry as Sz . This may be relevant for the description of the nature of ferromagnetism of BaVSe3 [\cite=yama].

Going over to the case of the two-atomic unit cell, we have to worry about the spatial distribution of eg and a1g electrons. To a good approximation, there is one localized eg electron per two V atoms, i.e., one eg electron in each high-T unit cell containing the sites V1 and V2. We developed a Kondo-necklace-type [\cite=doniach] spin-pseudospin model in which all ordering degrees of freedom are ascribed to eg electrons [\cite=3]. In addition to the spin (S) and orbital pseudospin (τ) degrees of freedom, we have a second pseudospin η describing the position of the eg electron in the unit cell (ηz = 1 / 2 for V1, ηz =  - 1 / 2 for V2). The 8-dimensional local Hilbert space supports 82 - 1 = 63 local order parameters which we classified under the symmetry [formula].

We carried out mean field calculations in the S-τ-η model, assuming a sequence of ferro-τ and antiferro-η ordering [\cite=3]. Alternating order of the ηz pseudospins amounts to the appearance of a four-V-atom supercell with the a1g-eg-eg-a1g character. Superexchange gives singlet binding at the eg-eg centers of the tetramers, explaining the observed spin gap [\cite=kezs]. Spin correlations are drastically reduced in the para-η phase, though orbital order persists.
