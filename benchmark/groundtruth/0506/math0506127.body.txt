Introduction

The classical Cramér-Lundberg risk model may be written as

[formula]

where Xt is the capital of the insurance company, u is the initial capital, c is the premium rate, Nt is a Poisson process of rate λ, and {Yt}Ntk  =  1 is a sequence of positive i.i.d. random variables, modelling the claim sizes (independently of Nt).

The probability of ruin is written as

[formula]

However, this model assumes no return on investments. For many insurers, the extremely high competitiveness of today's financial market means that they actually have a zero or negative operating profit, thus relying on investing to make up the shortfall and make a profit. The classical ruin model with risky investments has been considered by several authors, [\cite=CAI], [\cite=CON], [\cite=FKP], [\cite=KN], [\cite=N]-[\cite=P3] (and the references contained therein) being but a few.

In this paper, we shall firstly consider loss distributions with infinite support, reproving a result originating in [\cite=P1], and generalised in [\cite=P2] and [\cite=PZ], that if the volatility of the investments is of a certain magnitude, then ruin is inevitable. Our method of proof of this result is somewhat simpler and intuitively easier to understand. This method is also quite flexible, and we are able to prove generalisations of this result for more general risk processes, as well as when the investment is modelled by a certain Lévy process.

Additionally, we provide the transition density when the risk process is regarded as a diffusion, and conclude with some remarks on Lévy processes.

The main idea

Consider the following: Take the classical Cramér-Lundberg risk model, and then act on the capital position by a geometric Brownian motion that models the investment:

[formula]

That is,

[formula]

This is a version of risk process modified for investment considered in [\cite=CAI], [\cite=KN] and [\cite=P3]. The continuous interaction of the combined (standard) risk process and investment can be described in the manner of a semi-direct product:

[formula]

The group with this operation is better known as real hyperbolic space. Some knowledge of hyperbolic space will be needed for Brownian motion, which we will be considering in section 3. It is not a requisite for Theorem 1, although the idea of the action of investments on the risk process will quickly prove this result.

Certain ruin with risky investments

Consider the typical model for a share at time t, St, expressed as geometric Brownian motion with drift and diffusion parameters of a and σ2, respectively. That is,

[formula]

The solution of this S.D.E. is

[formula]

setting [formula]. The classical Cramér-Lundberg ruin model (1.1) is typically modified for investments by putting

[formula]

so that [formula] describes the evolution of the capital of an insurer which is continuously invested in an asset which follows a geometric Brownian motion (independent of Yt and Nt) with parameters a and σ. However, by using the model from (2.1):

[formula]

we view the geometric Brownian motion (share price) as acting as a dilation on the classical risk model. From this fact, our first result follows rather easily, proving the following:

Consider the classical Cramér-Lundberg risk model with investments as in (2.4). Assume further that the distribution of Y1 does not have finite support, that is, P(Y1  >  y)  >  0 for all y  >  0.

If α  <  0 (or equivalently, [formula]), then ruin is certain.

It is enough to prove that the capital position [formula] is bounded, since the claim size can be large enough to ruin the company. Now consider the classical risk model. We have

[formula]

for all t  ≥  0, since the Yt are positive distributions. Thus from our model in (2.4),

[formula]

We are interested in what happens for t large. We have

[formula]

By the strong law of large numbers, Bt  /  t  →  0 as t  →    ∞  , so our dilation term acts as etα  →  0 as t  →    ∞  . From this we deduce that eσBt  +  αtu  →  0 as t  →  0, and [formula] is bounded for all t  >  0. Therefore, the capital position is bounded, and the theorem follows.

Theorem 1 also holds for many generalisations of the Cramér-Lundberg ruin model. The first concerns varying premium rates (c.f. [\cite=PZ])

Suppose the premium rate in the risk model (1.1) is a bounded function, ct. Then with the assumptions of Theorem 1, ruin is certain.

This follows by putting c  =   sup t > 0ct in (2.5) above.

Another concerns when Nt is a counting process other than the Poisson process (see, for example, [\cite=DUF]).

Suppose Nt is an arbitrary counting process in the risk model (1.1). Then with the assumptions of Theorem 1, ruin is certain.

We may also consider variations in the investment model where the Brownian motion is replaced by a more general Lévy process:

Suppose the investments in the risk model (2.4) are modelled by the exponential functional

[formula]

where Lt is Lévy process with mean 0. Then with the assumptions of Theorem 1, ruin is certain.

This follows again by the strong law of large numbers since lim t  →    ∞Lt  /  t  =  0.

Remark: These results also sheds some light on dividend constraints, since paying a dividend may be regarded as subtracting from the value of a above, thus contributing to the overall probability of ruin. Additionally, setting σ  =  0 describes the risk model with a deterministic force of interest, a.

The diffusion limit of the probability of ruin

The diffusion model

The following characterisation of the probability of ruin was first introduced by Grandell in [\cite=GRA], who constructed a sequence of risk processes that converged weakly in the Skorohood topology to a diffusion process.

Put [formula], which has mean λμt and variance λmt. If the premium rate is set equal to λμ then ruin will be certain. To avoid this, a safety loading ρ is added as follows:

[formula]

By regarding the risk process as a diffusion, we may use the classical result of the hitting times of Brownian motion to give the well known "back of the envelope" calculation of the probability of ruin by considering the diffusion limit of the probability of ruin:

[formula]

We now considner the classical Cramér-Lundberg ruin model (considered as a diffusion), and then act on the capital position by a geometric Brownian motion that models the investment. These models follow shifted and dilated Brownian motion on the groups [formula] and [formula], respectively, with their interaction again described by the semi-direct product from (2.1). That is, we will consider [formula] to be a Brownian motion with a drift of λμ and diffusion co-efficient λm. This is somewhat at odds with [\cite=GMY], who argue that no financial asset may be correctly modelled on a continuous martingale. However, some rigour for using the pure diffusion model has been provided in [\cite=PG], who give conditions for a weak convergence to a diffusion (ie, in the Skorohood topology as in [\cite=GRA]), so that we may consider the "unscaled version" of the diffusion limit of the probability of ruin with investments.

Real hyperbolic space

Real hyperbolic space may be defined in several ways. It is usually recognised as the Poincaré upper half-plane (c.f. [\cite=HE2], and [\cite=TER], Ch III). For our purposes, we identify real hyperbolic space as the semi-direct product [formula], where [formula] is the group of reals under addition, and [formula] is the group of positive reals under multiplication. The semi-direct product [formula] is the topological space [formula] with group multiplication given by

[formula]

There are some slight technical details when performing analysis on this group. Firstly, it is a prime example of a non-unimodular group, ie, the left Haar measure is not equal to right Haar measure. More importantly, it is the only simple, simply connected Lie group whose Laplacian cannot be written as a sum of squares of its vector fields (c.f. [\cite=PAU], Thm. 4.1). Since the generator of Brownian motion is the Laplacian, this fact has implications for Brownian motion (c.f. [\cite=PAU], Cor. 4.4). However, this is overcome in [\cite=BOU] and [\cite=COR] by considering a distinguished sub-Laplacian to generate a Brownian motion.

Brownian motion on hyperbolic space

Brownian motion on [formula] was studied explicitly in [\cite=BOU] and [\cite=COR]. The random variable considered in [\cite=BOU] was

[formula]

In [\cite=COR] this was shown to be equivalent under the Dambis, Dubins-Schwarz theorem to the process

[formula]

where (Wt)t  ≥  0 and (Bt)t  ≥  0 are standard Brownian motions, and

[formula]

Its characteristic function is

[formula]

This is then determined, and then inverted to obtain the density:

[formula]

However, we wish to consider Xt as a Brownian motion on [formula] starting from u, with mean ρλμt and variance λmt, being acted upon by a geometric Brownian motion on [formula] with the parameters α and σ. That is, we are considering

[formula]

where (Xt)t  ≥  0 is as in (1.2), (Bt)t  ≥  0 is a standard Brownian motion, and

[formula]

Equivalently from [\cite=BOU] we have

[formula]

which are the random variables - considered separately - in [\cite=KN]. Although as remarked in [\cite=KN] that the density of [formula] cannot be put in a closed form, in the next section we shall derive the combined density of these processes.

The conditional distribution for A(α)σ2t in (3.5) comes from the functional studied in [\cite=YOR]

[formula]

and write At when α  =  0. This functional originates in Yor's work with Bessel functions and its application to pricing Asian options. For a given Bt, if the density of At is given by

[formula]

then

[formula]

where

[formula]

Transition density of the diffusion model

Using the method described above, we are now in a position to obtain the transition density of the classical Cramér-Lundberg ruin model with investments, where both are considered to be diffusions.

The transition density of the risk process (1.1) with investments

[formula]

is given by

[formula]

By the scalar invariance of Bt, and applying the Girsanov theorem, it is readily seen that the density of

[formula]

is given by

[formula]

The characteristic function for the random variable in (3.6) is

[formula]

This is merely a shifted and dilated version of the characteristic function of the Brownian motion in [\cite=COR]. So, mutatis mutandis, we invert the Fourier transform to obtain the density:

[formula]

as required.

Although the expression for pt(z,ex) is far from tractable, we may use it to say the following:

Suppose pt(z,ex) is the transition density for the risk process, then the probability that the company is ruined at time t is given by

[formula]

Evaluating this integral will (more than likely) need to be done using numerical techniques. This expression is particularly important in actuarial practice, since it may only be necessary for the insurer to be solvent at certain times, that is, review dates.

Remark: The above calculations would appear to be valid when the generator is that of the classical risk process. That is, the process on [formula] is a (discontinuous) semimartingale, rather than just a Brownian motion. This allow us to compute the transition density in the case of a compound Poisson process, rather than just the diffusion model, where the combined density would be an expression similar to (3.7). More generally, we could consider the risk process as a Lévy process. These models were discussed in detail in [\cite=MS], which we refer the reader to for many explicit examples. The critical step is a "Dambis, Dubins-Schwarz"-type theorem for discontinuous semimartingales, which is outside the scope of this paper.

Remark: Similarly, the transition density when the investment model is other than geometric Brownian motion requires significant modifications to Yor's work in generalising the density of the functional At when the investment model is a Lévy process rather than geometric Brownian motion. That said, a functional of the form [formula] where Lt is a Lévy process does provide us with a cádlág modification to the risk model in (3.6).
