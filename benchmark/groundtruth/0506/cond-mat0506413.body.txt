Introduction.

The study of ultra-thin magnetic films, with only few atomic layers thick, is recently subject of modern experimental methods such as the molecular beam epithaxy technique. Very little work has been done in the case of the spin-1 Ising model also called the Blume-Emery-Griffiths BEG. This model was originally introduced [\cite=BEG71] in order to explain the phase separation and superfluidity in the 3He-4He mixtures, as well as to describe other multi-component physical systems, such as metamagnets, liquid crystal mixtures, microemulsions, semiconductor allows, ... etc. The critical properties of this model, for positive values of both the bilinear and biquadratic couplings, were established by different approximation techniques [\cite=BEG71] [\cite=MFA1] [\cite=MFA2] [\cite=RG1]. The antiquadrupolar phase, also called staggered quadrupollar phase, was predicted and investigated on the square lattice by means of mean-field approximation (MFA) and by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations [\cite=MC1]. The transition from the antiquadrupolar phase to the ferromagnetic phase was established on a three-dimensional cubic lattice [\cite=HB1] [\cite=HB2] [\cite=BA]. The global MFA analysis [\cite=HB1] on this lattice showed also a number of other remarkable features such as doubly reentrant behaviour and a ferrimagnetic phase which appears between the antiquadrupolar phase and the ferromagnetic phase. Latter investigations [\cite=BA] [\cite=N] [\cite=NB] [\cite=CVM2] [\cite=CVM3] mainly confirmed these results. Using exact solution on the Bethe lattice [\cite=AKH92] have constructed the full set of phase diagrams for spin-1 Ising model for both positive and negative biquadratic coupling. The diagrams showed doubly-reentrant behaviour, staggered quadrupolar and ferrimagnetic phases, but the phase diagrams change when changing the coordination number. Extending the biquadratic coupling constant to negative values [\cite=HOS91], detailed phase diagrams of the bulk BEG model were established, but neither the sublattice non magnetic nor the global non magnetic phases were outlined. On the other hand, the usual phases of the BEG model are found in Ref. [\cite=TUC98], in the case of negative biquadratic coupling, using the cluster variational theory in the pair approximation but only for a bilayer film with five-fold coordination. Our aim in this paper is to study the BEG spin-1 Ising film with negative values of the biquadratic coupling for different film thicknesses N. The phase diagrams we obtained contain some new phases: the sublattice A non magnetic phase NMA, the sublattice B non magnetic phase NMB and the global non magnetic phase NMG, in addition to the usual phases obtained by other authors, namely: the disordered phase DIS , the ferromagnetic phase FER, the antiquadrupolar phase AQU and the ferrimagnetic phase FRI. The paper is organized as follows. In the Sect. 2 we define the model and the used method. Resulting phase diagrams are presented and discussed in Sect. 3. The final Sect. 4. is devoted to conclusions.

Model formulation.

The BEG model, with spins si  =    ±  1, is characterized by two order parameters, magnetization   m   and quadrupolar moment   q:

[formula]

The case we are studying is a bipartite lattice, i.e. the lattice is divided on two sublattices A and B, such that every site belonging to A is surrounded only by sites belonging to B and vice versa. To account the two-sublattice structure we need four order parameters: mA,B  =  〈si〉A,B and qA,B  =  〈s2i〉A,B, where A, B denotes sublattices. The Hamiltonian describing the model is defined by:

[formula]

where si takes the values [formula] at each lattice site, 〈ij〉 denotes a summation over all nearest-neighbour pairs, J and d are, respectively, the correspondingly bilinear and biquadratic interaction couplings. Δi  is the crystal field applied on each site 'i' of the layer k of the film formed with N layers, so that:

[formula]

In all the following of this work we will be limited to the case α = 1. The parameters defining the different phases of the BEG model are:

Phase diagrams.

In order to investigate the existing phases of a BEG Ising monolayer film at T = 0, we study its corresponding ground state phase diagram. This is done in Fig. 1a for a single layer film, N = 1, in the biquadratic coupling-crystal field plane (d,Δ). This shows that the only existing phases at T = 0 are only three phases: the ferrimagnetic phase FER, the sublattice B non magnetic phase NMB and the global non magnetic phase NMG. The NMB phase is present only for negative values of both d and Δ, whereas the NMG phase is found only for positive values of Δ which minimises the corresponding energy term in the above Hamiltonian. The effect of increasing temperature is shown in Fig. 1b representing the phase diagram in (T,Δ) plane for a fixed biquadratic coupling d =  - 1.5. Indeed, the disordered phase DIS is reached at higher temperatures terminating respectively, the phase FER for negative and large values of the crystal field Δ, the AQU phase for Δ  ≈  0 and the NMG phase for Δ  ≥  1. In addition the phase DIS appears also at very low temperatures for positive values of the crystal field Δ  ≈  0.5 while the AQU phase replaces the NMB phase at very low temperature values. The phase evolution of the system in the (d,Δ) plane at a fixed but non temperature T = 1.5, see Fig. 1c, show that the DIS phase is found only for positive values of the crystal field and terminates by the NMG phases for large values of Δ. For negative values of the crystal field, the AQU phase transits to the FER phase and this phase persists when increasing values of d even for positive values of the crystal field. It worth to note that the phases FRI and NMA are not found for a monolayer film. Hence we investigate the phase evolutions in a BEG bilayer film. As it is shown in Fig. 2a, for a biquadratic coupling d =  - 1.5, the first layer k=1 phase diagram, plotted in (T,Δ) plane, exhibits the ferrimagnetic phase FRI absent for a monolayer film. This is found only for low temperatures between the FER and AQU phases. The other phases, DIS and NMG, found for a monolayer film are still present. The DIS phase appears for T  ≥  0.5 and disappears for lower temperatures where the NMG phase takes place for positive values of the crystal field. In addition the AQU phase replaces the NMB phase existing at very low temperatures. The disordered phase DIS appears also at very low temperatures for positive values of the crystal field when Δ  ≈  0.5. Concerning the second layer of this bilayer film, Fig. 2b in (T,Δ) plane, shows that in comparison with the first layer, there is two important points: (i) The FRI phase is still exist and its region is greater than that one found for the first layer and (ii) the DIS phase is found even for T  ≤  0.5 provided that the crystal field is kept positive. The other phases: FER and AQU and NMG are also present for this layer. In order to envisage the film thickness effect on different phase, we consider here a thin film formed with N = 5 layers. We keep the biquadratic coupling at a constant and negative value d =  - 1.5 and study the behaviour of each layer under the temperature and crystal field effect. The first layer phase diagram plotted in (T,Δ) plane, see Fig. 3a, shows that not only the ferrimagnetic phase FRI is reached at higher temperatures T  ≈  1.5 but also that the NMG phase emerges rapidly even for small and positive values of the crystal field Δ. For the second layer k = 2, see Fig. 3b, the NMA phase takes place between the FRI and AQU phases at low temperatures, while the FRI phase is still present and the NMG phase region decreases in comparison with that one of the first layer. Concerning the deeper layers, Fig. 3c for the third layer k = 3, Fig. 3d for fourth layer k = 4 and , Fig. 3e for the fifth layer k = 5 = N, the FRI and the NMA phases persist and some regions of the FRI are detached from each other leaving the place to the NMA phase. These figures shows that not only the NMG phase region decreases more and more when the order of the layer increases, but also the region occupied by this phase decreases when increasing the order layer. Moreover the DIS phase appears even at low temperatures for the last layer k = N. To complete this study, we investigate the thermal dependence of the magnetisations mA, mB and quadrupolar moments qA, qB for a BEG Ising thin film with N = 5 layers for d =  - 1.5 and Δ  =   - 3.0. Indeed, as it is shown in Fig. 4a for the first layer, the three phases FRI, AQU and DIS shown in Fig. 3a for Δ  =   - 3.0, are well illustrated in this figure, for increasing temperatures. The FRI phase found at very low temperature is followed by the FER phase and the DIS is reached at high temperatures. Regarding the second layer k = 2, Fig. 4b shows that the NMA phase appears at low temperature followed by the FRI phase, then the FER and DIS phases are reached, respectively. The NMA phase persists for deeper layers, k = 3,4,5, whereas the FRI region phase decreases and terminates by the DIS phase, see Figs. 4c, 4d and 4e. For all layers of the film, the usual phases: FER, AQU, DIS and FRI are present in addition to the new phases, for specific values of temperature T, biquadratic coupling d and crystal field Δ.

Conclusion

In this work we have studied the phase evolutions in the BEG spin-1 Ising film with biquadratic exchange interactions and single-ion crystal field. We showed that in addition to the four usual phases: disordered DIS, ferromagnetic FER, antiquadrupolar AQU and ferrimagnetic FRI, some new phases are present in the case of a thin magnetic film, namely: the sublattice A non magnetic phase NMA, the sublattice B non magnetic phase NMB and the global non magnetic phase NMG. These phases are studied for a monolayer, bilayer and thin film, for each layer of the film, either in the temperature-crystal field plane or in the biquadratic coupling-crystal field plane. The ground state phase diagram, established for a monolayer film, shows that at T = 0, only three phases are present, namely: NMA, FER and NMG. Moreover, the thermal behaviour of each layer quadrupolar moments qA,qB and magnetisations mA,mB are investigated for fixed values of the biquadratic coupling and crystal field. It is also shown that for fixed values of the biquadratic coupling d, temperature T and the crystal field Δ, the different layers of the film exhibit different phases.
