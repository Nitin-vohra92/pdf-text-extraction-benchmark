Introduction

In this paper we prove the following local regularity result for (complex pseudodifferential) elliptic equations. Let BR denote a ball of radius R and center 0 in [formula], n = 2, 3, [formula].

Let u∈Hs(B1) solve

[formula]

with V∈Ln / 2α(B1), 0 < 2α  <  n, and 0 < 2s < n. Assume also that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

for some ε > 0, ε  =  ε(n,α,s).

By Hs we denote the Sobolev Hilbert space of order [formula]. We write u∈Hs(BR) if u is a distribution on BR such that For any α > 0 the operator Δα is a nonlocal pseudodifferential operator defined on [formula], for any [formula].

Thus the theorem states that, if a distribution u∈Hs(B1) has an extension ũ with [formula] satisfying ([\ref=maineq]) in B1, then we can find a distribution from [formula], ε > 0, coinciding with u in B1 / 2. The particular case of integer s = α arises in the calculus of variations. In this case our theorem says that equation ([\ref=maineq]) improves the regularity of Hα-solutions if 0 < 2α < n.

We will prove the theorem using only two simple facts from Littlewood-Paley theory, namely, the Plansherel isometry and the Bernstein inequality. Regularity for ([\ref=maineq]) for the end-point relations between parameters n, α, and s cannot apparently be established with such simple tools. The only non-obvious assumption on the parameters in Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] is the lower bound for s in ([\ref=restriction_on_s]). Together with the Sobolev embedding it garantees that the product Vu is defined as a distribution.

Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] can be derived from the results of Y.Y.Li [\cite=YYLi], see Theorem 1.3 there. Equation ([\ref=maineq]) is treated in [\cite=YYLi] as an integral equation in the physical space and the frequency space is not used there at all. Technique developed in the present paper does not depend on the structure of the fundamenatal solution of Δα. In particular, it allows to establish the local regularity for more general pseudodifferential equations on smooth manifolds [\cite=Labutin2].

The function V is integrable with the critical power in the theorem meaning the following: if V∈Lp(B1) with p < n / 2α then in general ([\ref=smoothness_improved]) does not hold for any ε > 0 as the family of examples below shows. If V∈Lp(B1) with p > n / 2α then the improved regularity ([\ref=smoothness_improved]) is easy to prove. Indeed, in this case Sobolev and Holder inequalities imply at once that

[formula]

Now ([\ref=smoothness_improved]) is the straightforward consequence of the Calderon-Zygmund estimate and Sobolev inequality.

The main purpose and application of Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] is deriving the full regularity for quasilinear (complex pseudodifferential) elliptic equations with the critical growth nonlinearity. For such application any ε > 0 in ([\ref=smoothness_improved]) works equally well. It is for this reason that we do not care about the sharp value of ε(n,α,s) in Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]. For example, consider a weak solution u∈Hα, 0 < 2α < n, of the equation Assume that g is a smooth, possibly complex valued function of the critical growth: We can write

[formula]

with f as in ([\ref=supercritical_equation]) and V∈Ln / 2α. Now the application of Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] combined with Calderon-Zygmund and Sobolev inequalities improve the integrability of u. Then Schauder estimates imply that u∈C∞(B1 / 2).

This way of proving the regularity for the critical semilinear equations was suggested for α = 1 by Brezis and Kato [\cite=Brezis_Kato], see also Appendix B in [\cite=Struwe_book]. These authors improved integrability of u using Moser's iteration technique. Earlier Trudinger [\cite=Trudinger_Pisa] (also in the case α = 1) had already used Moser's iterations to prove the full regularity for the nonlinear problem directly. The case of an integer α > 1 has attracted recent attention in [\cite=Chang_Gursky_Yang], [\cite=Uhlenbeck_Viaclovsky] due to its applications in conformal geometry. In a related paper [\cite=YYLi] Y. Y. Li proved the full regularity for the equation

[formula]

The main goal in [\cite=YYLi] was to establish Liouville-type theorems for ([\ref=y_y_li]) in [formula] using the moving spheres method. Earlier Liouville theorems were proved for ([\ref=y_y_li]) in [\cite=Lin], [\cite=Chang_Yang], [\cite=Chen_Li_Ou] using the moving plane method. The Littlewood-Paley approach was used in [\cite=Chemin_Xu] and in [\cite=Tao] to give proofs of regularity of Holder-continuous harmonic maps and harmonic maps from surfaces into spheres respectively.

Elliptic equations with supercritical nonlinearity do not improve the regularity of solutions. For example, for α = 1 and any p > (n + 2) / (n - 2), n  ≥  3, the function satisfies However, u is not smooth in B1 / 2. Pohozaev in [\cite=Pohozaev] investigated local regularity for supercritical semilinear problems, and established some sharp low regularity results.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]

Let {j}+    ∞j =  -   ∞ be the standard smooth partition of unity in the Littlewood-Paley theory [\cite=Petree], [\cite=Triebel], [\cite=Stein1], [\cite=Stein2]. Thus j  =  (  ·    /  2j) is supported in, say, the ring Let Pj denote the Littlewood-Paley projection, We also set Distributions with the localised Fourier transform enjoy the important Bernstein inequality: for f∈S' and 1  ≤  p  ≤  q  ≤    ∞   For [formula] the Sobolev space [formula] consists of distributions with the finite norm The Plansherel isometry implies that for s = 1, 2, [formula] the space [formula] consists of distributions with all derivatives up to the order s lying in [formula].

1. First, we localise the problem. Take a cutoff function ηρ, The commutator of the multiplication by ηρ and Δα is a pseudodifferential operator of order 2α - 1. For interger α this is just the Leibnitz formula for the derivative of the product. Hence, for some [formula] we obtain

[formula]

To economize on notations denote uηρ by u and Vη2ρ by V. Then in ([\ref=localised_equation]) we have [formula], supp(u)  ⊂  B2ρ. Moreover, the Ln / 2α-norm of V is small when ρ is small. In the proof we, by making this norm small enough, will establlish that Statement ([\ref=smoothness_improved]) then follows by covering B1 / 2 with small balls. Therefore the goal is to choose a suitable ρ so that for some constant C > 0, C = C(u,V,ρ,n,α,s),

[formula]

Clearly it is enough to prove ([\ref=goal_estimate]) only for large k.

2. The product in the right hand side of ([\ref=localised_equation]) is an integrable function as a result of ([\ref=restriction_on_s]). Hence, applying the Littlewood-Paley projection, we derive that

[formula]

Thus to prove ([\ref=goal_estimate]) we need to estimate Pk(Vu). We take into account the localisation of the Littlewood-Paley projections in the frequency space. It implies that for f,g∈S' the distribution Pk(PifPjg) vanishes identically if Consequently for a fixed [formula]

[formula]

where LL, LH, HL, and HH are the low-low, low-high, high-low, and high-high frequencies interaction zones on the integer lattice:

[formula]

We are going to estimate the four terms in ([\ref=decomposition]) separately. For brevity set As mentioned above, we can make δ as small as we wish by choosing a small enough ρ in ([\ref=localised_equation]). We will always assume that k is big enough, say k  ≥  10.

3. By properties of Pk and the Bernstein inequality

[formula]

Term II is estimated exactly the same way. It is convinient to record the final estimate in the following form

[formula]

4. To estimate III we distinguish two cases. First, assume that

[formula]

and hence n / 2α  ≤  2. Apply the Holder inequality to derive

[formula]

From the Bernstein inequalities we deduce that

[formula]

and similarly

[formula]

Consequently, in the case of ([\ref=n_small]), we can write the final estimate for III as

[formula]

Next assume that

[formula]

Hence By the Holder inequality

[formula]

The Bernstein inequalities imply that and

[formula]

Consequently, in the case of ([\ref=n_big]), the final estimate for III can be written as

[formula]

5. To estimate IV we also need to consider two cases. First assume that ([\ref=n_small]) holds. By the Holder inequality

[formula]

According to ([\ref=n_small]) we have Therefore we can continue with the help of Bernstein inequality and derive that After the summation over i and j lying in the HH zone we discover that

[formula]

provided ([\ref=n_small]) holds.

Next assume that ([\ref=n_big]) holds. Then define q, 1  ≤  q  ≤  2 by writing Bernstein and Holder inequalities imply that

[formula]

Summing this estimate over i and j in the HH region, we conclude that in the case of ([\ref=n_big])

[formula]

6. Now we can prove the desired estimate ([\ref=goal_estimate]). If ([\ref=n_small]) holds, then substitute ([\ref=I+II]), ([\ref=III_n_small]), and ([\ref=IV_n_small]) into ([\ref=decomposition]). If ([\ref=n_big]) holds then use ([\ref=I+II]), ([\ref=III_n_big]), and ([\ref=IV_n_big]). To express the result define According to assumptions of the theorem, θ > 0. Then we derive from ([\ref=first_estimate]) that for k  ≥  10

[formula]

For convenience set We intend to use elemetary iteration Lemma [\ref=iter_lemma] below to bound the sequence {ak}. First take ε  =  θ / 2. Next, find ρ > 0 such that in ([\ref=theta_decay]) we have Then utilising ([\ref=theta_decay]) we can choose J = J(u,ρ) such that with [formula] satisfying ([\ref=epsilon_small]). Now, utilising the definition of Hs-norm find K = K(u,ρ) such that Finally set All assumptions of Lemma [\ref=iter_lemma] now hold and we derive ([\ref=goal_estimate]).

The following lemma is a statement about number sequences. The proof of the lemma is a careful but straightforward iteration of its assumptions. Actually we establish a stronger statement: the proof shows that ([\ref=sequence_decay]) holds even if in ([\ref=convolution]) we replace 2ε by any ε' > ε.

Let ε > 0, let δ satisfy

[formula]

and let the sequence {ak} satisfy

[formula]

with some S  ≥  0. Then

[formula]

with a constant [formula], [formula].

1. From the bounds on ak we derive at once that

[formula]

with a constant A > 0, [formula]. Define Then, replacing aj in ([\ref=inductive_ass]) by 1, we also have

[formula]

2. We claim that for any k  ≥  S and any N  ≥  0 the estimate

[formula]

holds. Indeed, for N = 0 and all k  ≥  S this is just ([\ref=induction_base]). Assume now that ([\ref=N_iter_estimate]) holds for some N and all k  ≥  S. Then substitute ([\ref=N_iter_estimate]) into ([\ref=inductive_ass]) to discover that for any k  ≥  S

[formula]

because for k  ≥  S

[formula]

Hence ([\ref=N_iter_estimate]) is proved.

3. Finally, sending N to infinity in ([\ref=N_iter_estimate]), we deduce according to ([\ref=epsilon_small]) that δCε < 1 and Thus ([\ref=sequence_decay]) holds.
