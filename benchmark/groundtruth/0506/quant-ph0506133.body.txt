The cryptographic power of misaligned reference frames

It has been one of the goals of quantum information theory to find new cryptographic applications of quantum physics. The prime and most successful example of such an application is the protocol of quantum key distribution developed by Bennett & Brassard in 1984 [\cite=BB:84], which implements a cryptographic primitive that is impossible to obtain via classical means.

Another cryptographic primitive of great interest is secure bit commitment. Bit commitment protocols typically involve two phases: a commit phase, in which Alice commits to a bit b (called the message), and the reveal phase, when Bob learns b. The requirements for secure bit commitment are that the protocol is (at least approximately) sound, meaning that when both parties are honest Bob accepts the message b; binding, meaning that after the commit phase, a cheating Alice will never be able to reliably convince Bob of more than a single value of b (although she may force Bob to abort the protocol); and concealing, meaning that a cheating Bob cannot learn the value of b before the reveal stage, irrespective of his cheating strategy (of course, no guarantees are possible if both parties cheat).

Unlike the case of key distribution, neither classical nor quantum resources suffice for secure bit commitment under general circumstances [\cite=mayers:qbcsecurity] [\cite=LC:qbcsecurity] [\cite=LC:qbcsecurity2], not even when both parties participating in the protocol are restricted by local superselection rules [\cite=KMP:ss]. However, it is possible to build secure bit commitment using additional assumptions, such as the hardness of performing certain calculations in polynomial-time [\cite=blum:bc] [\cite=naor:bc] or, in the classical case, the availability of a known, noisy (i.i.d.) channel between the parties (see Ref. [\cite=WNI:bc] and references therein).

This Letter is concerned with the possibility of secure quantum bit commitment when the spatial frames of reference between the parties are misaligned. Depending on a single qubit's physical implementation, its definitions of [formula] and [formula] are given by a local measurement setting which may be directionally dependent. For example, a spin qubit realization will depend on the orientation of locally applied magnetic fields and qubits based on polarization degrees of freedom will depend on the local settings of polarization filters. This means that between different locations there may be a misalignment of such spatial frames. Misaligned reference frames could also arise in a (special) relativistic setting [\cite=PT:rel]. Assume that Alice's inertial frame moves at relative velocity [formula] with respect to Bob and Alice and Bob have partial information about this velocity. This implies that quantum information sent between the parties is subject to unitary transformations representing boosts in the Lorentz group.

Several recent papers have studied the problem of misaligned reference frames. Researchers have considered the task of communicating a reference frame or direction [\cite=PS:dir] [\cite=RG:cc] [\cite=CPS:refframe] [\cite=vanenk:refbit], communication in the presence of misaligned reference frames [\cite=BRS:comm], or the cryptographic use of a private shared reference frame [\cite=BRS:cryp].

In our set-up we assume that Alice and Bob define their computational bases {,} differently. That is, suppose Alice uses {,} and Bob uses {,}. Let U =   +   be the 2  ×  2 unitary matrix relating these bases. If the reference frames are related by a 3-dimensional rotation R taken from probability measure μ, then via the homomorphism between SU(2) and SO(3), U∈SU(2) represents a sample from μ. The distribution μ captures Alice's and Bob's information, which we assume to be the same, about the misalignment between their reference frames. For example, if Alice and Bob have no knowledge about their misalignment, they assume that U is uniformly at random from SU(2). Partial but identical knowledge by both parties can be represented by a more involved distribution μ. The effect of the misalignment is that everything Alice sends to Bob is multiplied by U (in his frame of reference) and everything Bob sends to Alice will be multiplied by U†. This is not unlike a noisy quantum channel. Notice, however, that unlike an ordinary quantum channel, no quantum information is destroyed by channel uses. For example, if Bob sends the state back to Alice, she will recover her original message; or if Bob later learns an approximate description of U, then he can apply a unitary close to U† and obtain a state close to what Alice sent. Moreover, if Alice sends k qubits, the 'channel' applies a random [formula] to the k qubits, unlike k independent copies of a standard channel.

Our main goal in this Letter is to determine whether the no-go results for bit commitment still hold under the assumption of misaligned reference frames. Our results are two-fold. On the one hand, we prove that if μ is uniform over SU(2) or a subgroup of SU(2), then the standard security results of bit commitment still hold. On the other hand, we also show that there exists distributions μ, albeit somewhat artificial, that give rise to asymptotically secure bit commitment.

Let us now prove our first result, namely if the rotation relating Alice to Bob's reference frame is completely unknown, i.e. μ is a uniform distribution over (a subgroup of) SU(2), then bit commitment is impossible.

Let G be a subgroup of SU(2), and μ the uniform distribution over G. If there exists a bit commitment protocol P using misalignment characterized by μ, then there exists a protocol P' using a standard noiseless quantum channel and locally aligned reference frames with identical security parameters.

The theorem shows that there is no gain in bit commitment security over what is possible in the standard scenario when the misalignment is taken uniformly at random in some group, for example rotations around some fixed axis in the Bloch sphere. Thus, as in the standard case, perfectly secure bit commitment is impossible for such misalignments Here is the proof of the theorem:

Given P, we construct P' as follows. Alice and Bob choose random rotations UA and UB uniformly at random from G. The protocol P' follows P, but with the following changes:

Before sending any qubit, Alice applies UA.

After receiving any qubit, Alice applies U†A.

Before sending any qubit, Bob applies UB.

After receiving any qubit, Bob applies U†B.

If both parties are honest, then P' functions the same way as P, except with the reference frames of the two parties related by U†BUA. Since UA and UB are chosen uniformly at random, U†BUA is as well, and the protocol simulates P exactly. Therefore P' is just as sound as P.

Now suppose one party, say Bob, cheats. We can make no assumptions about Bob's actions, but since Alice is still honest, her random selection of UA is enough to randomize her reference frame from Bob's point of view. Furthermore, she otherwise follows P, so Bob cannot distinguish Alice's half of P' from P being executed over a channel with a genuinely random rotation. Therefore P' is just as concealing as P.

If instead Alice cheats, the same argument shows that P' is just as binding as P.

We will now show that the conclusion of Theorem 1 does not hold for general distributions μ. Since noisy classical channels can have a bit commitment capacity [\cite=WNI:bc] (which is achieved by coding), we may expect that a single use of such a channel could lead to a bit commitment that goes beyond what is possible without the noisy channel. In fact we will prove a stronger result, namely that there exists a distribution that allows for an asymptotically secure bit commitment.

The classical protocols developed in [\cite=WNI:bc] are of the following form, which we shall also employ: Alice chooses a set of codewords Ca,b, where b is the message (usually a single bit) to be committed and a is another index of arbitrary size that is picked randomly. She sends Ca,b through the channel to commit to b, and reveals b by sending (a,b). Bob will typically accept if there is a high likelihood that the noisy message that he received in the commit phase originated from the codeword Ca,b for the values of a,b that Alice gives him in the reveal phase. We cannot apply such a protocol directly since our 'misalignment channel' is not i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) which rules out asymptotic coding results. Furthermore, we are considering quantum instead of classical information.

The latter issue is easily fixed. We will consider the limit in which the quantum information that Alice sends behaves classically, that is, Bob can perfectly (in the classical limit) distinguish the states [formula]. In case we deal with 'misalignment channels' for photon polarization, this means that Alice will send Bob a very bright beam of identically polarized photons, so that Bob can determine this polarization vector with high accuracy. If we are working with spins, the codewords that we will use will be spin J particles for J  →    ∞  .

Since any classical protocol has an underlying quantum mechanical implementation, one cannot exclude a priori the possibility for a coherent quantum attack, even though this kind of attack may be technically hard to implement in the classical limit. This kind of attack has been the main limitation to the security of quantum bit commitment [\cite=mayers:qbcsecurity] [\cite=LC:qbcsecurity] [\cite=LC:qbcsecurity2]. In the coherent quantum attack Alice has an additional ancilla entangled with the codeword that she will send to Bob, i.e. she holds a purification of the state she sends to Bob. This may enable her to cheat at the revealing stage. However, for the schemes that we will consider, we can easily argue that such a cheating strategy will not give Alice extra power. We do this by demanding that an honest Bob always first measures the quantum state he obtains from Alice. Since we are in the classical limit, his measurement (of polarization or spin-direction) will hardly disturb the state, but it will remove all entanglement between Alice's ancilla and the state that she sends. This means that, upon Bob's measurement (he acts like a decohering environment) we are now back in the situation where Alice sends the state [formula] with some probability.

Thus we now show that for a certain distribution μ over SO(3) there exists a classical scheme using three-dimensional vectors that gives rise to an asymptotically secure bit commitment.

We start with an example inspired by [\cite=WNI:bc] that demonstrates that some security gain is easily constructed. Ref. [\cite=WNI:bc] introduces a classical channel that inputs i∈{0,1,2,3} and outputs i with probability 1 / 2 and i + 1 mod 4 with probability 1 / 2. Define codewords Ca,b = 2a + b for a,b∈{0,1}. Bob accepts if Alice reveals a codeword that has nonzero (i.e. 1 / 2) probability of giving rise to what he received from the channel. The protocol is perfectly sound and concealing, but not binding; Alice can cheat with probability 1 / 2. This security should be compared to the standard quantum or classical case where being perfectly sound and perfect concealing implies that Alice can cheat with probability 1.

One use of this channel can be simulated by a frame shift that has probability 1 / 2 of being the identity and probability 1 / 2 of being a rotation about the z-axis by π / 2. The codewords are {x̂,ŷ, - x̂, - ŷ}.

A similar, perhaps more natural, possibility is that the frame shift is a rotation about the z-axis by an angle that is uniformly distributed between 0 and π. Using the same codewords, the protocol is still perfectly sound and concealing, but Alice can now interpolate between committing to zero or one by sending the vector cos (απ / 2)x̂  +   sin (απ / 2)ŷ for 0  ≤  α  ≤  1. If she then reveals zero, Bob will accept with probability 1 - α / 2, and if she reveals one, Bob will accept with probability (1 + α) / 2. For Alice, passive cheating is defined as committing honestly to a bit and then attempting to reveal something different; here her success probability is still 1 / 2. However, if Alice chooses α = 1 / 2, then she can convince Bob of either bit with probability 3 / 4.

These examples show that misaligned reference frames can offer small advantages in security over noiseless quantum communication. But can we do better? In the next section, we show that in fact any number of bits can be committed to any desired level of security for some distribution μ.

An Asymptotically Secure Scheme

For our scenario we first assume that Bob can measure the coordinates of a three-dimensional vector that he receives with infinite precision. We then argue that the security still holds in the case of finite precision.

The idea behind the scheme is two-fold. We show that a single use of a channel can give rise to an (asymptotically) perfectly secure commitment when the channel acts on vectors in an arbitrarily high-dimensional space. However, spatial reference frames are only three-dimensional objects which seems to suggest that only a partially secure bit commitment may be achievable. Our scheme overcomes this apparent problem by parametrizing three-dimensional vectors by coordinates of a d-dimensional lattice.

Alice sends a vector [formula] to Bob. In Bob's spatial frame of reference this vector looks like [formula] for some random rotation R taken from the probability distribution μ. The distribution μ of R is the following. Let there be a set of angles [formula] which are not linearly related, meaning that for all integers (positive or negative) [formula], [formula] if and only if [formula]. One of these angles θ is picked uniformly at random. Then R is given by

[formula]

Let us describe our bit commitment protocol with this distribution μ, known to Alice and Bob. Let L be a positive integer.

Commit. To commit to b∈{0,1}, Alice chooses [formula] uniformly at random, but conditioned on [formula]. Let [formula]. Alice sends the vector [formula]. Bob receives this vector as [formula] with rotated angle [formula]. He determines the d-dimensional lattice vector [formula]. If he cannot find such a vector, he aborts the protocol.

Reveal. In the reveal phase, Alice simply sends the classical bits [formula] to Bob. Bob accepts when [formula] and all coordinates of [formula] are 0 except one for which a'i - ai is either 1 or 2. Otherwise he aborts.

Let us now show that this protocol has the desired security properties. Soundness. We assume that both parties are honest. To understand a given realization of this protocol, let j be such that the randomly chosen θ equals θj. In that case the coordinates ai' of [formula] are

[formula]

Due to the linear independence of the θ-angles Bob can perfectly compute [formula] from [formula]. Bob will accept Alice's message in the reveal phase since this vector [formula] is within distance 2 of the original [formula] and the noise acts on only one of the coordinates.

Concealing. A bit commitment protocol is called ε-concealing when for two different messages b = 0 and b = 1 the distributions over random variables as viewed by Bob are ε-close with respect to their variation distance. In our case Bob learns [formula], thus we consider the distance [formula]. For an [formula] with all coordinates at least 2 and at most L we have [formula]. All other [formula]s are 'boundary' cases, which we denote as [formula], for which these two conditional probabilities can be different. We upper bound this boundary term as

[formula]

which can be made arbitrarily small for large enough L for any fixed d. Binding. Consider Alice's cheating strategies. She could have sent a different vector, say [formula]. In case [formula] is not in the x-y plane or if [formula] for some integers [formula] Bob simply aborts. Alice could try to cheat by revealing an [formula] and b*  ≠  b that pass Bob's test. Alice's best option is to choose [formula] that is the same as [formula] except, say, the kth coordinate, which is a*k = ak + 1. This implies that that the parity b* of [formula] is opposite to b. With probability 1 / d the noise acts on the kth coordinate and so [formula] passes Bob's test. The protocol is 1 / d-binding.

In reality we should assume that Bob can only determine [formula] with finite precision, which means that Bob finds some vector [formula] at Euclidean distance ≤  ε from [formula]. If ε is small enough, we can ensure that for all [formula], [formula], so Bob can still determine [formula] from [formula], if Alice behaves honestly.

But what if Alice cheats and sends some arbitrary vector [formula] to Bob? Notice, however, that this strategy could only work if [formula], which happens if and only if [formula]. In particular, [formula] is the only d-dimensional vector such that [formula] is ε-close to [formula]. Thus if Alice later reveals [formula], her cheating still succeeds only with probability ≤  1 / d.

Remark: By increasing d and running the above protocol in parallel several times, it is also possible to commit more than one bit.

It remains an open problem to get a more complete overview of the (im)possibility of bit commitment for general distributions μ. In particular it would be interesting to find realistic noise models for, say, polarized photons, that would allow for secure or approximately secure bit commitment.
