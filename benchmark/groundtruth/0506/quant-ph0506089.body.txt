Introduction

Two orthonormal bases B and B' of the Hilbert space [formula] are called mutually unbiased if and only if

[formula]

for all |φ〉∈B and all |ψ〉∈B'.

The problem of determining bounds on the maximum number [formula] of bases over [formula] that are mutually unbiased is an important open problem[\cite=KW:05] which has received much attention[\cite=Ivanovic:81] [\cite=WF:89] [\cite=bbrv02] [\cite=KR:03] [\cite=GHW:04] [\cite=Wocjan]. We refer the reader to e.g. [\cite=ACW:04] for an overview of known bounds.

The most common application of MUBs is found in quantum cryptography where MUBs are the quantum states used in most QKD protocols[\cite=bruss98] [\cite=BP:00] [\cite=CBKG:02] [\cite=br04i].

By putting the vectors of the bases B and B' as columns of matrices MB and MB', the above condition says that M†BMB' should also be a generalized Hadamard (scaled by [formula]). The problem of determining the maximal number of bases that are mutually unbiased is an open problem. It is known that n + 1 is an upper bound on the number of mutually unbiased bases in dimension n.

For prime power dimensions, several constructions[\cite=WF:89] [\cite=bbrv02] [\cite=KR:03] attain this bound. One construction[\cite=bbrv02], uses so-called "nice" error bases; [\cite=ACW:04] shows the severe "reduce-to-minimum-prime-power" limitation of MUB constructions that use such special bases - for non-prime-power dimensions. For these dimensions, while improved constructions give somewhat better lower bounds such as [\cite=Wocjan], they are not known to be tight. It is generally believed, however, that the upper bound of n + 1 can only be attained for prime power dimensions n.

We show that this belief is reflected in a conjecture on orthogonal decompositions of complex simple Lie algebras into Cartan subalgebras. Establishing this connection is shown to be useful in at least two ways. First, known results on orthogonal Cartan subalgebras of Lie algebras yield three new results about MUBs for small dimensions n  ≤  6. Second, we obtain an alternative viewpoint and new properties for known constructions of MUBs [\cite=bbrv02] in prime power dimensions, obtained by partitioning nice [\cite=ACW:04] unitary error bases.

The notion of orthogonal decompositions of simple complex Lie algebras emerges from the pioneering work of J. G. Thompson [\cite=T1] [\cite=T2], where such a decomposition of the Lie algebra of type E8 played a crucial role in his construction of a sporadic finite simple group, nowadays called Thompson's group. Orthogonal decompositions turn out to be interesting not only by their inner geometric structures, but also by their interconnections with other areas of mathematics: Lie algebras and Lie groups, finite groups, combinatorics and finite geometries, quadratic forms and integral lattices. Following Thompson's work, the original motivation for studying orthogonal decompositions was to obtain a "Lie" realization of certain finite simple groups, as well as to find new interesting (in particular, unimodular) Euclidean lattices. Systematic investigation of orthogonal decompositions has been undertaken by a number of mathematicians; for a comprehensive treatment of the topic the reader is referred to [\cite=KT:94].

Background on MUB Constructions and Nice Error Bases

In this section we recall that the problem of constructing mutually unbiased bases corresponds to partitioning unitary matrices that are orthogonal with respect to the trace inner product into certain commuting classes. The mutually unbiased bases correspond to the common eigenvectors of the commuting classes. Later it will become clear that the unitary matrices of each commuting classes (without the identity matrix) form a basis for the Cartan subalgebras of the orthogonal decomposition of [formula]. The fact that all matrices are unitary implies that all Cartan subalgebras are [formula]-closed.

A unitary error basis E is a basis of the vector space of complex n  ×  n matrices that is orthogonal with respect to the trace inner product. In other words, a set of unitary matrices [formula] is a unitary error basis iff

[formula]

Two constructions of unitary error bases are known. The first are nice error bases, a group-theoretic construction due to Knill [\cite=Knill:96a];

The second type of unitary error bases are shift-and-multiply bases, a combinatorial construction due to Werner [\cite=Werner:00]. There exist nice error bases that are not equivalent to any shift-and-multiply basis, as well as shift-and-multiply bases that are wicked (not nice) [\cite=KR:03b].

Let G be a group of order n2 with identity element e. A set [formula] is a nice error basis if

Ue is the identity matrix,

Tr(Ug) = 0 for all [formula], and

UgUh  =  ω(g,h)Ugh for all g,h∈G,

where ω(g,h) are complex numbers of modulus one.

The group G is a called the index group of the nice error basis N because its elements enumerate the elements of N. It is easily see that a nice error basis is a unitary error basis. Observe that [formula]. Assume that g,h are distinct elements of G, then g- 1h  ≠  e and consequently [formula] by the second property of a nice error basis.

Unitary error bases can be used to produce mutually unbiased bases using the following construction:

Let [formula] with [formula] for k  ≠  l be a set of μ(n - 1) + 1 unitary matrices that are mutually orthogonal with respect to the trace inner product. Furthermore, let each class Ck of the partition of C contain n commuting matrices Uk,t, 0  ≤  t  ≤  n - 1, where [formula]. For fixed k, let Bk contain the common eigenvectors |ψki〉 of the matrices Uk,j. Then the bases Bk form a set of μ mutually unbiased bases, i.e.,

[formula]

The converse direction is also true. If there are μ mutually unbiased bases, then there are μ commuting classes with the above properties.

For a proof of this result, see [\cite=bbrv02].

Observe that the commuting classes in the above construction are maximal. This is because there can be at most n mutually commuting unitary matrices acting on [formula] that are orthogonal with respect to the trace inner product. Let C be a set of mutually commuting matrices. Since the matrices in C are mutually commuting, they can be diagonalized simultaneously. The trace orthogonality of a unitary error basis implies that the diagonals of the elements of C, when written in their common eigenbasis, must be pairwise orthogonal as vectors in [formula] with respect to the standard inner product. Since there can be at most n orthogonal vectors, the above commuting classes are maximal.

It was shown in [\cite=bbrv02] and in [\cite=ACW:04] that unitary error bases consisting of tensor products of generalized Pauli matrices (a particular class of nice error bases) can be partitioned according to Lemma [\ref=lemma:constr_MUB] so that we obtain a collection of n + 1 MUBs for dimensions n that are prime powers. Basically, the same construction was already used in [\cite=KT:94] for orthogonal decompositions of [formula].

Let n = pe be a prime power. Define the generalized Pauli operators acting on [formula]

[formula]

where ω is a pth root of unity. For [formula] define the tensor product U(x,y) of generalized Pauli matrices to be

[formula]

where [formula] is the cyclic group of order p and Zep is the direct product of e copies of Zp. Then it is readily verified that the set N: = {U(x,z):(x,z)∈Zep  ×  Zep} is a unitary error basis for [formula]. Moreover, it is a nice error basis with index group G: = Zep  ×  Zep.

Let n = pe be a prime power dimension. Then the nice error basis in eq. ([\ref=eq:tensorGenPauli]) consisting of tensor products of generalized Pauli matrices can be partitioned according to Lemma [\ref=lemma:constr_MUB] into n + 1 commuting classes showing that there are n + 1 mutually unbiased bases.

For a proof of this result see [\cite=bbrv02] [\cite=ACW:04] [\cite=KT:94]. It was shown in [\cite=ACW:04] that this construction is in a certain sense special. This was already shown in [\cite=KT:94] in the language of ODs. (See latter part of the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:irreducible] of Section [\ref=irreducibility]).

Let N be a nice error basis in dimension n. Then we can obtain at most

[formula]

maximal commuting classes according to Lemma [\ref=lemma:constr_MUB] by partitioning N, where π(n) denotes the primes dividing n and dp denotes the largest power of p dividing n.

Moreover, a nice error basis can be partitioned according to Lemma [\ref=lemma:constr_MUB] into n + 1 commuting classes iff n is a prime power and moreover the nice error basis is equivalent to the unitary error basis in eq. ([\ref=eq:tensorGenPauli]).

The idea behind this proof[\cite=ACW:04] is that the maximal commuting classes correspond to certain collections of abelian subgroups of the index group G of order n. Using some group-theoretic arguments it can be shown that the sizes of such collections are bounded by the smallest prime power contained in n plus one.

Monomial Error Bases and Monomial MUBs

We say that an orthonormal basis of [formula] is monomial if the basis vectors are the common eigenvectors of a maximal commuting class containing only monomial matrices. Recall that an n  ×  n-matrix is called monomial if each row and each column of it has exactly one nonzero entry.

Now we can define what we mean for a collection [formula] of mutually unbiased bases to be monomial.

Let [formula] be a collection of mutually unbiased bases. We say that π is monomial if there is a unitary matrix U such that the maximal commuting classes [formula] from Lemma [\ref=lemma:constr_MUB] corresponding to the U-conjugate collection [formula] contain only monomial matrices.

The standardized Hadamards [formula] generated by a set of MUBs [formula] are character tables of abelian groups iff the MUBs are monomial[\cite=Oscar].

One application of known results on ODs to MUBs that we will see in Section [\ref=monomial] concerns monomial matrices and MUBs.

Notice that the unitary error basis in eq. ([\ref=eq:tensorGenPauli]) consists of monomial matrices and hence the complete MUB construction of Theorem [\ref=th:oscarcomplete] yields monomial MUBs, as will any construction based on nice error bases, by Theorem [\ref=th:pawelnice].

For prime power dimensions n = pe, there is only one other construction that attains the upper bound of n + 1 MUBs, besides the construction in Theorem [\ref=th:oscarcomplete]. This construction is based on exponential sums in finite fields and Galois rings that attains the upper bound of n + 1 MUBs [\cite=KR:03].

There are 3 cases in this construction. A manuscript of [\cite=Aschbacher] shows that at least 2 of these cases are monomial and strongly indicates this for the 3rd case as well. This is done by showing that the corresponding MUBs can be obtained equivalently (after a basis change) by partitioning the nice error bases in eq. ([\ref=eq:tensorGenPauli]). We get the following strong conjecture:

The complete collection of MUBs obtained by [\cite=KR:03] is also monomial and obtained by partitioning nice error bases. This would imply that all known complete collections of MUBs have these two properties.

What about the single known construction of Latin MUBs [\cite=Wocjan] which are non-complete collections of MUBs? Are they monomial (by Definition [\ref=def:monomubs])?

Let us recall some facts about these Latin MUB collections. They exit only when the dimension n is a square and have at most [formula] MUBs. Each MUB in the collection (represented as a n  ×  n generalized Hadamard as in Section [\ref=intro]) is obtained using an embedding operation (a type of tensoring) of 2 ingredient matrices: (a) the [formula] incidence matrix of one of the parallel classes of a net obtained from mutually orthogonal Latin squares of dimension [formula]; and (b) a [formula] generalized Hadamard matrix.

The following theorem shows that monomial Latin MUB collections exist.

If the [formula] generalized Hadamard matrix used in the construction of a Latin MUB collection C is the character table of any finite abelian group of order [formula], then C is a monomial MUB collection.

(Sketch). This proof follows from the details of the Latin MUB construction [\cite=Wocjan] and Lemma [\ref=lem:monoabelian]. If the (i,j)th element of the [formula] generalized Hadamard is hi,j, and if this Hadamard matrix is a character table, then hi,jhi,k  =  hi,j + k. The standardized Hadamard matrices [formula] we get from the Latin MUB collection [formula] will be some permutations applied to [formula]. Clearly the tensoring operation will not destroy the abelian group character table structure. The standard construction uses the DFT Hadamard, which is the character table of addition and gives an example in all dimensions.

The following strong conjecture indicated by [\cite=Oscar] shows that the converse is also true.

The converse of Observation [\ref=ob:monopartial] holds.

The following observation investigates to what extent the limitations of (partial) MUB collections obtained from nice error bases (given by Theorem [\ref=th:pawelnice]) affect (partial) MUB collections, in general. Specifically, we can ask whether any (partial) collection of maximal commuting classes of orthogonal unitaries can be extended into a nice error basis. By Observation [\ref=ob:monopartial] this question is easily answered in the negative for (partial) monomial MUB collections.

The Latin MUBs' give a collection - of maximal commuting classes of monomial matrices - which cannot be extended into a nice error basis. I.e., there is no nice error basis that includes all the matrices in this collection.

By Observation [\ref=ob:monopartial], choosing Hadamard matrices derived from character tables, the Latin MUB construction of [\cite=Wocjan] yields a partial collection π of monomial MUBs. As shown in [\cite=Wocjan], there are infinitely many dimensions where sufficiently many mutually orthogonal latin squares exist whereby the Latin MUB collection is large enough to beat the reduce-to-minimum-prime-power lower bound. Theorem [\ref=th:pawelnice] then implies that π cannot be extended into a nice error basis.

Lie algebras and orthogonal decompositions

In this section we introduce orthogonal decompositions (ODs) of complex simple Lie algebras following [\cite=KT:94].

We refer the reader to [\cite=Graaf:00] for an introduction to Lie algebras, which have numerous applications. Some of the notions will be explained with a simple example.

Let L be a Lie algebra. A Cartan subalgebra of L it is a maximal subalgebra H that is self-normalizing, i.e., if ∈H for all h∈H, then g∈H as well. If L is simple, then all Cartan subalgebras of L are abelian.

As a vector space, every complex simple Lie algebra L can be decomposed into a direct sum of Cartan subalgebras Hi

[formula]

where h is the Coxeter number [\cite=KT:94]. The Killing form

[formula]

is non-degenerate on L; here adA denotes a linear operator on L mapping C∈L to

[formula]

Establishing the Connection between ODs and MUBs

We now have the background necessary to show that MUBs give rise to orthogonal Cartan subalgebras and viceversa when these Cartan subalgebras are closed under the adjoint operation †.

If there are μ pairwise mutually unbiased bases [formula] of [formula] then there are μ Cartan subalgebras [formula] of [formula] that are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the Killing form, where [formula] or [formula]. In particular, a complete collection of MUBs in [formula] gives rise to an orthogonal decomposition of [formula].

Let [formula] be an orthonormal basis of [formula]. Define H to be the linear subspace of [formula] consisting of all traceless matrices that are diagonal in the basis B. Clearly, H is abelian, i.e., all matrices in H commute. Furthermore, H is maximal, i.e., H cannot be enlarged and remain abelian at the same time. Therefore, it only remains to show that H is self-normalizing in order to prove that it is a Cartan subalgebra. Let [formula]. If ∈H for all D∈H, then this implies that A∈H. This can be checked by using the matrices Dij: = |ψi〉〈ψi| - |ψj〉〈ψj| and looking at the form of the resulting commutators

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=th:MUBstoOD] shows that a (complete) collection of mutually unbiased bases always gives rise to (a decomposition into) orthogonal Cartan subalgebras of [formula]. In the following theorem, we show when the converse holds: we characterize orthogonal Cartan subalgebras of [formula] that give rise to to mutually unbiased bases. Let [formula] denote the adjoint operation, i.e., the involutory map [formula], where [formula] means that we take the complex conjugate of each entry of a matrix C and Ct means that we transpose C.

Collections of μ Cartan subalgebras [formula] of [formula] that are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the Killing form and are closed under the adjoint operation, i.e., the involutory map [formula], correspond to collections of μ mutually unbiased bases [formula] and vice versa.

The Cartan subalgebras constructed from the orthonormal bases in Theorem [\ref=th:MUBstoOD] are clearly [formula]-closed.

Let H be a Cartan subalgebra that is [formula]-closed. Then all matrices in H are normal.

From standard linear algebra, it follows that all matrices in H can be simultaneously diagonalized since they are normal and they all commute. Let [formula] be an orthonormal basis consisting of the common eigenvectors of the matrices in H.

Let H' be a second [formula]-closed Cartan subalgebra that is orthogonal to H with respect to the Killing form. Denote by [formula] the corresponding orthonormal basis consisting of the common eigenvectors of all matrices in H'. We show that B and B' are mutually unbiased.

Let S be the matrix with entries sij: = |〈φi|ψj〉|2 for [formula]. Observe that S is a double stochastic matrix. This follows from the fact that B and B' are orthonormal bases. Assume that B and B' are not mutually unbiased. Then S is not equal to [formula] where J denotes the all-one-matrix. Consequently, we may assume without loss of generality (by suitably permuting rows and columns of S) that s11  ≠  s21. Now there must be a column k  ≠  1 such that

[formula]

Otherwise, we would have [formula] contradicting the fact that the rows are probability distributions. Again without loss of generality we may assume that k = 2. But this shows that the Killing form of the matrices

[formula]

is

[formula]

not zero even though A∈H and B∈H'. But this is a contradiction to the assumption that H and H' are orthogonal with respect to the Killing form. This completes the proof.

Next we relate Theorem [\ref=th:dagger] to Lemma [\ref=lemma:constr_MUB], a known result about MUBs.

Any †-closed Cartan subalgebra of [formula] has a basis of unitary matrices that are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the Killing form. Viceversa, any maximal commuting class of orthogonal unitary matrices spans a †-closed Cartan subalgebra. Thus Theorem [\ref=th:dagger] is equivalent to Lemma [\ref=lemma:constr_MUB].

Finally, we state a 20 year old conjecture of [\cite=KT:94] which implies a conjecture that has existed in the MUBs community.

[\cite=KT:94] The Lie algebra [formula] has an OD only if n is a prime power.

This implies, using Theorem [\ref=th:MUBstoOD] that

A complete collection of n + 1 MUBs exists only in prime power dimensions n.

OD constructions are known (cf. the standard OD in [\cite=KT:94], Chap 1.) analogous to the optimal MUB constructions as in Theorem [\ref=th:oscarcomplete] that meet the n + 1 upper bound for prime power dimensions. They have much the same properties such as niceness and monomiality (as in Observation [\ref=ob:nicemonocomplete]). This will be discussed further in Section [\ref=irreducibility], where we will see that in fact the two constructions are essentially equivalent and satisfy further strong requirements.

A new upper bound for a common type of MUB

Both conjectures of the previous section remain open even in the smallest dimension n  =  6. However, the following is shown in [\cite=KT:94] (Chap. 1). A Cartan subalgebra H is called monomial if it has a basis consisting of only monomial matrices.

The Lie algebra [formula] cannot have more than 3 pairwise orthogonal monomial Cartan subalgebras.

This gives the first nontrivial MUB upper bound below for non-prime-power dimensions for monomial MUBs. These are a common and natural type of MUB, since Observation [\ref=ob:nicemonocomplete], and [\ref=ob:monopartial] indicate that known constructions of MUBs - both complete and partial collections - correspond to monomial MUBs.

There are no more than 3 monomial MUBs in dimension n = 6.

The proof follows directly from Theorem [\ref=th:monomialcartan], using the definitions of monomial MUBs and Cartan subalgebras and Theorem [\ref=th:daggeroscar].

Irreducible ODs and new properties of known MUB constructions

Let Aut(L) be the group of automorphisms of the Lie algebra [formula]. This group acts on L by conjugation. We say that two elements (resp. subsets, collections of subsets) of L are equivalent if one is an Aut(L)-conjugate of the other. Likewise, we say that an element (resp. subset, collection of subsets) satisfying a property P is unique if all elements (resp. subsets, collections of subsets) satisfying P are in the same Aut(L)-conjugacy class.

If n is a prime power, then [formula] admits the so-called standard OD (cf. [\cite=KT:94], Chap. 1). This OD consists of monomial, [formula]-closed Cartan subalgebras. By Theorem [\ref=th:daggeroscar], it corresponds to a partition of a nice error basis and is equivalent to the OD obtained the construction of Theorem [\ref=th:oscarcomplete].

The description of the standard OD gives another view of the construction of Theorem [\ref=th:oscarcomplete] as arising from the projective representation of degree pm of the elementary abelian group of order p2m, using the desarguesian plane of order pm.

Let [formula] be an OD of L. Further, let Aut(D) be the subgroup of all automorphisms φ of L that preserve D (that is, for any i there is i' such that φ(Hi)  =  Hi'). Clearly, Aut(D) also acts on the space L by conjugation. We say that an OD D is irreducible if Aut(D) acts irreducibly on L. I.e., the orbit of any element of [formula] under this action spans all of [formula].

One of the main results of [\cite=KT:94] is that the standard OD of Theorem [\ref=th:standard] is essentially the unique irreducible OD.

If Lie algebra [formula] admits an irreducible OD D, then n  =  pm for some prime p, and D is equivalent the aforementioned standard OD, except for n  =  27.

In the case of n  =  27, an additional irreducible OD D can be constructed using the projective representation of degree 27 of the elementary abelian group of order 36, together with the so-called Hering plane of order 27.

(Sketch). The proof in [\cite=KT:94] (Chapters 4 and 5) is quite involved and uses the classification of finite simple groups. The first part shows that in order for the OD D to be irreducible, the group Aut(D) must have a nontrivial subgroup S that fixes each Cartan subalgebra in D: i.e., the kernel of the homomorphism φ ~ : ~ Aut(D)  →  Sn + 1 is non-empty; Sn + 1 is the symmetric group of permutations, in this case, of the n + 1 Cartan subalgebras in the OD. The latter part uses the fact that this subgroup S is a p-group and shows that the OD must be the standard OD of Theorem [\ref=th:standard]. This part of the proof is effectively the proof in [\cite=ACW:04] that a complete partition of a nice error bases only exists for prime power dimensions and is equivalent to the construction in Theorem [\ref=th:oscarcomplete].

Next we define the irreducibility condition directly for complete MUB collections, which intuitively indicates that the MUB collection has a large group of symmetries. We then prove a corresponding result to Theorem [\ref=th:irreducible] directly for MUBs, showing that the standard MUB collection of Theorem [\ref=th:oscarcomplete] is in fact irreducible,

Let [formula] be a complete collection of pairwise mutually unbiased bases of [formula]. Consider the subgroup Aut(π) consisting of all unitary matrices [formula] that preserve π, that is, for any i there is i' such that the sets XBiX- 1 and Bi' are equal. Assume that Aut(π) acts (via conjugation) on [formula] irreducibly. We call such a π an irreducible MUB collection. Then n  =  pm is a prime power. Moreover, if n  ≠  27 then such a π is unique up to [formula]-conjugacy and the order of the members of π: it is [formula]-conjugate to the MUB collection of Theorem [\ref=th:oscarcomplete].

Consider the OD D corresponding to π by Theorem [\ref=th:MUBstoOD]. It is straightforward to check that Aut(π) acts on D. This action induces a homomorphism φ ~ : ~ Aut(π)  →  Aut(D) with kernel equal [formula]. It follows by the assumption that Aut(D) acts irreducibly on L. By Theorem [\ref=th:irreducible], n  =  pm is a prime power, and if n  ≠  27, then D is unique and equivalent to the standard OD of Theorem [\ref=th:standard]. Observe that π can be reconstructed uniquely from D: each Cartan subalgebra Hi that lies in D can be diagonalized to yield a unique basis Bi of [formula], and π is just the collection of all Bi's, which, by Theorem [\ref=th:standard], is [formula]-conjugate to the MUB collection of Theorem [\ref=th:oscarcomplete].

Finally, we use a known result of [\cite=KT:94] for small dimensions n  ≤  5 to show that complete collections of MUBs for these dimensions are essentially unique, monomial, irreducible and obtained by partitioning a nice error basis. In fact, they are equivalent to the standard complete MUB collection of Theorem [\ref=th:oscarcomplete] for prime power dimensions.

The Lie Algebra [formula] for n  ≤  5 has a unique, irreducible OD equivalent to the standard OD.

We can state this result directly for MUBs as follows.

Let [formula] be a complete set of pairwise mutually unbiased bases of [formula] for n  ≤  5. Then such a π is unique up to [formula]-conjugacy and the order of the members of π. which, by Theorem [\ref=th:standard], is [formula]-conjugate to the MUB collection of Theorem [\ref=th:oscarcomplete].

Use the connection between ODs and MUBs as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:irreduciblemubs], and apply Theorem [\ref=th:smallOD].

Potential Extensions and Related Questions

We have shown that if an OD is irreducible, then it exists only in prime power dimensions and is essentially unique: monomial, [formula]-closed hence gives rise to a complete collection of MUBs equivalent to the the known construction of MUBs, obtained by partitioning nice error bases. For small prime powers n  ≤  5, ODs and the corresponding complete MUB collections are unique. For n = 6 at most 3 monomial MUBs or Cartan subalgebras exist.

To leverage the above results, here are some natural questions to ask.

Although tempting, it is not promising to conjecture that if there is any †-closed OD, then there is one that is irreducible. Intuitively, irreducibility means that the OD has a large group of symmetries and there are many instances where such statements are known to be false, i.e., the optimal or extremal constructions often do not exhibit significant symmetry.

Question 1. Can one generalize the irreducibility condition or its consequences either by (a) weakening the condition - instead of requiring that the action of Aut(D) on [formula] be irreducible, require that it generates a large irreducible component of [formula]; or by (b) extending the irreducibility definition to (the group of automorphisms that preserve) incomplete or partial collections of Cartan subalgebras.

On first inspection, both do not appear to be promising approaches.

Question 2. Can one show that if there is any collection of Cartan subalgebras or MUBs or maximal commuting classes of orthogonal unitary matrices, then there is always a monomial collection of the same size?

More general related questions are the following.

Question 3. How do these properties (irreducibility, niceness, monomiality) relate in general?

Some care is required in posing this type of question since these properties apply to different entities. Irreducibility is a property so far defined and studied only for complete ODs, (although as mentioned above, the definition could potentially be extended to partial collections of Cartan subalgebras). Niceness is a property of a complete, unitary error basis without the requirement of the existence of an OD. Monomiality is a property that is well-defined for any (partial) collection of maximal commuting classes, Cartan subalgebras or MUBs.

Results in [\cite=KT:94] show that monomiality of an OD does not imply irreducibility of the OD.

Furthermore, when refering just to unitary error bases (without imposing the requirement that they be partitionable into a complete collection), these monomiality and niceness do not imply each other as shown by [\cite=KR:03b]: not all nice error bases are monomial nor viceversa.

In this context, natural questions related to the results of [\cite=KR:03b] is the following.

Question 4. If we restrict ourselves to unitary error bases that give a complete collection of maximal commuting classes and MUBs, then we know that niceness of the unitary error basis imply monomiality by Theorem [\ref=th:pawelnice] (or Theorem [\ref=th:irreducible]). But under this condition, does monomiality imply niceness? A positive answer to this question would imply that monomial complete collections of MUBs exist only in prime power dimensions.

Question 5. Since monomiality is well-defined for any (partial) collection of maximal commuting classes, we can ask if such a collection can always be extended into an entire error basis that is monomial. Note that if the answer to Question 4 is yes, then the answer to Question 5 must be no, and viceversa, because of Observation [\ref=ob:mononice].
