Introduction and related results

All graphs in this paper are finite, simple and undirected graphs. By clique number of a graph G we mean the largest order of a complete subgraph in G and denote it by ω(G). Also α(G) stands for the largest number of independent vertices in G. For other notations which are not defined here we refer the reader to [\cite=Bondy].

An antimatching of a graph G is a matching of its complement.

A proper coloring of G is a coloring of the vertices such that any two adjacent vertices have different colors. Given a proper coloring of G, a t-dominating set T  =  {x1,...,xt} is a set of vertices such that T is colored by t colors and each xi is adjacent to t - 1 vertices of different colors. In that case, and if G is colored by exactly t colors, we say we have a t-dominating coloring (or b-coloring with t colors). We denote by φ(G) the maximum number t for which there exists a t-dominating set in a coloring of V(G) by t colors. This parameter has been defined by Irving and Manlove [\cite=IM], and is called the b-chromatic number of G. In a b-coloring of a graph G with b colors, any vertex v which has at least b - 1 neighbors with different colors is called a representative. We note that in any b-coloring of G with b colors there should be at least b representatives with b different colors.

It is known that χ(G)  ≤  φ(G)  ≤  Δ ~  + 1. Let G be a graph with decreasing degree sequence [formula] and let m(G) = max ~ {i:d(xi)  ≥  (i - 1)}. In [\cite=IM], the authors proved that for any graph G, φ(G)  ≤  m(G) and they show that for tree T the inequality m(T) - 1  ≤  φ(G)  ≤  m(T) is satisfied.

Also in [\cite=IM] it is shown that determining φ is NP-hard for general graphs, but polynomial for trees.

Some authors have obtained upper or lower bounds for φ(G) when G belongs to some special families of graphs. In [\cite=K], b-chromatic number of graphs with girths five and six has been studied. Let G be a graph of girth at least 5, of minimum degree δ and of diameter D, it is shown in [\cite=K] that φ(G) >  min {δ,D / 6} and that if G is d-regular, of girth at least six, then φ(G)  =  d + 1. In this last case the construction of a b-dominating coloring is done in a polynomial time.

Kratochvil et al. in [\cite=KTV] showed that for a d-regular graph G with at least d4 vertices, φ(G) = d + 1.

In [\cite=KM], Kouider and Mahéo discuss on the b-chromatic number of the cartesian product [formula] of two graphs G and H. They prove that [formula] when G (resp. H) admits φ(G) (resp. φ(H)) dominating set which is stable set.

We also recall the following result of Klein and Kouider [\cite=KK]. Let D be [formula]. Let G be a P4-free graph, then φ(G) = ω(G), for any induced subgraph of G if and only if G is 2D-free and 3P3-free.

The aim of this paper is to obtain an upper bound for b-chromatic number of a graph G when G is restricted to be in special families of graphs. In section 2 we consider K1,t -free graphs. In section 3 we give an upper bound in terms of clique number and minimum clique partition of a graph. Finally in section 4 bipartite graphs will be considered. We also show that all the bounds obtained in this paper are tight.

K1,t -free graphs

In this section we give an upper bound for the b-chromatic number of K1,t -free graphs, when t  ≥  3. If t = 2 then the graph should be a complete graph for which the b-chromatic number is the same as chromatic number.

Let G be a K1,t -free graph where t  ≥  3, then φ(G)  ≤  (t - 1)(χ(G) - 1) + 1.

Suppose φ(G) = b. Let C be a color class in a b-coloring of G with b colors, and let x be any representative of the class C. Among the neighbors of the vertex x there exist a set say S of b - 1 vertices with distinct colors. Let H be the subgraph induced by S. By the hypothesis on the graph G we have α(H)  ≤  t - 1 and also χ(H)  ≤  χ(G)  -  1. So

[formula]

Therefore b  ≤  (t - 1)(χ(G) - 1) + 1.

In the following we show that the bound of the theorem can be achieved for each t.

For any integer t  ≥  3 and k, there exists a K1,t -free graph G such that χ(G) = k and φ(G)  =  (t - 1)(k - 1) + 1.

Suppose the graph H is defined as a vertex v such that its neighbors form t - 1 mutually disjoint cliques with k - 1 vertices. Now we take (t - 1)(k - 1) + 1 disjoint copies of H and connect them sequentially by exactly one edge between any two consecutive copies. These edges can be incident to any vertex other than v and its copies in other copies of H. We denote the resulting graph by G. It is easily seen that G satisfies the conditions of theorem.

We have now the following immediate corollary of theorem [\ref=free].

If G is a claw-free graph, then φ(G)  ≤  2χ(G) - 1.

In [\cite=CS] the important fact χ(G)  ≤  2ω(G) is proved for a claw-free graph G satisfying α(G)  ≥  3, therefore using this result we obtain φ(G)  ≤  4ω(G)  -  1.

b-coloring and minimum clique partition

In this section we give a bound for the b-chromatic number of a graph G in terms of its minimum clique partition. A clique partition for a graph G is any partition of V(G) into subsets say [formula] in such a way that the subgraph of G induced by Ci is a clique, for each i. We denote by θ(G) the minimum number of subsets in a clique partition of the graph G. We note that for any graph G, [formula]; also, if θ(G) = k then G is the complement of a k-partite graph. Therefore the following result applies for all graphs.

Let G be a graph with clique partition number θ(G) = k and clique number ω, then [formula].

If k = 1 then G is complete and equality holds in the inequality of theorem. We suppose now k  ≥  2. As θ(G) = k, therefore α(G)  ≤  k. Let us consider a b-coloring of G with φ(G) = b colors. Let ij be the number of color classes with exactly j elements. As α(G)  ≤  k, we know that ij = 0 for j  ≥  k + 1. So we have

[formula]

By hypothesis, there exists a partition of V(G) into k complete subgraphs, therefore if n is the order of G,

[formula]

Suppose first that i1 = 0. Then any color class in the b-coloring of G with b colors contains at least two vertices. This shows that b  ≤  n / 2 and so b  ≤  kω / 2. Finally [formula], because [formula].

Suppose now i1  ≥  1 and let Ci  =  {xi} for [formula]. Then any representative of any color j is adjacent to any xi, where i,j  ≤  i1 and i  ≠  j.

It follows that [formula] induces a complete subgraph of G. On the other hand, by the fact that there exists a partition of V(G) into k cliques and the pigeonhole principle, at least [formula] of representative vertices form a complete graph. We know from above that any representative of any color j is adjacent to any xi,i  ≠  j,i  ≤  i1, consequently there is a complete subgraph of at least [formula] vertices. We get the following inequality

[formula]

in other words,

[formula]

Now we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

So we have

[formula]

and by inequality (1),

[formula]

By inequality (2),

[formula]

The theorem is proved.

In order to construct our graph we first consider three sets of mutually disjoint cliques [formula], [formula] and [formula] where [formula], [formula], for each [formula]. We put an edge between any two vertices u and v in Ai and Aj for each i and j, therefore [formula] forms a clique with [formula] vertices. Then we join any vertex in Ai to any vertex in Bj for each i and j, and also we join the vertices of Ai to all the vertices of Ci, for each i. We don't have any edge between any two vertices of Bi and Bj when i  ≠  j and the same holds for Ci's. Finally we put an edge between any two vertices v∈Bi and u∈Cj if i  ≠  j.

We color the vertices in [formula] with [formula] and the vertices of [formula] with distinct colors [formula]. The colors in Ci will be the same as Bi for each i. All the vertices of [formula] are representatives and the same holds for [formula].

Now it is enough to show that the constructed graph G has the clique number ω. We first observe that if we identify each of cliques Ai's, Bi's and Ci's with single vertices ai's, bi's and ci's, respectively, then we may define a graph H with 3k vertices with vertex set [formula] where there is an edge between two vertices u and v if and only if their corresponding cliques are jointed in the graph G. Therefore to find the maximum number of vertices in a clique of the graph G, it is enough to check all cliques in H. Let us first set [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Let K be a clique in H. There are two possibilities:

1. There is no vertex from C in K. In this case K may contain all vertices in A and at most one from B, i.e. with at most k + 1 vertices. This clique results in a clique in G with [formula] vertices.

2. There is one vertex from C in K. In this case K contains only one vertex from C and at most one vertex from A and one from B. And this may happen when we consider for example a1 and its neighbor in C and a suitable vertex in B. This clique of order three results in a clique in G with [formula] vertices.

The following result is an immediate corollary of theorem [\ref=clique-partition].

For any graph G, with clique-number ω(G),

[formula]

In the case that G is the complement of a bipartite graph we have more knowledge on its b-colorings. We first introduce some special graphs which play an important role in b-colorings of the complement of bipartite graphs. Before we begin let us mention that when we say there is an anti-matching between two subsets X and Y in a graph G, it means that there exists a matching between X and Y in the complement of G.

Let G be the complement of a bipartite graph with a bipartition (X,Y) in such a way that there are partitions of X and Y into three subsets as [formula] and [formula] such that the following properties hold:

1. Any vertex in A1 is adjacent to any vertex in [formula], hence the subgraph induced by [formula] in G is a clique. Also any vertex in A2 is adjacent to any vertex in C1.

2. |B1| = |B2| and there is a perfect anti-matching between B1 and B2.

3. |C1| = |C2| and there is a perfect anti-matching between C1 and C2.

In this case by letting [formula], we say G belongs to the family Ab. In fact Ab consists of all the complement of bipartite graphs G which admits the above-mentioned properties. Let us remark that φ(G)  ≥  b for any graph G belonging to Ab. In fact, we color [formula] with different colors; using the antimatchings, we give to B2 the same colors as B1, and to C2 the same colors as C1.

Let G be the complement of a bipartite graph, then [formula]. Furthermore, there is a b-coloring for G with b colors if and only if G is in Ab.

The inequality [formula] follows from theorem [\ref=clique-partition] where we put k = 2.

If G is in Ab then by the comment before theorem [\ref=cobip] there is a b-coloring for G with b colors.

Suppose now we have a b-coloring for G = (X,Y;E) with b colors [formula]. Let the color classes be U1, U2, , Ub and without loss of generality we may suppose that |Ui| = 1 for [formula]. Therefore |Ui|  =  2 for i > t. Set [formula] and [formula].

Let ui,i = t + 1,...,s be the representatives contained in X and they form a set B1; let ui,i = s + 1,...,b be the remaining representatives, these are by definition in [formula] and they form a set C2. As each color class for i  ≥  t + 1, has exactly 2 elements, there exists a set B2 in Y with |B2|  =  |B1| with the same colors as B1. Similarly there exists a set C1 in Y with |C2|  =  |C1| with the same colors as C2.

There are perfect anti-matchings, one between B1 and B2 and another between C1 and C2. By the property of being representative for each element of [formula], and by the unicity of the elements colored by the colors of [formula], [formula] is a clique, [formula] is also a clique. Considering now the partitions [formula] and [formula] we conclude that G belongs to Ab.

We get easily the following consequence.

Let G be the complement of a bipartite graph. Then

[formula]

if and only if  max {k:G∈Ak} ~  = b.

Let us remark that for the larger class of graphs G with α(G) = 2, there is no linear bound for b-chromatic number (even for chromatic number) in terms of ω(G) because, as pointed out in [\cite=CS], or each k there is a graph G with α(G) = 2 such that χ(G)  ≥  k / 2 and ω(G) = o(k).

Bipartite graphs

In this chapter we suppose G is a bipartite graph. In the following by the biclique number of G we mean the minimum number of mutually disjoint complete bipartite graphs which cover the vertices of G. Any subgraph of G which is complete bipartite graph is called a biclique of G.

Let G be a bipartite graph with bipartition (X,Y), on n vertices and biclique number t. Then

[formula]

We first prove the theorem for graphs G = (X,Y) which admits a b-coloring with b = φ(G) colors where there is at least one representative in X and also one in Y. Let these representatives be v∈X and u∈Y. Then v has at least b - 1 neighbors in Y and also u has at least b - 1 neighbors in X. These give us two bicliques with cardinality at least 2b - 2 and at most 2b. As t is the biclique number of G there should be at least t - 2 vertices in G. Therefore n  ≥  2b - 2 + t - 2 and so [formula].

Now we may suppose that in a b-coloring of G, all the representatives are in a same part say X. Let ij be the number of color classes in the b-coloring with exactly j colors in part Y. There are two possibilities.

Suppose first that i1  ≥  1. Let w be the vertex in any color class with cardinality one in the part Y. Then w belongs to Y and has b - 1 neighbors which are representatives of different colors. So w is representative. This is a contradiction with the hypothesis on X.

Now let p be the minimum number with ip  ≠  0. So p  ≥  2. We have n  ≥  b + bp  =  b(p + 1). We may suppose at this stage that all vertices in X are representatives and of different colors, and, also any vertex y in Y is adjacent to, at least, some representative and is the unique vertex of color c(y) of this representative. Otherwise, if we delete those vertices in X which are not representatives and also vertices in Y without the previous property, we prove the inequality of the theorem, for the resulting graph G'. Let n - l be its order. We have

[formula]

As the inequality t  ≤  t' + l holds, it can be seen easily that we get

[formula]

We also have, by construction of G', φ(G)  ≤  φ(G').

So it is enough to prove the theorem for the case where all the vertices in X are representative and any vertex in Y is adjacent to some representative. By these hypothesis, and as the coloring is proper, we have t  ≤  b. Finally since n  ≥  b(p + 1) and p  ≥  2 then 2b  ≤  n  -  (p - 1)b  ≤  n - b  ≤  n - t. Therefore [formula].

For any integer p  ≥  3, there is a bipartite graph G with n = 3p - 4 vertices and biclique number t = p - 1 such that [formula].

We first consider a complete bipartite graph Kp - 1,p - 1 minus a matching with size p - 2. We color one part say X of this graph with [formula] and other part say Y with [formula] so that vertices with colors 1 and 2 are adjacent. Then we add p - 2 extra vertices to the part X and color all of them with 2. Now put a matching with size p - 2 between these extra vertices in X and all the vertices in Y except the one colored by 2. The resulting graph G is a graph of order n = 3p - 4 with a b-coloring with p colors. In fact, b(G) is exactly equal to p because Δ(G) = p - 1. By the precedent theorem,

[formula]

It is then enough to show that t  ≥  p - 1 to get the reverse inequality. Because there are p - 2 vertices with degree one, at least p - 2 cliques are required to cover these vertices. We observe that we need an extra clique to cover the vertex colored by 2 in Y. Now we get the equality [formula].
