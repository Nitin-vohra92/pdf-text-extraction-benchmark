Introduction

It is widely believed that conformal field theory is dynamically realized in a large class of non-abelian gauge theories with a certain number of matter multiplets (see Ref.[\cite=CGT]). Conformal gauge theory is very attractive in the phenomenological point of view, since if it includes a SUSY-breaking sector, conformal sequestering [\cite=LS] [\cite=Dine] of the SUSY breaking may occur, providing a solution to the flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) problem in the supersymmetric standard model (SSM). It is tempting to consider vector-like gauge theories for the SUSY breaking, since they are naturally incorporated into vector-like superconformal gauge theories, which are relatively well understood.

In this paper we extend vector-like gauge theories for the SUSY breaking [\cite=IYIT] by adding massive hyperquarks to turn the full high-energy theory above the mass threshold into conformal gauge theory. We find, however, that this simple extension does not achieve the conformal sequestering due to the presence of an unwanted global U(1) symmetry. To eliminate the unwanted global symmetry we introduce non-abelian gauge interactions acting on the additional massive hyperquarks. We find various examples realizing the sequestering.

We first discuss SP(3N + 1)  ×  SP(N)6 gauge theories where all gauge coupling constants at the infrared fixed point are small for N > 1 and perturbative calculations are applicable. We show by an explicit one-loop calculation that the theories have non-trivial fixed points and the sequestering of the SUSY-breaking effects indeed occurs. However, the sequestering is too mild to be applied to the phenomenology, since all the couplings are weak. Therefore, we dwell on strongly coupled conformal gauge theory such as an SP(3)  ×  SP(1)2 theory in this paper.

We also propose a Planck-suppressed gauge mediation which circumvents the tachyonic mass problem for sleptons in anomaly mediation. Owing to the gravitational nature of this gauge mediation, the size of the gauge-mediated SUSY breaking is at most comparable to the anomaly-mediation effects. For the lowest messenger scale, the total model provides a hybrid scheme [\cite=Nomura] of anomaly [\cite=Murayama] and gauge [\cite=Rattazzi] mediations of SUSY breaking.

Conformal SUSY breaking

The IYIT model [\cite=IYIT] for SUSY breaking is based on an SP(N) gauge theory with 2(N + 1) chiral superfields (hyperquarks), Qiα, in the fundamental (2N-dimensional) representation. Here, [formula] and [formula]. We introduce (N + 1)(2N + 1) gauge singlet chiral superfields, Sij( =  - Sji), and impose the flavor SU(2N + 2) symmetry in the superpotential,

[formula]

where Sij are assumed to transform as an antisymmetric (N  +  1)(2N  +  1) representation of the flavor SU(2N + 2) and we omit the color indices for simplicity. The reason why we impose the SU(2N + 2) symmetry becomes clear in the next section.

The effective low-energy superpotential is given by

[formula]

in terms of gauge invariant low-energy degrees of freedom Vij  ~  QiQj. Here, X is an additional chiral superfield and Λ denotes a dynamical scale of the SP(N) gauge interaction. We see that the superfields Sij have non-vanishing F terms in the vacuum and the SUSY is spontaneously broken. Notice here that the model possesses a U(1)R symmetry in addition to the flavor SU(2N + 2).

conformality

Now let us introduce 2nF massive hyperquarks, Q'k, where [formula]. The mass term is written as

[formula]

Here, i runs from 1 to nF. Above this mass scale, the high-energy theory is an SP(N) gauge theory with NF = 2(N + 1) + 2nF hyperquarks. The SUSY SP(N) gauge theory with NF hyperquarks is expected to be scale-invariant in the infrared for 3(N + 1) < NF  <  6(N + 1) [\cite=Seiberg].

We check, in the following, that the theory with the superpotential Eq.([\ref=eq:tree]) can also be scale-invariant in the infrared. The NSVZ beta function [\cite=NSVZ] relates the running of the canonical gauge coupling constant to the anomalous dimension factors, γQ and γQ', of the hyperquarks, Q and Q', as

[formula]

where αg is defined in terms of the gauge coupling constant g of SP(N) as αg = g2 / (4π) and μ denotes the renormalization scale. Here and hereafter in this section, we neglect the masses of the hyperquarks Q'k. The beta function of the Yukawa coupling constant in Eq.([\ref=eq:tree]) is also given in terms of the anomalous dimension factors of the hyperquarks, γQ, and of the singlet chiral fields, γS, by

[formula]

where αλ is defined in terms of the Yukawa coupling constant λ as αλ  =  λ2 / (4π).

When the theory is scale-invariant with non-vanishing coupling constants, the beta functions in Eqs.([\ref=eq:betaG1]) and ([\ref=eq:betaY1]) vanish. That is, we have, at the infrared fixed point,

[formula]

These conditions determine the anomalous dimensions at the fixed point. The anomalous dimensions at the fixed point are consistent with the unitarity of the theory for

[formula]

which comes from the restriction for unitary representation of the superconformal algebra [\cite=SC]: the above anomalous dimensions are consistent with the unitarity conditions for any gauge-singlet chiral multiplets such as QQ, Q'Q', and S.

Notice that the vanishing of the NSVZ beta function is consistent with the existence of the anomaly free U(1)R symmetry that enters in the superconformal algebra with the charges of the matter fields given by Ri  =  (2 + γi) / 3; i = Q,Q',S [\cite=SC]. In this simple extension of the IYIT model, the anomalous dimensions cannot be determined uniquely from Eqs.([\ref=eq:fixedG1]) and ([\ref=eq:fixedY1]), and hence, the charge assignment of the U(1)R is not determined only with this information.

Now, we show by a perturbative calculation that the fixed point is infrared stable. We first see that the gauge and Yukawa coupling constants at the infrared fixed point are small if NF is just below 6(N + 1), as in the case of the Banks-Zaks fixed point [\cite=BZ]. In this case we can obtain the anomalous dimensions at the one-loop level as

[formula]

For nF  =  2(N + 1) - ε, we determine the coupling constants at the fixed point from Eqs.([\ref=eq:fixedG1]) and ([\ref=eq:fixedY1]), as

[formula]

and the one-loop approximation is justified a posteriori for small ε / N.

We can explicitly examine the infrared stability of the fixed point by considering the renormalizaiton group (RG) evolutions near the fixed point. The RG equations of the small deviations,

[formula]

are given by

[formula]

where βG and βλ denote the beta functions of αg and αλ given by Eqs.([\ref=eq:betaG1]) and ([\ref=eq:betaY1]), respectively, and the values with the subscript "*  " are evaluated at the fixed point. By using Eqs.([\ref=eq:anomQ1])-([\ref=eq:solY1]), we find that all the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix {∂βk  /  ∂αl} are positive at the fixed point in Eqs.([\ref=eq:solG1]) and ([\ref=eq:solY1]), where k,l  =  g,λ. Therefore, the fixed point in Eqs.([\ref=eq:solG1]) and ([\ref=eq:solY1]) is infrared stable at least against small deviations from the fixed point.

non-sequestering

We are at the point to show that the sequestering of the SUSY breaking does not occur due to an unwanted global U(1) symmetry in this simple extension. By following Luty and Sundrum [\cite=LS], we consider the RG evolutions of the wave function renormalization factors near the fixed point,

[formula]

where i = Q,Q',S and γ*i are the anomalous dimensions at the fixed point given by Eqs.([\ref=eq:anomQ1])-([\ref=eq:anomS1]). Here, M* denotes the scale where the theory enters the conformal regime below the reduced Planck scale MG≃2.4  ×  1018 GeV. The deviations from the fixed point can be parameterized by [formula] and [formula] which, in turn, can be expressed as

[formula]

By using the above expressions, we rewrite the RG equation Eq.([\ref=eq:sequester1]) as

[formula]

and we define the coefficient matrix Lij by

[formula]

When all the eigenvalues of L are positive, all [formula] go to zero as t  →    -    ∞   (the infrared limit) and hence the SUSY breaking is sequestered [\cite=LS] [\cite=Dine]. Unfortunately, we find that the coefficient matrix L has a zero eigenvalue. Thus, one linear combination of [formula] is constant in the course of the RG evolution and it is not suppressed at the infrared fixed point. We call it as [formula]. Since the vanishing eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector [formula], we find that the solution to the Eq.([\ref=eq:sequester2_2]) in the infrared limit is

[formula]

with an O(1) proportionality factor, where [formula] denotes the value at t = 0. In general, the initial value [formula] contains visible sector superfields qi as weakly coupled spectators such as

[formula]

where κab denote O(1) coefficients. Therefore, from Eq.([\ref=eq:solS1]), we find that the SUSY breaking effects to the visible sector are not sequestered.

The reason of our failure can be traced to the existence of a global U(1) symmetry [\cite=LS] [\cite=Dine] under which the SUSY breaking superfield Sij transforms non-trivially. In general, when an anomaly-free (non-R) U(1) symmetry exists, the charge assignment ωi determines the eigenvector of the coefficient matrix Lij for a vanishing eigenvalue:

[formula]

In the present case, a linear combination [formula] (of [formula]) remains constant in the infrared limit and the SUSY breaking effects are not sequestered if the SUSY breaking superfields have non-vanishing charges. The eigenvector we have found above corresponds to the charge assignment (ωQ,ωQ',ωS) = (1, - (N + 1) / nF, - 2) of an anomaly-free U(1) symmetry. Thus, in order to realize the sequestering, we should violate the global U(1) symmetry under which the SUSY breaking superfields transform non-trivially, provided we do not take [formula] by fine tuning. In the next section, we introduce additional gauge symmetries, where the unwanted U(1) symmetry is broken by anomaly due to the new gauge interactions.

Conformally sequestered extensions

We introduce gauge interactions acting on the massive hyperquarks, Q'k, where the unwanted global U(1) symmetry is broken by anomaly due to the new gauge interactions. We deal, in this section, with SP(N)  ×  SP(N')6, (N = 3N' + 1) gauge theory, where the former SP(N) corresponds to the gauge group for the SUSY breaking and the latter SP(N')6 gauge group is introduced to break the unwanted U(1) symmetry. We list all the matter contents in Table [\ref=tab:content]. We take such a large gauge group to see explicitly by a perturbative calculation that the conformal sequestering occurs. Indeed all the couplings at the infrared fixed point are weak for N' > 1 in the present model.

conformality

Now, we check that the theory with the extended gauge symmetry can be scale-invariant in the infrared. In this model, the beta functions of the SP(N) gauge coupling constant αg, the SP(N') gauge coupling constant αg', and the Yukawa coupling constant αλ in Eq.([\ref=eq:tree]) are given by

[formula]

where we have assumed that all the SP(N') sectors are equivalent. Namely, we have imposed an exchange symmetry between any two SP(N')'s in the SP(N')6 so that the SP(N')6 has a common gauge coupling constant αg'. Then, by requiring all the beta functions to vanish, we determine the anomalous dimensions uniquely as

[formula]

Here, we have neglected the masses of the hyperquarks Q'.

We also determine the coupling constants at the infrared fixed point by a perturbative calculation. The anomalous dimensions at the one-loop level are given by

[formula]

Then, Eqs.([\ref=eq:anomQ2])-([\ref=eq:anomS3]) determine the coupling constants at the infrared fixed point by

[formula]

We see that all the coupling constants are small and the perturbative calculation is reliable for N'  >  1.

The above result enables us to explicitly analyze the infrared stability of the fixed point in the same way as done in the previous section. The RG equations of the small deviations [formula] are given by

[formula]

where the coefficient matrix M is defined by

[formula]

Here, "*  " indicates the values evaluated at the fixed point. If all the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix are positive, the fixed point in Eqs.([\ref=eq:alphaG2])-([\ref=eq:alphaL2]) is infrared stable. In Table [\ref=tab:stability], we show numerical results on the eigenvalues of the matrix M for the case of N' > 1. >From the table, we see that eigenvalues are all positive for N' > 1. Therefore, we find that the SP(3N' + 1)  ×  SP(N')6 gauge theory has the stable infrared fixed point in Eqs.([\ref=eq:anomQ2])-([\ref=eq:anomS2]).

sequestering

We now discuss the sequestering of the SUSY breaking. The RG equations of the wave function renormalization factors Zi near the fixed point are given by

[formula]

Here, the coefficient matrix L in the second line is given by using the following relations:

[formula]

The sequestering of the SUSY breaking is realized when all the eigenvalues of L are positive.

Interestingly, as we show below, the coefficient matrix L has the same eigenvalues as the coefficient matrix M in Eq.([\ref=eq:matrixM]). Therefore, the sequestering occurs automatically, if the infrared fixed point determined in Eqs.([\ref=eq:anomQ2])-([\ref=eq:anomS2]) is stable. To prove that, we rewrite the conditions for the vanishing beta functions as

[formula]

where the coefficient matrix A and the vector b can be read off from Eqs.([\ref=eq:betaG2])-([\ref=eq:betaY2]) and k = g,g',λ. Then, we see the following relations:

[formula]

where we have defined

[formula]

Since the coefficient matrix A is invertible, the coefficient matrices M and L are similar to each other, so that they have the same eigenvalues. Therefore, the sequestering occurs automatically when the anomalous dimensions are uniquely determined by the conditions for the vanishing beta functions (i.e. A is invertible) and the fixed point is infrared stable (i.e. all the eigenvalues of M are positive). Notice that this is no accident: the conformal sequestering originates from nothing but the attractor structure of the infrared fixed point.

In our SP(3N' + 1)  ×  SP(N')6 model, we have shown that the fixed point is determined from the conditions of vanishing beta functions and the fixed point is infrared stable for N' > 1. Thus, we have found that the sequestering is realized in our model. Notice that the relation between the infrared stability and the sequestering holds independently of the perturbative calculation. Therefore, even if perturbative analysis is not applicable, we may argue that the sequestering occurs, if the fixed point is expected to be infrared stable.

It should be noted here that the unwanted global U(1) symmetry discussed in the previous section is broken by anomalies of the SP(N')6 gauge interactions and hence there is no conserved U(1) current. This is the reason why the matrix M does not have a zero eigenvalue.

In addition to the above global U(1) symmetry, there are many unbroken global U(1)'s acting on the gauge singlet superfields Sij, which consist of the U(1) subgroups of the flavor SU(2N + 2) of the hyperquarks Qi. Thus, there are many linear combinations of the wave function renormalization factors which are not sequestered in the course of the RG evolutions to the infrared fixed point. For example, a linear combination [formula] is not sequestered, since this corresponds to the global U(1)   ⊂   SU(2N  +  2) symmetry. Fortunately, we can make such non-sequestered combinations vanishing by imposing the flavor SU(2N + 2) symmetry (or a sufficiently large discrete subgroup thereof) at high energies so that the conformal sequestering of the SUSY breaking is realized. Namely, by assuming that the Kähler potential inducing soft masses for squarks and sleptons is restricted by the flavor SU(2N + 2) symmetry as

[formula]

we can set the linear combinations of [formula]'s which are not sequestered to be zero. Then, as we have discussed, the remaining combinations of [formula]'s are sequestered and the squared masses of the sfermions from Eq.([\ref=eq:SUGRAmass]) are suppressed at the infrared fixed point. This is the reason why we have imposed the flavor SU(2N + 2) symmetry in the SUSY-breaking sector.

Finally, in the rest of this section, we show that the sequestering is too mild in the present model to solve the FCNC problem. In view of the Table [\ref=tab:stability], the smallest eigenvalue β'* of the coefficient matrix L (or equivalently M) is of the order of 10- 3 for N'  ≥  2. Thus, the linear combination of [formula] that corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue approaches to the fixed point very slowly, which, in turn, prevents [formula] from getting up to the fixed point immediately. That is, in the infrared regime (t  ≪  0), we find

[formula]

where [formula] corresponds to the eigenvector for the smallest eigenvalue, the subscript "0" indicates the value at t = 0, and ci denote numerical coefficients. By explicit calculation, we find that the coefficients ci are typically O(0.1 - 0.01) in our perturbative models. In order to solve the FCNC problem by sequestering, we should require [formula] at the SUSY-breaking scale [\cite=Gabbiani:1996hi]. Thus, without fine tuning among ln Zi, we should require [formula]. However, since β*' is of the order of 10- 3, it takes too long to achieve the sufficient sequestering. Therefore, we find that the sufficient sequestering cannot be expected in our perturbative models.

In the perturbative examples, we have seen that the size of the "sequestering speed" β*' is not larger than the anomalous dimensions at the fixed point. Thus, in order to realize the sufficient sequestering (i.e. β*'  =  O(1)), we should require that the anomalous dimensions at the fixed point are of the order one. This means that we must consider a strongly coupled conformal gauge theory. In the next section, we discuss such a strongly coupled theory and present the reason why we consider the sequestering might be also realized there, although the perturbative calculation is not applicable.

Strongly coupled SP(3)  ×  SP(1)2 model

In this section, we discuss SP(3)  ×  SP(1)2 gauge theory as an example, where SP(3) corresponds to the gauge group for the SUSY breaking and the SP(1)2 gauge group acts on massive hyperquarks Q'k. We list the matter contents in Table [\ref=tab:content2]. We assume that such a gauge theory with the Yukawa interaction in Eq.([\ref=eq:tree]) has a non-trivial fixed point. Then, the anomalous dimensions for Q,Q', and S at the fixed point are determined as

[formula]

which sit on a boundary of the unitarity bound Eq.([\ref=eq:unitarityS]).

In Table [\ref=tab:strong], we list some other examples of the SP(N)  ×  SP(N')2 gauge theories, which include the cases where the perturbative analysis is marginally applicable. In such examples with gauge symmetry structures similar to SP(3)  ×  SP(1)2, we can explicitly check that the fixed points are infrared stable. Thus, based on these results (i.e. consistency with the unitarity and the presence of similar but calculable examples), we expect that the fixed point with Eq.([\ref=eq:fixed3]) is infrared stable, although it is hard to check it by an explicit calculation.

Now, we discuss the sequestering of the SUSY breaking effects in the strongly coupled SP(3)  ×  SP(1)2 model. As argued in the previous section, if the anomalous dimensions are determined uniquely from the conditions for the vanishing beta functions, then the sequestering is equivalent to the infrared stability of the fixed point. Hence, once we assume that the fixed point with Eq.([\ref=eq:fixed3]) is infrared stable, the sequestering is guaranteed. By assuming that the "sequestering speed" β*' is not so far from the values of γi (see Eqs.([\ref=eq:sequester3])-([\ref=eq:deviation2])), we expect β*'  =  O(1) in our strongly coupled model. The flavor-changing soft masses are sufficiently suppressed by sequestering at the energy scale μ as high as

[formula]

When the RG scale μ comes close to the physical mass scale mphys of Q', the theory ceases to be scale invariant and effectively becomes an asymptotically free SP(3) gauge theory of strong coupling with 8 hyperquarks Q, and finally SUSY is broken dynamically at [formula]. Here, the physical mass is given by

[formula]

where the last equality results from the unitarity boundary value γQ' =  - 1 in the present model. Thus, the above condition Eq.([\ref=eq:SQscale]) for the sufficient sequestering can be rewritten in terms of the mass scale of Q' or the SUSY breaking scale Λ as

[formula]

As discussed in the next section, we are interested in the case where the gravitino mass is of the order of 100 TeV, which implies Λ  ~  1011 - 12 GeV. Thus, we claim that the above conditions can be satisfied for β*'  =  O(1), and hence, the FCNC can be suppressed in the present strongly coupled model.

Circumventing the tachyonic slepton problem

If the sequestering of SUSY breaking occurs sufficiently, the SUSY-breaking masses for the squarks and sleptons become negligibly small at low energies. In this situation we must invoke some mechanism to transmit sizable SUSY-breaking effects to the visible sector of the SSM. The most natural candidate is anomaly mediation [\cite=Murayama]. This mechanism is not only theoretically interesting, but also phenomenologically attractive. This is because the gravitino mass is expected at O(100) TeV, which provides us with a solution to the gravitino problem [\cite=moroi] [\cite=ibe]. However, the anomaly mediation mechanism suffers from the tachyonic slepton mass problem [\cite=Murayama].

In this section we consider a Planck-suppressed gauge mediation to remedy this phenomenological defect of the anomaly mediation. Let us introduce a messenger sector which consists of chiral superfields ψ, [formula], ψ', and '. Here, ψ , and ψ' ,' transform as vector-like representations under the gauge group of the SSM, and we take them to fit in complete SU(5) GUT representations, [formula], for simplicity.

Our additional superpotential terms are given by

[formula]

which let the SUSY breaking intact for a sufficiently large mass parameter mm. Here, h denotes a coupling constant of order one and the combination SijQiQj stands just for a SUSY-breaking superpotential term which has a non-vanishing F component (see Eq.([\ref=eq:dynamical])). The SUSY-breaking effects are transmitted to the sfermions and Higgs bosons by the SSM gauge interactions (see Ref.[\cite=Tobe]).

In the SUSY-breaking dynamics, we expect [formula] [\cite=Hotta], which yields only Planck-suppressed R breaking effects in the gauge mediation. In this case, gauginos do not obtain sizable SUSY-breaking masses via the gauge mediation and the gaugino spectrum is virtually the same as in the purely anomaly-mediated one. On the other hand, the scalar field φ obtains the mass squared via the gauge mediation for mm  <  mphys as

[formula]

where Cφa(a = 1,2,3) is the quadratic Casimir invariant for each gauge group relevant to the scalar φ. In the above equation, we have used [formula] and the gravitino mass m3 / 2 given by

[formula]

As a result, we find that the gauge-mediated masses squared are comparable to the anomaly mediated ones for mm  ~  m3 / 2. In particular, the positive contributions to the slepton masses squared in Eq.([\ref=eq:GMmass]),

[formula]

can overwhelm the negative contribution of the anomaly-mediated mass squared,

[formula]

Therefore, we conclude that the tachyonic slepton problem is resolved in the total model of anomaly and gauge mediation hybrid by tunning scales of these two mediations with each other.

Note that the newly added superpotential term in Eq.([\ref=eq:GM1]) does not violate the global SU(2N + 2) symmetry which is relevant for the conformal sequestering. Hence, we can apply the above mechanism to the conformally sequestered models. However, we should note that in the case of conformally sequestered models, the first term in Eq.([\ref=eq:GM1]) is also sequestered in the course of the RG evolution from M* to mphys. Thus, in order to realize the sizable gauge mediation effects as in Eq.([\ref=eq:GMse]), we need to compensate the sequestering effects by preparing the additional superpotential terms

[formula]

at the scale M* which effectively realize the Eq.([\ref=eq:GM1]) after the conformal sequestering. This implies that the higher-dimensional term stems from integrating out an intermediate matter of mass (mphys  /  M * )β'*MG with Planck-suppressed coupling to SijQiQj. In the above analysis, we have simply used Eq.([\ref=eq:GM1]) as a resultant effective superpotential at the scale mphys for the conformally sequestered models.

Finally, we comment on the cosmologcal aspects of this class of models. Since the relic density of the lightest messenger particle is too much to be consistent with the observation, we should require that they decay into the SSM particles at early stage of the universe. This is implemented by introducing small mixings between the messenger particles and the SSM particles. In addition, it should also be noted that there are Goldstone bosons in the SUSY breaking sector, which correspond to the spontaneous breaking of the global SU(2N + 2) symmetry. However, those massless particles are decoupled from the thermal bath since they only couple with the SSM particles via the Planck-supressed operator, and hence they do not affect the history of the universe. Therefore, we find that the present hybrid scheme yields also a consistent scenario from the cosmological point of view.

Anomalous dimensions from a-maximization

Recently, Intriligator and Wecht proposed a powerful technique to compute the conformal R current in a certain class of conformal field theories in four dimensions and hence the anomalous dimensions thereof [\cite=Intriligator:2003jj]. In this appendix we use this so-called a-maximization method to determine the anomalous dimensions of the fields in the conformally extended IYIT model beyond the Banks-Zaks approximation presented in section 3.

The a-maximization method simply states that the conformal R current appearing in the superconformal algebra maximizes a particular t'Hooft anomaly

[formula]

which is related to the conformal anomaly on a curved spacetime

[formula]

In our model of the SP(N) gauge theory, the candidate of the conformal R current contains one free parameter x = γQ, from which the corresponding R charges are determined by Eqs.([\ref=eq:fixedG1]) and ([\ref=eq:fixedY1]) as

[formula]

with

[formula]

where ε  =  2(N + 1) - nF.

The claim is that among these one-parameter R currents, the conformal one maximizes the anomaly a, which is obtained as follows:

[formula]

where we note that the R charges appearing in a are those of fermions (i.e. RψQ  =  RQ - 1) because only fermions contribute to the anomaly. By maximizing a with respect to x, we can determine x*  =  γQ|*. The unique local maximum is achieved by setting

[formula]

To compare this rather complicated expression with the perturbative results, we expand Eq.([\ref=horrible]) in terms of ε. Remarkably, the first order approximation is given by

[formula]

which completely agrees with our Banks-Zaks-like calculation. Furthermore we can systematically study higher order corrections. It is quite intriguing that the a-maximization determines all-order loop effects only from the one-loop result Eq.([\ref=a]).

We can also study a of the gauged version of extended IYIT model in section 3, which leads to conformal sequestering. Since the gauging enforces yet another constraint on the anomaly free R charge, we obtain a unique R charge assignment without using the a-maximization procedure. It is important to realize, following the general argument of the monotonically decreasing a, that [formula] is less than [formula]. This is obvious when [formula] is sufficiently close to [formula], since [formula] yields the local maximum of a(x). For example, we can show by a direct computation that a of the gauged extended IYIT model presented in section 3 is always less than that of the ungaged version presented in section 2 for a fixed gauge group. This result is consistent with the fact that our conformal fixed point is a stable one. In particular, it is worthwhile to notice that this is even true for N = 1 case, which cannot be treated in the one-loop approximation.

Finally, it would be an interesting but challenging problem to obtain the speed of the conformal sequestering from the interpolating a-function. In Ref.[\cite=Kutasov:2003ux], the off-shell a-function is proposed as solving a-maximization condition with a Lagrange multiplier ξ that enforces the constraint on the R charge:

[formula]

where R(ξ) is obtained by maximizing a with respect to R for fixed ξ, and the constraint is either ABJ anomaly free condition or the requirement that the superpotential be marginal. As was observed in [\cite=Kutasov:2003ux], the first derivative of a(ξ) is related to the β function of the coupling constant. Furthermore, the second derivative (Hessian) of a(ξ) at a fixed point ξ* is proportional to the slope of the β function

[formula]

Consequently there is a chance to read the conformal sequestering matrix without performing the explicit loop calculation even for a strongly coupled theory. Unfortunately, we do not know the proportionality factor (related to the denominator of the NSVZ beta function evaluated at the fixed point) and the transformation matrix {∂ξi  /  ∂gj} non-perturbatively, so we cannot determine the conformal sequestering matrix. Since the conformal sequestering matrix is a physical renormalization invariant quantity while a(ξ) is not, we need an off-shell scheme-independent a-function for our purposes.

Another example of the hybrid scheme

In section [\ref=sec:Phen], we have considered the hybrid model of the anomaly and gauge mediated SUSY breaking, which solves the tachyonic slepton problem in a pure anomaly mediation model. In this appendix, we propose another example of the hybrid model which can be constructed with renormalizable interactions between the SUSY breaking sector and the messenger sector. That is, in addition to the anomaly mediated SUSY breaking, we consider the gauge mediated SUSY breaking discussed in Ref. [\cite=Tobe], where messenger sector consists of Nm flavors of chiral superfields ψi and j [formula] and Nm flavors of chiral superfields ψ'i and 'j [formula]. Here, ψi, ψ'i and j, 'j transform as [formula] and *   of SU(5) GUT, respectively. Then, with the superpotential,

[formula]

the SUSY-breaking effects are transmitted to the sfermions and Higgs bosons by the gauge interactions. Here, h denotes the coupling constant, mm the mass parameter, and we assume that h  =  h0 of order one at [formula]. As discussed in section [\ref=sec:seq], we impose the global SU(2N + 2) symmetry to the SUSY breaking sector, and in order for the interaction in Eq.([\ref=eq:gmint]) to respect this symmetry, we assume that Nm = 2(N + 1) and ψ, [formula] and ψ', ' transform as [formula] and [formula] representations, respectively, of the SU(2N + 2).

In this case, the scalar field φ obtains the mass squared via the gauge mediation, and at the messenger scale, it is given by,

[formula]

Here, we have used RG evolution of hFS,

[formula]

where subscripts (mm,mphys) denote the RG scale. Furthermore, in the course of RG running, the scalar mass squared is suppressed by a factor of η which denotes the sequestering effects between the scales mm and mphys,

[formula]

For example, for the SP(3)  ×  SP(1)2 model, the positive contribution to the slepton masses squared in Eq.([\ref=eq:GMmass2]) is given by

[formula]

where we are using γS  =  2 and are assuming h0 = 1. Thus, when mm satisfies

[formula]

this contribution overcomes the negative contribution from the anomaly mediated mass squared in Eq.([\ref=eq:AMse]). Therefore, we find that this hybrid model also provides a solution to the tachyonic slepton problem with an appropriate choice of the mass scale of messengers.
