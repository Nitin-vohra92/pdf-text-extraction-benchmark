The inelastic relaxation time due to electron-electron collisions in high-mobility two-dimensional systems under microwave radiations

The thermalization time τth, i.e. the time needed for system to approach the thermoequilibrium state, is an important property of an electron system in an nonequilibrium state. Though almost all the scattering mechanisms can contribute to τth, in many cases electron-electron scattering is the dominant one for thermalization, and the "inelastic relaxation time" τin due to electron-electron (ee) scattering in the nonequilibrium state can be approximately considered as τth. This τin has also served as an important parameter in several theoretical models of microwave-induced magnetoresistance oscillation in high-mobility two-dimensional systems. These models make use of the Boltzmann-type transport equation for the distribution function f with the ee collision term written in the form

[formula]

where f0 is the equilibrium distribution function, i.e. the distribution function in the absence of radiation at lattice temperature T. Most of the existing treatments in the literature assume, explicitly or implicitly, that the distribution function f only slightly deviates from f0, such that τin can essentially be evaluated using the equilibrium distribution function f0 and get at low temperature T

[formula]

with EF the Fermi energy of the two-dimensional (2D) electron system. For GaAs-based 2D electron system of carrier density Ne = 3  ×  1015 m- 2, this yields

[formula]

which is of the same order of magnitude as the disorder-limited inverse momentum (transport) relaxation time 1 / τm  ≈  10  mK if the system linear mobility is μ0 = 2000 m2/Vs, and may be much smaller than the inverse single-particle life-time, 1 / τq, which can be as large as 0.5 K. The condition τin  ≫  τq has been used as a key point in many theoretical treatments in the literature.

However, for ultra-clean (high-mobility) 2D electron systems under microwave irradiation of strength capable of producing photoresistance oscillation, the nonequilibrium distribution function f remarkably deviates from f0 at low temperatures. The ee collision term in the transport equation generally can not be written in a form of Eq. (1). Even if, for an approximate analysis, one still takes Eq. (1) in the main equations, τin should be calculated using the nonequilibrium distribution function f rather than using f0. Though we may not know the exact nonequilibrium distribution function f under the influence of a strong electric field [formula], it is, in any case, much closer to the shifted function [formula] than to [formula], the equilibrium distribution function in the absence of electric field. Here [formula] stands for wavevector and [formula] is the drift velocity under electric field [formula]. With this nonequilibrium distribution function we have

[formula]

even at T=0 K. Here the excitation energy Δ can be as large as

[formula]

For the system of μ0 = 2000 m2/Vs subject to an electric field of Es = 0.5 V/cm, vd  ≈  105 m/s, Δm  ≈  80 K and 1 / τin can be as high as 20 K, with an average around

[formula]

Which is not only much larger than 1 / τm  ≈  10  mK but also much larger than 1 / τq  ≈  0.5  K.

Therefore, models which depend heavily on the assumption 1 / τin  ≫  1 / τq may not be justifiable, even without considering other mechanisms for system thermalization.
