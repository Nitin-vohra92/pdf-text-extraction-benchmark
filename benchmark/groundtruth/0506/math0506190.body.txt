Introduction

In the set of real quaternions there are an infinite number of square roots of - 1, since [formula] for any unit pure quaternion [formula] [\cite=arXiv:math.RA/0506034]. This paper explores the question: what are the roots of - 1 in the biquaternions, or complexified quaternions, [formula]. More formally, what is the set of complexified quaternions [formula]?

Biquaternions, or complexified quaternions, may be represented as quaternions with complex components, or as complex numbers with quaternion real and imaginary parts, [\cite=Ward:1997]:

[formula]

The two representations are equivalent, and conversion between them is straightforward, for example: [formula], where S(  ) represents the scalar part of a quaternion and [formula] is the complex operator; and [formula], where [formula] is the real part of a complex number. Note that the complex operator commutes with the three quaternion operators [formula] and therefore with all real quaternions.

We choose to use in this paper the second representation above (a complex number with a real quaternion real part and a real quaternion imaginary part), and further we represent each of the real quaternions by a pair of real numbers and a unit pure quaternion:

[formula]

This choice makes transparent the solution of the problem at hand, since there are geometric constraints on the unit pure quaternions, as will be seen, although it hides the fact that each complexified quaternion has eight real components (each of the two unit pure quaternions has arbitrary direction in 3-space).

Solution

Let q be an arbitrary biquaternion (complexified quaternion) represented in the form:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are unit pure real quaternions, is the complex imaginary operator (therefore [formula]), and a, b, c and d are real. Then the following solutions, and no others, exist for q2 =  - 1:

[formula]

The last two solutions are degenerate. The first solution is the only one in which q is a complexified quaternion. Note that the constraint on the moduli of b and d in the first solution means that they are related as hyperbolic sine and cosine by the identity: cosh 2t  -   sinh 2t  =  1 and therefore the moduli of the two pure quaternions can be expressed by the single parameter t.

The number of possible complexified quaternion solutions to q2 =  - 1 is infinite, since we can choose [formula] anywhere on the unit sphere. There are also an infinite number of choices for [formula] in the plane perpendicular to the chosen [formula]. We can also choose the moduli of the two unit vectors in an infinite number of ways to satisfy the constraint b2  -  d2  =  1.

The proof first shows that the above solutions are roots of - 1. We then show that there are no other solutions by enumeration of the terms obtained when we square q. The terms are grouped into those that are real (which must sum to - 1), those that are real quaternions (which must sum to zero) and those that are complex quaternions (which must also sum to zero). Analysis of the constraints yields the solutions given above and demonstrates that no other solutions exist.

It was shown in [\cite=arXiv:math.RA/0506034] that any unit pure quaternion is a root of - 1, and therefore the unit pure quaternion [formula] is a root of - 1. [formula] is a root of - 1 by definition.

To show that the first solution is a root of - 1, we square it, remembering that b, d and [formula] commute with [formula] and [formula], but that [formula] and [formula] do not commute:

[formula]

The term in brackets is zero because the two unit vectors are perpendicular. The constraint that b2  -  d2  =  1 gives us q2 =  - 1.

We now demonstrate that no other solutions exist. Tabulating the terms obtained when we square q we obtain the following:

[formula]

Note that if q2  =   - 1:

The four diagonal terms are the only ones that are elements of and they must sum to - 1.

The two off-diagonal terms in the upper left quadrant ([formula]) are the only terms that are elements of and since they have the same sign, they must be zero. This implies either a  =  0 or [formula]. These two cases are considered separately below.

All the remaining terms contain and must therefore sum to zero.

We now consider the two possibilities a  =  0 or [formula] which are necessary but not sufficient conditions to give q2  =   - 1:

The three diagonal terms must sum to - 1 and the coefficients of must sum to zero. This gives us a pair of simultaneous equations, the first in real numbers and the second in real quaternions:

Considering the second of these two equations, expressing the products of the two unit vectors in terms of dot and cross products we are able to equate scalar and vector parts separately to zero:

The scalar part can only be zero if the two unit vectors are perpendicular or if one or both of b and d is zero. Considering each possibility in turn:

We show that this does not lead to any new roots of - 1 (the only result is [formula], which we already have above). We retabulate the terms in the product with the second row and column suppressed:

[formula]

The three diagonal terms must sum to - 1 and the coefficients of must sum to zero. Dividing out a factor of two in the second case, and collecting terms we have:

[formula]

Hence we require: ac  =  0 and either a + c = 0 or [formula]. Considering these possibilities in turn:

Numerical examples

The non-trivial result given above is not intuitive, so we include three numeric examples.

We can choose [formula] and [formula] as examples of unit vectors that are perpendicular, and choose the modulus of one to be [formula] and the modulus of the other to be unity so that the difference of the squared moduli is unity (note that b must be greater than d): [formula]. We then have:

[formula]

As a second example, we choose [formula] and [formula]. To show that these are perpendicular it is only necessary to compute their dot product [formula]:

[formula]

and it is simple to see that each has unit modulus. We choose the moduli to be [formula] and [formula], satisfying b2 - d2 = 1. Thus [formula]. Tabulating the product terms when q is squared:

[formula]

Inspection of this table shows that all the terms cancel out, bar a solitary - 1.

For our third example, we use the same two unit vectors, but in the opposite order, and choose moduli of 3 and [formula]. The difference between these squared moduli is again unity (note that we could choose two much larger moduli, provided the difference between their squares is unity). Thus [formula]. Squaring q we obtain:

[formula]

which is - 1 because the term in the brackets vanishes, [formula] and [formula] being perpendicular, as is easily verified by multiplying out [formula].
