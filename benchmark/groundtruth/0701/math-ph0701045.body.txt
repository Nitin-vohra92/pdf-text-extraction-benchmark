An Extended Abel-Jacobi Map

Introduction.

The purpose of this note is to present and invert an extension of the classical Abel-Jacobi theorem that was recently encountered in the construction of nonabelian magnetic monopoles [\cite=be06] and also appeared in the linearization of integrable systems on finite-dimensional unreduced coadjoint orbits on various loop algebras ([\cite=AHH_CMP] [\cite=Gavr] [\cite=Gag] [\cite=RST]). We believe this extension is of independent interest and will now describe it, placing it in context.

Let Γ be a Riemann surface of genus g with a canonical homology basis [formula] and holomorphic differentials [formula] normalized so that [formula]. (We follow the conventions of [\cite=fk80].) Let Λ be the rank 2g lattice in [formula] generated by the vectors of periods of ω with respect to [formula] and [formula] be the Jacobian of the curve Γ. The Abel map [formula] gives a well defined holomorphic map of Γ into J(Γ) that may be extended to a map of divisors. Abel's theorem identifies the divisor of a meromorphic function on Γ with degree zero divisors in the kernel of A and Jacobi's (inversion) theorem says that every point on the Jacobian J(Γ) is expressible as the image under the Abel map of a positive divisor of degree g: that is, for all [formula] we may find [formula] such that

[formula]

Analytically this inversion makes use of Riemann's theta function. The Abel-Jacobi theorems play a central role in the theory of Riemann surfaces and find important application in the solution of integrable systems. The modern approach to integrability places special attention on algebraically completely integrable systems: systems whose real invariant tori may be extended to complex algebraic tori (Abelian varieties) related to an algebraic curve and whose complex phase flows become straight line motion on the tori. A Lax equation, for example, will frequently result in a curve Γ, the relevant Abelian variety is the Jacobian J(Γ) and the dynamics is linearizable on the Jacobian. In this setting the physical solution is obtained by solving the Jacobi inversion problem.

Although many known integrable systems fit into the framework just described, some extensions have been required over the years. In particular, if one wishes to describe the rotation matrices of some integrable tops ([\cite=BBEIM] [\cite=Gav_Z] [\cite=fed99]) or to obtain asymptotic (heteroclinic) solutions (such us umbilic geodesic trajectories on a triaxial ellipsoid) ([\cite=Er] [\cite=fed99]), one arrives at quadratures that, in addition to the holomorphic differentials already noted, involve various meromorphic differentials of the third kind, ΩP+,P-, with simple poles at P± and having residues [formula]. Clebsch and Gordan [\cite=cg86] described an appropriate extension of Abel-Jacobi theory to take these into account. Namely, suppose [formula] are distinct pairs of points on Γ and ΩXi,Yi the corresponding differentials of the third kind. We will assume throughout that such differentials are normalized to have vanishing a periods. Then (for [formula]) the extended Abel map [formula] admits the inversion of

[formula]

In this setting the Jacobian of Γ is replaced by a noncompact Abelian variety, an algebraic group, and generalized theta functions replace the Riemann theta function in the analytic inversion. This result may be viewed as a limit of the classical Abel-Jacobi theory for a genus g + s curve as s a-cycles pinch to zero resulting in a singular surface. ( The s = 1 account of this may be found in [\cite=fa73], for a more general case one can consult [\cite=fed99] [\cite=Al_Fed_Inverse].)

In this paper we consider a special degeneration of the map ([\ref=ext_aj]), when all the meromorphic differentials have a common pole. Namely, let [formula] be distinct points of our surface Γ and let [formula] be normalized meromorphic differentials of the third kind (with vanishing a periods) having pairs of simple poles at points [formula] respectively, and such that

[formula]

Let, as above, [formula] and [formula]. (Note that now there is no Z1-variable here.) Then (for [formula]) the extended Abel map [formula] admits the inversion of

[formula]

In our extension there is obvious overlap with the Clebsch-Gordan theory for s = 1 and n = 2. Note that the theta-functional formulas describing the inversion of ([\ref=ext_aj]) for s > 1 do not survive under the limit [formula]; the pinchings needed to view this result as a degeneration of the usual Abel-Jacobi theory are delicate (see also Remark 1 below). Apparently, the inversion problem in this case was not treated in the literature, and we will give a direct solution to this problem rather than consider such a limit.

A precise formulation of our result and the generalized theta functions which arise in the analytical inversion will be given in the next section. Here we remark that the extension ([\ref=genaj]) naturally appears in the linearization of integrable systems on finite-dimensional unreduced coadjoint orbits of various loop algebras (see, among others, [\cite=AHH_CMP] [\cite=Gavr] [\cite=RST]). The systems are described by n  ×  n matrix Lax pairs with a rational parameter, and the spectral curve Γ is an n-fold cover of [formula] with infinite points [formula]. The corresponding quadratures involve a complete set of g holomorphic differentials on Γ, as well as differentials with pairs of simple poles [formula]. For a generic choice of Darboux coordinates on the unreduced orbits, the quadratures describe evolution of a divisor of g + n - 1 finite points on Γ and thereby have the form ([\ref=genaj])

The same extension appears in algebraic completely integrable system associated to the BPS limit of su(2) magnetic monopoles and Γ is the attendant curve, which has a natural spatial interpretation [\cite=hitchin83]. In common with many such integrable systems, Baker-Akhiezer functions on the curve play a prominent role. Such functions are a slight extension to the class of meromorphic functions that allow essential singularities at a finite number [formula] of points; they have many properties similar to those of meromorphic functions. While for a meromorphic function one needs to prescribe g + 1 poles in the generic situation, a non-trivial Baker-Akhieser function exists with g arbitrarily prescribed poles on a surface of genus g. The construction of such functions may be made rather explicitly in terms of Riemann's theta function and involves an otherwise unspecified generic divisor of degree g + n - 1. In the monopole setting, a solution to the inversion problem ([\ref=genaj]) means that this unspecified divisor will have no physical consequences: such should be the case, and consequently led to the present theory developed in [\cite=be06].

Notation and Results

Let [formula] be the 4g-sided polygon with symbol [formula] obtained by dissecting Γ along the cycles of the chosen homology basis. We assume that our points Qi do not lie on any of our canonical cycles. Let γi be (disjoint) cycles around the points Qi lying in [formula] oriented so that [formula] and [formula] (for 2  ≤  i  ≤  n). Choose a point of ∂ as a vertex and let c denote the domain [formula] with (disjoint) cuts from this vertex to each of the points Qi. Then [formula] is single valued on c.

The generalized map A(P) has 2g + n - 1 independent period vectors corresponding to the 2g canonical cycles ai,bi and cycles [formula]. The factor of [formula] by the lattice generated by these vectors will be called the generalized Jacobian Jac[formula].

Introduce (for [formula]) the generalized theta function

[formula]

where, as above, [formula] is the customary Abel map and [formula] is the canonical Riemann theta-function with the Riemann period matrix τ of Γ,

[formula]

We will suppress throughout the dependence on τ. The vector K in ([\ref=VarTheta]) is the vector of Riemann constants (see e.g., [\cite=fa73]), while Ki ([formula]) are the following constants (fixed in our discussion below)

[formula]

Observe that for [formula] there is a recursive description

[formula]

We will establish two inversion theorems based on the function

[formula]

We first observe

Although f(P) is not single-valued on the curve Γ, its zeros do not depend on the choice of path in the Abel map A(P).

The differential d ln f(P) is regular at Q1 and has poles of residue - 1 at each of [formula].

The function f(P) has precisely g + n - 1 zeros (possibly with multiplicity).

With this our generalized inversion theorems are then

Let [formula] be such that the function [formula] does not vanish identically on [formula]. In this case, if ẑ is the right hand side of ([\ref=genaj]), the g + n - 1 zeros give a unique solution to the inversion of the extended map ([\ref=genaj]).

Let [formula] be such that [formula] does not vanish identically on [formula]. Then there exists a unique positive divisor [formula] such that

[formula]

Remark 1.

According to [\cite=cg86] [\cite=fed99], the inversion of the generalized map ([\ref=ext_aj]), that includes meromorphic differentials ΩXi,Yi with different poles, is given by zeros of the generalized theta-function

[formula]

which is represented by the sum of 2s terms, where [formula] is the b-period vector of ΩXlYl and Slr are given by As follows from ([\ref=Sij]), in the limit [formula], which transforms the extended map ([\ref=ext_aj]) to ([\ref=genaj]) with n = s + 1, the integrals Slr become infinite and the theta function [formula] becomes singular. Alternatively, one may try to divide the sum ([\ref=2s]) by certain exponents of Slr before taking the limit to obtain a finite expression instead. However, this procedure involves several delicate steps, which appeared to be more complicated than the direct approach proposed in this paper.

Our proof is inductive. In section 3 we will establish Theorem [\ref=genzeros] for the case n = 2. Section 4 contains the inductive step and completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=genzeros]. Here we also establish the formulae ([\ref=defki]) and give a proof of Theorem [\ref=gendiv] closing with some remarks on the generalized theta divisor. We conclude the section by proving Proposition [\ref=propquasi].

1). Our choice of normalization of the differentials ωi and Ωi1 together with the invariance [formula], where [formula] is the vector with 1 in the k-th entry and zero otherwise, says that f(P) is invariant as P encircles an a-cycle. Similarly encircling a γ-cycle at most changes the exponential factors by 2πi's and we again have invariance in this case. Finally consider encircling a b-cycle, say bk. The quasi-periodicity of the Riemann theta function

[formula]

means that the j-th term of the sum on the right-hand side of ([\ref=VarTheta]) changes by the phase

[formula]

Now the bilinear relation

[formula]

means this may be rewritten as

[formula]

and this is just the change of phase of the remaining term on the right-hand side of ([\ref=VarTheta]).

Therefore [formula] changes by the phase ([\ref=phasen]) and hence is a quasi-periodic function. The quasi-periodicity of f(P) means that although the function is not single-valued on the curve Γ its zeros do not depend on the choice of path in the Abel map A(P).

2). Next let us consider the behaviour of f(P) as P  ~  Qj ([formula]) focusing initially on the case [formula]. The i-th term in the sum of on the right-hand side of ([\ref=VarTheta]) for f(P) contains the exponential term [formula]. This is regular as P  →  Qj for j  ≠  i and so as P  ~  Qj Generically the coefficient α is non-vanishing. Now as P  ~  Qj (with local coordinates τ) and consequently

[formula]

has residue - 1 at Qj ([formula]). Finally, as P  ~  Q1 (with local coordinate τ) each of the exponential terms

[formula]

give a regular vanishing and so as P  ~  Q1

[formula]

Generically [formula] and this is regular at Q1 and hence has vanishing residue. Indeed, considering now all of ([\ref=VarTheta]), we find that

[formula]

Thus we have established that [formula] is regular at Q1 and has poles of residue - 1 at each of [formula].

3). To count the number of zero's we evaluate

[formula]

(upon noting that we encircle the Qi's in the opposite direction to the outer boundary). Now utilizing the residues just determined the second term in this expression contributes

[formula]

The first term on the other hand is simplified using the quasi-periodicity properties of part (1) of the proposition. Letting [formula] denote the value of f on the cycles [formula] or [formula] we have that if P lies on ak then from ([\ref=phasen])

[formula]

while if P is on bk then

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

and

[formula]

Together these yield

[formula]

and so the number of zeros of f(P) is then g + n - 1.

Clebsch's Case: n = 2

We now make the first step in the proof of Theorem 2.2. Namely, following [\cite=cg86], consider the extended Abel map [formula], defined by

[formula]

where P0  ≠  Q1,2. We are going to show that its inversion is given in terms of the generalized theta function that comes from ([\ref=VarTheta]), ([\ref=pars]),

[formula]

where

[formula]

That is, we now establish the n = 2 case of Theorem [\ref=genzeros].

Let ẑ be the right hand side of the extended map ([\ref=cleb2a]), ([\ref=cleb2b]) such that [formula] does not vanish identically on [formula]. Then f(P) has precisely g + 1 zeros (possibly with multiplicity) giving a unique solution to the inversion of the map.

Proof. The number of zeros and quasi-periodicity of f(P) have already been described in Proposition [\ref=propquasi] and it remains to show that this function uniquely solves the inversion.

First let us suppose Pg + 1 = P0. Then ([\ref=cleb2a]) becomes the usual Abel-Jacobi map and [formula] determines the divisor [formula] uniquely. In this case Z2 becomes a function of [formula]. Following [\cite=cg86], we express ([\ref=cleb2b]) as a sum of residues and obtain

[formula]

where we set

[formula]

Here

[formula]

and in the derivation of ([\ref=trans_Z]) we have used the single valuedness of h(P) and g(P) on c.

Now let us consider in ([\ref=cleb2a]), ([\ref=cleb2b]) the generic positive divisor [formula] where Pj  ≠  Q1,Q2. This situation can be reduced to the previous one by replacing ẑ by ẑ  -  A(Pj). Then the relation ([\ref=trans_Z]) gives rise to

[formula]

That is, if 2  =  K2, the function [formula] vanishes at [formula] with the same multiplicity. According to Proposition [\ref=propquasi], in our case f(P) has precisely g + 1 zeros, which therefore must coincide with [formula]. This proves Proposition [\ref=inv_clebsch].

It remains only to show that 2 coincides with K2 given by expression ([\ref=K2]). Let [formula], [formula] denote the value of h, respectively g on the cycles [formula] or [formula]. Then, if P lies on ak,

[formula]

while if P is on bk then

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

as the periodicity by shifts of a cycles means [formula]. Similarly we have that

[formula]

and therefore ([\ref=pre_K2]) yields the expression ([\ref=K2]) .[formula]

The General n case

We next inductively establish the general case of Theorem 2.2. We assume Theorem [\ref=genzeros] holds for n - 1 and consider

[formula]

where [formula]. We wish to show that the inversion of this map is given by zeros of the generalized theta function [formula] that comes from ([\ref=VarTheta]), ([\ref=pars]).

We again begin by supposing that Pg + n - 1 = P0. Then, using the inductive hypothesis, the solutions of the first n - 2 of equations ([\ref=cna]) are given in terms of [formula], and in this case Zn is a function of [formula], namely, the sum of residues,

[formula]

Noting that the functions [formula], [formula] are single valued on c and taking orientations into account, the latter expression may be rewritten as

[formula]

where we set

[formula]

According to item 2) of Proposition [\ref=propquasi], for generic [formula] the differential [formula] has a simple pole (of residue - 1) at [formula] and is regular at Q1,n while Ωn1 has simple poles at Q1,n. Upon an integration by parts we get

[formula]

Next, in view of the property ([\ref=cnresc]), the above relation yields which, in view of the recursive definition ([\ref=pars]), is equivalent to [formula].

Now consider in ([\ref=cna]) the generic positive divisor [formula] with [formula]. Then upon replacing [formula] by   -  A(Pj) (for any [formula]) we reduce to the case just considered and have that [formula]. On the other hand, in view of Proposition [\ref=propquasi], the function [formula] has precisely g + n - 1 zeros, which therefore coincide with [formula]. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=genzeros].

It remains to derive the expression ([\ref=defki]) for Ki. Our induction will have established this once we show that Kn has this form. Rewriting ([\ref=defk3]) we have that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are single valued on c. Again letting [formula] denote the value of h on the cycles [formula] or [formula] (and similarly for g) we have that if P lies on ak then

[formula]

while if bk then [formula], [formula]. Exactly paralleling the n = 2 calculation we have that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

as required.

Having the proof of Theorem [\ref=genzeros], we are able to prove Theorem [\ref=gendiv]. It assumes that [formula] does not vanish identically. Hence, f(P) has precisely g + n - 1 zeros [formula]. On the other hand, since [formula], we have that f(P0) = 0, and one of the above zeros, say Pg + n - 1, coincides with P0. Then, by Theorem [\ref=genzeros], there is the unique representation

[formula]

which is equivalent to ([\ref=theta0]).

Remark 2.

Both the theta divisor Θ and the set [formula] for which the function f(P) = θ(e  -  A(P)) vanishes identically are interesting and much studied objects [\cite=fk80]. Analogous to these we have the generalized (translated) theta divisor

[formula]

and the set [formula] for which [formula] does vanish identically. Again B  ⊂  Ξ, for if e does not belong to Ξ then f(P) cannot vanish identically. Although our inversion theorems have focused above on the subset [formula] for which [formula] does not vanish identically, both Ξ and B nonetheless appear interesting objects of study.
