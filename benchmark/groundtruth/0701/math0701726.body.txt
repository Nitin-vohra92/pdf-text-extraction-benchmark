The zeros of the derivative of the Riemann zeta function near the critical line

Corollary

Introduction

The Riemann hypothesis (RH) states that the real part of any nonreal zero of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) is 1 / 2. A. Speiser [\cite=Sp] has a theorem which says that RH is equivalent to the nonexistence of nonreal zeros of ζ'(s) in [formula].

We let ρ' = β' + iγ' denote a zero of ζ'(s) where a sum over ρ' is repeated according to multiplicity. N. Levinson and H. L. Montgomery [\cite=LM] proved that for nonreal zeros of ζ'(s) the average value of β' with [formula] is 1 / 2 +  log  log T /  log T. But it is likely that β' - 1 / 2 is usually of the order 1 /  log T rather than log  log T /  log T.

By a result of B. C. Berndt [\cite=Be], the number of zeros with ordinate less than T is

[formula]

Under RH, K. Soundararajan [\cite=So] demonstrated the presence of a positive proportion of zeros of ζ'(s) in the region σ < 1 / 2 + ν  /   log T for all [formula]. 'A positive proportion of zeros' means

[formula]

In his remarkable work, Y. Zhang [\cite=Zh] showed that not only unconditionally there exists a ν > 0 such that a positive proportion of zeros of ζ'(s) are in the region |σ - 1 / 2| < ν  /   log T, but also assuming RH and a strong hypothesis of the distribution of zeros of ζ(s), ν can be arbitrary small. Recently, Feng [\cite=Fe] proved the Zhang's second theorem only assuming the strong hypothesis. Thus it is very probable that

[formula]

Assuming the truth of RH, K. Soundararajan [\cite=So] conjectured that the following two statements are equivalent:

(i) lim inf (β' - 1 / 2) log γ' = 0;

(ii) lim inf (γ+  -  γ) log γ = 0 where γ+ is the least ordinate of a zero of ζ(s) with γ+  >  γ.

Y. Zhang [\cite=Zh] has shown that (ii) implies (i) as follows.

In this paper, we consider the converse of Theorem A. Namely is it true that (i) implies (ii)? Concerning this problem, we have the following.

Based on our theorems and Soundararajan's conjecture, we speculate as follows.

We briefly introduce why (2) in Theorem [\ref=t:main] doesn't seem possible. We let s = σ + it for real numbers, σ,t. It is known in [\cite=Da] and [\cite=Ti] that for [formula] and [formula] we have

[formula]

where the sum is over the ordinates of the complex zeros ρ  =  β + iγ of ζ(s). However, assuming RH, we may expect a stronger result. Under RH we have

[formula]

for [formula]. For this we refer to [\cite=Ti]. According to the formula (1.2), we can see that the formula (2) in Theorem 1 is very unrealistic, because '|σ - 1 / 2| < c /  log t' in (2) doesn't seem probable instead of '[formula]' in (1.2).

Concerning Corollary 1, it is worth noting that under RH

[formula]

holds uniformly for [formula], where [formula], c > 0 and 'O' depends upon c and σ1. For the proof of it, we apply the fact [\cite=Ti] to the formula

[formula]

Then we immediately get (1.3). In proving (1.3), one cannot relax the condition '1 / 2 + c /  log  log t' as

[formula]

With this information, it is very likely that on [formula] [formula],

[formula]

On the other hand, Corollary 1 follows from a Phragmén-Lindelöf argument, provided that we have

[formula]

on [formula] [formula]. Thus we find the behavior of the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta function near [formula] subtle and so we need a deep observation about the Riemann zeta function near the critical line to establish lim inf (β' - 1 / 2) log γ' = 0. In fact we will see from Theorem 4 in Section 2 that the behavior of ζ'(s) / ζ(s) on [formula] is very much related to

[formula]

where 1 / 2 + iγ,1 / 2 + iγ̃ are complex zeros of ζ(s) and the sum is over γ̃.

From Corollary 1, we can demonstrate the following.

Assuming RH, it is known in [\cite=Ti] and [\cite=Ti] that for any c > 0 and s = σ + it [formula], we have

[formula]

holds uniformly for [formula], and there exists an absolute constant c* > 0 depending on c such that

[formula]

holds for [formula];

[formula]

holds uniformly for [formula]. However, as in the proof of (1.3), one cannot relax the condition '1 / 2 + c /  log  log t' of (1.4) as 1 / 2 + c /  log t   (t  →    ∞  ). On the other hand, we have Ω-theorems related to log ζ(s) near the critical line. For these, we refer to Montgomery's results [\cite=Mo2] and [\cite=Ti]. In particular, Montgomery showed that assuming RH, for [formula] and any real θ, there is a t with [formula] such that

[formula]

See [\cite=Mo2]. Recently, from random matrix theory, in the case that θ = 0 in the above Ω-result, it is conjectured in [\cite=FGH] that we have the following:

[formula]

Concerning negative values of log |ζ(s)|, we observe that by (1.5) and (1.6), it is possible that we have

[formula]

for some arbitrarily large values of t, where ψ(t)  →    ∞   as t  →    ∞  . A sharp Ω-result like this implies lim inf (β' - 1 / 2) log γ' = 0. Namely, we note that it will follow if we show that (1.4) does not hold uniformly for [formula]. Thus, Corollary 2 is useful in investigating the horizontal behavior of zeros of the derivative of the Riemann zeta function.

We apply our theorem to mean values of the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta function:

[formula]

for σ = 1 / 2 + a /  log T.

We may get the following from a result of A. Selberg [\cite=Se].

We introduce more studies on mean values of the logarithmic derivative of ζ(s). Following Montgomery [\cite=Mo1], let

[formula]

where β + iγ and  + iγ̃ are zeros of ζ(s) and [formula]. Montgomery conjectured that for any fixed A > 1,

Under RH, D. A. Goldston, S. M. Gonek and H. L. Montgomery [\cite=Go] considered

[formula]

for σ = 1 / 2 + a /  log T as [formula] and proved the following, provided that (MH) is valid.

We have the following as in Theorem [\ref=t:ggm].

(MH) implies Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture. That is,

[formula]

Clearly (MH) implies

[formula]

Assuming RH, Theorem A says that

[formula]

Thus the assumptions of Theorem C and Theorem 2 are contradictory to each other. However, we have the similar conclusion in Theorem C and Theorem 2. Further, a theorem of D. A. Goldston, S. M. Gonek and H. L. Montgomery [\cite=Go] says the following.

Combining Theorem B and Theorem 2, we immediately have the following.

Apparently, Theorem D and Theorem 3 are similar. However the conclusion of Theorem D says a much stronger statement than that of Theorem 3. We notice that the pair correlation conjecture implies lim inf (β' - 1 / 2) log γ' = 0. Thus the conclusion of Theorem 3 under [formula] is instructive to understand the behavior of the mean value of the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta function.

Proof of Theorem 1 and Corollaries 1, 2

We arrange the zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) on the upper half-plane as [formula] with ρn  =  βn + iγn and

[formula]

where it appears precisely m times consecutively in the above sequence, if a zero is multiple with multiplicity m. RH is that βn = 1 / 2 for any [formula].

We state basic facts.

Let T > 0. Then, we have:

(1) The number of zeros of ζ(s) in [formula] is

[formula]

(2) The number of zeros of ζ(s) in [formula] is O( log T).

For Proposition 2.1(1), see [\cite=Da] and [\cite=Ti]. Proposition 2.1(2) immediately follows from (1).

We start with the following theorem.

We may assume that all but finitely many nontrivial zeros of ζ(s) are simple and on [formula], because we assume RH and lim inf (γn + 1  -  γn) log γn > 0.

(C) ⇒   (B). We recall that

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula].

Let δ > 0. Suppose that lim inf (γn + 1  -  γn) log γn  >  δ. Then we have

[formula]

for sufficiently large n.

We write

[formula]

By Proposition 2.1(2), the number of γn's between t and t + 1 is O( log t) for t > 1. Then, for some C > 0, we get

[formula]

By the assumption of Proposition 2.2, there exists a positive integer n1 such that

[formula]

Using this, for sufficiently large n, we have

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]. Here there exists a a > 0 such that [formula]. Thus we get

[formula]

We apply this inequality and (2.2) to (2.1) and then we obtain

[formula]

for sufficiently large n. This proves Proposition 2.2.

Choose c1 > 0 such that lim inf (γn + 1  -  γn) log γn > 2c1. Define Mn(t) by

[formula]

for [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

where the implied constant is absolute.

Since

[formula]

Mn(t) is decreasing. Thus it suffices to consider the endpoints for the proof. By Proposition 2.2 and our assumption (C), we have

[formula]

Similarly, we have

[formula]

Proposition 2.3 follows.

Using Proposition 2.1(2), Proposition 2.3 and (C), for ρn = 1 / 2 + iγn and s = σ + it [formula], we get

[formula]

in |σ - 1 / 2| < c /  log γn. By this and Proposition 2.2, (B) follows.

(B) ⇒   (A). We need the following proposition for this.

Assume RH and lim inf (γn + 1  -  γn) log γn > 0. Let [formula] be such that 0 <   <  δ where δ is as in Proposition 2.2. Suppose ζ'(β' + iγ') = 0 for sufficiently large γ'. If [formula] for all n, then we have

[formula]

We set

[formula]

for any [formula]. It is known that for some constants A and B,

[formula]

where ρ runs through all zeros of ξ(s). See [\cite=Da] and [\cite=Ti] for this. We note that any zero ρ of ξ(s) is either 1 / 2 + iγn or 1 / 2 - iγn for some n, provided that RH is true. By the product formula of ξ(s), we get

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

We assumed that for any n,

[formula]

By (2.3) we obtain that for s = β' + iγ', we get

[formula]

Applying the standard fact [\cite=Da]

[formula]

to (2.5), we obtain

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Thus, by this and (2.6), we obtain

[formula]

Using (2.4) and Proposition 2.2, we have

[formula]

We insert this to (2.7) and then we get

[formula]

This proves Proposition 2.4.

Suppose

[formula]

Then this and Proposition 2.4 implies that we have sequences 〈εk〉, 〈ρnk〉 and 〈ρk'〉 such that

[formula]

Using (B), we get

[formula]

Thus we obtain that for some c1 > 0,

[formula]

Note that c1 doesn't depend on εk's. By this and (2.8), we obtain

[formula]

But this is a contradiction, since [formula] and c1 > 0 is a fixed real number. Thus (A) follows.

(A) ⇒   (C). Suppose

[formula]

We write

[formula]

for [formula]. Let ε be an arbitrarily small positive real. As in the proof of (C) ⇒   (B), using Proposition 2.2, we obtain

[formula]

on [formula]. Then we can see that on |s - ρn| = ε  /   log γn we have

[formula]

for infinitely many n's. We note that

[formula]

has a zero at s = ρn. Thus Rouché's theorem implies that for some s' in |s - ρn| < ε  /   log γn,

[formula]

i.e., ζ'(s') = 0. Therefore lim inf (β' - 1 / 2) log γ' = 0. Hence (A) implies (C). We have completed the proof of Theorem 4.

Now we prove Theorem 1 and Corollaries 1, 2.

Assume that

[formula]

Then RH implies that lim inf (β' - 1 / 2) log γ' is positive. Then, by Theorem A, we obtain lim inf (γn + 1  -  γn) log γn > 0. Thus, by Theorem 4, we have (1) ⇒   (2).

Assume (2) is true. If there exist multiple zeros for ζ(s), we immediately get a contradiction from (2). Thus all zeros of ζ(s) are simple. Suppose that

[formula]

Then there exists a sequence of natural numbers 〈nk〉 with nk < nk + 1 such that

[formula]

as k  →    ∞  . Using (2), we have

[formula]

at s = 1 / 2 + i(γnk + 1  +  γnk) / 2. By this, we obtain

[formula]

or

[formula]

Namely, we have

[formula]

This is a contradiction, for lim k  →    ∞(γnk + 1  -  γnk) log γnk = 0. Hence, by Theorem 4, we have (2) ⇒   (1).

Thus Theorem 1 follows.

Assume (1). We fix c > 0. Then, by Theorem 4 (B), we have

[formula]

on σ = 1 / 2 + c /  log (|t| + 3). Using this, it is not hard to see that Corollary 1 follows from a Phragmén-Lindelöf argument. We give the detailed proof for convenience. For the following version of the Phragmén-Lindelöf Theorem, we refer to [\cite=Co].

Here [formula] if G is bounded, [formula] if G is unbounded and the limit superior of f(s) as s  →  a, is defined by

[formula]

where [formula]. If a =   ∞  , B(a,r) is the ball in the metric of [formula].

We apply this theorem for proving (1) ⇒   (3). We define sets G1 and G2 by

[formula]

We define G by

[formula]

We note that [formula]. We define f(s) by

[formula]

for s∈G. Then, f(s) is analytic on the region G. We choose [formula]. Clearly, the function [formula] is an analytic function which never vanishes and is bounded on G. By (2.9), there exists M > 0 such that we have

[formula]

on the boundary ∂G.

We have

[formula]

for s = σ + it∈G.

We may suppose σ < 2 and [formula]. Using Proposition 2.1(2), (1.1) and the fact that |σ - 1 / 2| > c /  log (|t| + 3) for s∈G, we get

[formula]

Thus, Claim follows.

Let η > 0. Then, by Claim, we conclude that in G, we have

[formula]

With this and (2.10), we see that the functions f and φ fulfill the conditions of Phragmén-Lindelöf Theorem. Hence [formula] for s∈G. Namely, we obtain

[formula]

for s∈G. In particular, we have

[formula]

uniformly for [formula] [formula]. From this, (1.3) and the fact that for [formula],

[formula]

we prove Corollary 1.

Using (1.4) and Corollary 1, we have

[formula]

for [formula]. Thus, we prove Corollary 2.

Proof of Theorem 2

We let T > 2 and σ = 1 / 2 + a /  log T for a small a. We set

[formula]

Theorem 4 implies that under the assumption of Theorem 2, we obtain that for s = σ + it and [formula],

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]. We write

[formula]

where an1 + 1  <  T < an1 + 2. Using (3.1), it is easy to see that

[formula]

We insert (3.1) into I and then we get

[formula]

Since lim inf (γn + 1  -  γn) log γn > 0, there is a β > 0 such that

[formula]

is large as [formula]. We recall Proposition 2.1(1)

[formula]

Using (3.3), (3.4) and the fact that [formula] as x  →    ∞  , we get

[formula]

We recall that there exists a A > 0 such that

[formula]

uniformly for [formula]. For this we refer to [\cite=Fu] and [\cite=Ti]. Using (3.4) and (3.6), we can see that

[formula]

We insert (3.5) and (3.7) into (3.2) and then we obtain

[formula]

Using I and II, we can get

[formula]

Hence Theorem 2 follows.
