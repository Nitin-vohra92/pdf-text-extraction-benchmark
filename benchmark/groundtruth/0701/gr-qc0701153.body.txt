N-dimensional Vaidya metric with cosmological constant in double-null coordinates

Introduction

The Vaidya metric[\cite=Kramer] is a solution of Einstein's equations for a spherically symmetric body with a unidirectional radial null-fluid. It has been used in the analysis of spherically symmetric collapse and the formation of naked singularities for many years (For references, see the extensive list of [\cite=Lake] and also [\cite=Joshi]). It is also known that Vaidya metric can be obtained from the Tolman metric by taking appropriate limits in the self-similar case[\cite=LemosHellaby]. This result has shed some light on the nature of the so-called shell-focusing singularities[\cite=EardleySmarr], as discussed in details in [\cite=Lake] [\cite=Kuroda1] [\cite=LakeZannias1] [\cite=LakeZannias2]. The Vaidya metric has also proved to be useful in the study of Hawking radiation and the process of black-hole evaporation[\cite=Hiscock] [\cite=Kuroda] [\cite=Biernacki] [\cite=Parentani], in the stochastic gravity program[\cite=Bei-Lok], and, more recently, in the quasinormal modes analysis of varying mass black holes[\cite=ACS] [\cite=ACS2].

The n-dimensional Vaidya metric is required in many physically relevant situations. The study of the gravitational collapse in higher dimensional spacetimes[\cite=GD], for instance, has contributed to the elucidation of the formation, nature and eventual visibility of singularities. This last topic belongs to the realm of the celebrated Penrose's Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, see, e.g., [\cite=Joshi] for references. Higher dimensional varying mass black holes are also central protagonists in the new phenomenological models with extra dimensions[\cite=Arkani]. These objects might be obtained in the LHC at CERN[\cite=LHC] and, once produced, they are expected to decay driven by the emission of Hawing radiation. The analysis of their quasinormal modes can help the understanding of the dynamics of the evaporation process, and could even lead to some observational signs[\cite=ACS2].

The inclusion of a cosmological constant Λ in the n-dimensional Vaidya metric is mainly motivated by the recent intensive activities in the AdS/CFT and dS/CFT conjectures, see [\cite=conj] for some references. A cosmological constant is also necessary to allow the discussion of the n = 3 case in the same framework of the higher dimensional cases.

The n-dimensional Vaidya metric was first discussed in [\cite=IV]. It can be easily cast in n-dimensional (n > 3, the three dimensional case will be discussed latter) radiation coordinates [formula][\cite=GD]:

[formula]

where c =   ±  1 and dΩ2n - 2 stands for the metric of the unity (n - 2)-dimensional sphere, assumed here to be spanned by the angular coordinates [formula],

[formula]

For the case of an ingoing radial flow, c = 1 and m(v) is a monotone increasing mass function in the advanced time v, while c =  - 1 corresponds to an outgoing radial flow, with m(v) being in this case a monotone decreasing mass function in the retarded time v. The 4-dimensional Vaidya metric with a cosmological constant in the radiation coordinates has been considered previously in [\cite=PR].

It is well known that the radiation coordinates are defective at the horizon[\cite=LSM], implying that the Vaidya metric ([\ref=Vaidya]) is not geodesically complete in any dimension. (See [\cite=Fayos] for a discussion about possible analytical extensions). Besides, the cross term drdv can introduce unnecessary oddities in the hyperbolic equations governing the evolution of physical fields on spacetimes with the metric ([\ref=Vaidya]). Typically, the double-null coordinates are far more convenient. This was the main motivation of Waugh and Lake's work[\cite=WL], where the problem of casting the 4-dimensional Vaidya metric with Λ = 0 in double-null coordinates is considered. As all previous attempts to construct a general transformation from radiation to double-null coordinates have failed, they followed Synge[\cite=Synge] and considered Einstein's equation with spherical symmetry in double-null coordinates ab initio. The resulting equations, however, have revealed to be not analytical solvable for generic mass functions. Waugh and Lake's work was recently revisited in [\cite=GS], where a semi-analytical approach allowing for generic mass functions was proposed. Such approach consists in a qualitative study of the null-geodesics, allowing the description of light-cones and revealing many features of the underlying causal structure. It can be used also for more quantitative analyses, indeed, it has already enhanced considerably the accuracy of the quasinormal modes analysis of 4-dimensional varying mass black holes [\cite=ACS] [\cite=ACS2], and it can be also applied to the study of gravitational collapse[\cite=GS]. We notice that another method to construct conformal diagrams based on a systematic study of the null-geodesics was also recently proposed in [\cite=meth].

Here, we extend the approach proposed in [\cite=GS] to the n-dimensional (n > 2) case and to allow the inclusion of a cosmological constant Λ. Some new exact solutions are also presented. For n = 3, notably, a crucial non-linearity can be circumvented and the problem can be reduced to the solution of a second order linear ordinary differential equation, opening the possibility for analytical study of large classes of mass functions. We generalize one of Waugh and Lake's exact solutions by introducing the case corresponding to [formula], n > 3, describing a naked or shell focusing singularity in a n-dimensional spacetime. We present also some explicit examples of the use of the semi-analytical approach to the study of the causal structure of some particular solutions.

In the next Section, the main equations are derived and the exact solutions are presented. Section [\ref=sec3] is devoted to the introduction of the semi-analytical approach. Some explicit examples are presented, particularly the two apparent horizons case of an evaporating black hole in a de Sitter spacetime and the BTZ black hole undergoing a finite time interval mass accretion process. The last Section is left to some concluding remarks. This work has two further appendices. The first one presents explicitly the n-dimensional geometrical quantities necessary to reproduce the equations of the Section [\ref=sec2], and the last contains the polynomial manipulations involved in the calculations of the apparent horizons of Sections [\ref=sec2] and [\ref=sec3].

The metric

The n-dimensional spherically symmetric line element in double-null coordinates [formula] is given by

[formula]

where f(u,v) and r(u,v) are non vanishing smooth functions. We adopt here the same conventions of [\cite=WL] and [\cite=GS]. In particular, the indices [formula] and [formula] stand for the differentiation with respect to u and v, respectively.

The energy-momentum tensor of a unidirectional radial null-fluid in the eikonal approximation is given by

[formula]

where ka is a radial null vector. We will consider here, without loss of generality, the case of a flow along the v-direction. The case of simultaneous ingoing and outgoing flows in 4 dimensions was already been considered in [\cite=Let]. Einstein's equations are less constrained in such case, allowing the construction of some exact similarity solutions, which, incidentally, can also be generalized to the n-dimensional case in the light of the present work.

Einstein's equations with cosmological constant Λ

[formula]

implies that, for the for the energy-momentum tensor ([\ref=T]),

[formula]

Using ([\ref=ricci]) and ([\ref=contr]), Einstein's equations for the metric ([\ref=uv]) and the energy-momentum tensor ([\ref=T]) read

[formula]

For n  ≠  3, differentiating Eq. ([\ref=eq4]) with respect to u and then inserting Eq. ([\ref=eq1]) leads to

[formula]

where A(v) is an arbitrary integration function. The n = 3 case will be considered below. Now, differentiating Eq. ([\ref=eq4]) with respect to v and using ([\ref=eq2]) and ([\ref=A]) gives

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=eq1]) is ready to be integrated

[formula]

where B(v) is another arbitrary integration (and nonvanishing) function. From ([\ref=hh]) and ([\ref=B]), one has

[formula]

Finally, by using ([\ref=eq4]) and ([\ref=B]), Eq. ([\ref=A]) can be written as

[formula]

Note that ([\ref=eq3]) follows from Eqs. ([\ref=B]) and ([\ref=r2]). Einstein's equations are, therefore, equivalent to the equations ([\ref=B]), ([\ref=h]), and ([\ref=r2]), generalizing the results of [\cite=WL] and [\cite=GS].

In order to interpret physically the arbitrary integration functions A(v) and B(v), let us transform from the double-null coordinates back to the radiation coordinates by means of the coordinate change (u,v)  →  (r(u,v),v). Such a transformation casts ([\ref=uv]) in the form

[formula]

where ([\ref=B]) was explicitly used. Comparing ([\ref=Vaidya]) and ([\ref=uv1]) and taking into account ([\ref=r2]), it is clear that with the choice

[formula]

for A2  ≠  0, the function A(v) should represent the mass of the n-dimensional solution, suggesting the following n-dimensional generalization of the mass definition based in the angular components of the Riemann tensor proposed for for Λ = 0 in [\cite=mass]:

[formula]

k > 1, see ([\ref=m]) and ([\ref=r2]). Note that for constant A, the choice of the function B(v) is irrelevant since it can be absorbed by a redefinition of v. Note also that the weak energy condition applied for ([\ref=T]) requires, from ([\ref=h]), that BA2  ≤  0. Since B must be nonvanishing from ([\ref=B]), A(v) must be a monotone function.

The Kretschmann scalar K = RabcdRabcd could be also invoked to interpret the integration function A. Taking into account Eqs. ([\ref=B]) and ([\ref=r2]), we have from ([\ref=K])

[formula]

It is clear from ([\ref=KN]) that r = 0 is a singularity for A  ≠  0 and that A acts as a gravitational source placed at r = 0.

The problem now may be stated in the same way of the 4-dimensional Λ = 0 case[\cite=GS]: given the mass function A(v) and the constant B, one needs to solve Eq. ([\ref=r2]), giving rise to the function r(u,v). Then, f(u,v) and h(u,v) are calculated from ([\ref=B]) and ([\ref=h]). The arbitrary function of u appearing in the integration of ([\ref=r2]) must be chosen properly[\cite=WL] in order to have a non-vanishing f(u,v) function from ([\ref=B]). Unfortunately, as stressed early by Waugh and Lake[\cite=WL], such a procedure is not analytically solvable in general. They, nevertheless, were able to find some regular solutions for Eqs. ([\ref=B])-([\ref=r2]) for n = 4 and Λ = 0, namely the linear (A(v) = λcv) and a certain exponential ([formula]) mass functions (λ,α, and β are positive constants, c =   ±  1, corresponding to ingoing/outgoing flow, respectively). The 4-dimensional linear mass case was also considered in [\cite=LakeZannias2] in great detail and in a more general situation (the case of a charged radial null fluid). In [\cite=GS], another 4-dimensional exact solution corresponding to A(v)  =  κ / v and Λ = 0 was also presented and discussed. These are the only varying mass analytical solutions obtained in double-null coordinates so far. We notice, however, that Kuroda was able to construct a transformation from radiation to double-null coordinates for some other particular mass functions in four dimensions[\cite=Kuroda].

In the following Section, we will present a semi-analytical procedure to attack the problem of solving Eqs. ([\ref=B])-([\ref=r2]) for general mass functions obeying the weak energy condition, generalizing in this way the results of [\cite=GS] obtained for n = 4 and Λ = 0. The approach allows us to construct qualitatively conformal diagrams, identifying horizons and singularities, and also to evaluate specific geometric quantities. Before, however, we notice that the Waugh and Lake's linear 4-dimensional solution can be also generalized for n-dimensions. Let us consider the mass function

[formula]

v  ≥  0, λ  >  0. For this mass function and Λ = 0, with the choice ([\ref=cC]), Eq. ([\ref=r2]) reads

[formula]

which can be integrated as

[formula]

where D(u) is an arbitrary integration function, implying, from Eq. ([\ref=B]), that

[formula]

The integration function D must be chosen in order to have a regular f. As in the 4-dimensional case originally considered by Waugh and Lake, we have three qualitatively distinct cases: 0 < λ  <  λcn, λ  =  λcn, and λ  >  λcn, where

[formula]

For λ  >  λcn, for instance, the quantity inside the square brackets in ([\ref=ff]) does not vanish, see Appendix [\ref=hor]. The integral in ([\ref=ada]) can be (numerically) evaluated and, for instance with the Waugh and Lake's choice D(u)  =   - u, r(u,v) can be also (numerically) determined. The resulting causal structures are the same ones as the Waugh and Lake's 4-dimensional cases. We will construct the relevant conformal diagrams for the three qualitatively distinct cases as an application of the semi-analytical approach.

The three dimensional case

In lower dimensional (n < 4) spacetimes, the Riemann tensor is completely determined by its traces, namely the Ricci tensor and the scalar curvature, implying some qualitative distinct behavior for the solutions of Einstein's equations in these situations[\cite=lower]. For n = 3, Eq. ([\ref=eq4]) reads

[formula]

It is interesting to compare this last equation with ([\ref=A]). Eq. ([\ref=B]) is still valid and by using it, Eq. ([\ref=eq4-3]) can be easily integrated,

[formula]

where C is an arbitrary integration function which we call, by convenience, C(v)  =   - B(v)A(v), leading to

[formula]

which corresponds to the 3-dimensional counterpart of Eq. ([\ref=r2]). Eq. ([\ref=eq3]) for n = 3 also follows from ([\ref=B]) and ([\ref=r2-3]). As for the n-dimensional case, by using ([\ref=B]) and ([\ref=r2-3]), one gets from ([\ref=eq2]) the last equation

[formula]

One can show that the integration functions A and B have the same physical interpretation as the higher dimensional cases by introducing the radiation coordinates. We have for the 3-dimensional case

[formula]

It is clear that with the choice ([\ref=cC]) for B, the function A plays the role of the BTZ black-hole mass[\cite=BTZ] (Λ < 0 in this case). Note, however, that for n = 3 there is no purely angular components of the Riemann tensor and, therefore, there is no equivalent of the mass definition ([\ref=massd]). The Kretschmann scalar in this case reads simply

[formula]

In fact, if terms involving distributions are take into account properly, curvature invariants as K reveal that the origin for the BTZ black hole is a conical singularity (See, for a recent rigorous analysis, [\cite=distr]).

In contrast with the n-dimensional case, the non-linearity present in ([\ref=r2-3]) can be easily circumvented. Let us consider A2 > 0, B =  - 1 / 2, and [formula] (Other cases follow straightforwardly). By introducing the linear second order ordinary differential equation

[formula]

it is easy to show that

[formula]

is solution of ([\ref=r2-3]), where wa(v) and wb(v) are the two linearly independent solutions of ([\ref=ode]), and P(u) is an arbitrary function. The second order linear equation ([\ref=ode]) has analytical solution in closed form for many functions A(v). For instance, for [formula] (or [formula]), [formula], Eq. ([\ref=ode]) is equivalent to the Bessel equation, after an appropriate redefinition of v (v  →  v(α / 2 + 1) or v  →  eαv / 2). Even for the case where no solution in closed form can be obtained, the main analytical properties of w(v) can be inferred easily from ([\ref=ode]) due to its linearity.

Semi-analytical approach

We review here the semi-analytical approach proposed in [\cite=GS] for the solution of the equation ([\ref=r2]) (or, analogously, ([\ref=r2-3]) for the 3-dimensional case). Firstly, notice that in double-null coordinates the light-cones correspond to the hypersurfaces with constant u or constant v. One can, in this case, deduce the causal structure of a given spacetime by considering the set of null geodesics corresponding to u =  constant or v =  constant. The function r(u,v), obtained as the solution of ([\ref=r2]) with a careful choice of initial conditions[\cite=WL] [\cite=GS], has also a clear geometrical interpretation: it is the radius of the (n - 2) dimensional sphere defined by the intersection between the hypersurfaces u =  constant and v =  constant. Once r(u,v) is obtained from ([\ref=r2]), f(u,v) and h(u,v) can be calculated directly from Eqs. ([\ref=B]) and ([\ref=h]), giving all the information about the spacetime in question. Incidentally, Eqs. ([\ref=r2]) along constant u, and, consequently, along a portion of the light-cone, is a first order ordinary differential equation in v. One can evaluate the function r(u,v) in any spacetime point by solving the v-initial value problem knowing r(u,0). For instance, the usual constant curvature empty spacetimes (A = 0) can be obtained by choosing r(u,0) = u / 2, leading to

[formula]

As it is expected, for the n-dimensional de Sitter case (Λ  >  0), [formula] corresponds to a cosmological horizon. The condition r1(u,0)  ≠  0 is sufficient to assure that f(u,v)  ≠  0 everywhere[\cite=GS].

Let us focus now on the solutions r(v)  =  r(ū,v) of ([\ref=r2]), considered as a a first order ordinary differential equation in v for constant u = ū, keeping in mind that they indeed describe how r(ū,v) varies along the u = ū portion of the light-cone and, thus, that they are closely related to the causal structure of the underlying spacetime. This situation is shown schematically in Fig. [\ref=schem].

For n > 3, the curves defined by

[formula]

correspond (if they indeed exist) to the frontiers of certain regions of the (v,r) plane where the solutions r(v) of ([\ref=r2]) have qualitative distinct behaviors. For the de Sitter case, ([\ref=ahor]) can define two non intersecting curves, whereas for the anti de Sitter case (Λ  <  0) there is only one curve. (See Appendix [\ref=hor]). Let us suppose, for instance, a de Sitter case with A2(v) > 0 (and B =  - 1 / 2. Outgoing radiation flows, 3-dimensional spacetimes, or the anti de Sitter case follow in a straightforward manner). Let us call rEH(v) and rCH(v) the curves defined by ([\ref=ahor]), see Fig. [\ref=figure1]. Due to ([\ref=r2]), for all points of the plane (v,r) below rEH(v), r2  <  0. Hence, any solution r(v) entering in this region will, unavoidably, reach the singularity at r = 0, with finite v. Suppose a given solution ri(v) with initial condition ri(0) = ri enters into the region below rEH(v). As, for smooth A, the uniqueness of solutions for ([\ref=r2]) is guaranteed for any point with r > 0, any solution starting at r(0) < ri is confined the the region below ri(v) and will also reach the singularity at r = 0, with finite v. On the other hand, suppose that a given solution re(v) with initial condition re(0) = re never enters into the region bellow the curve rEH(v). Solution starting at r(0) > re are, therefore, confined to the region above re(v) and will escape from the singularity at r = 0. Hence, one has two qualitatively distinct behavior for the light-cones, see Fig. [\ref=figure1]. For r(0) < ri, the future direction points toward the singularity and all null geodesics eventually reach r = 0. This is the typical situation in the interior region of a black-hole. For r(0) > re, the u =  constant portion of the light cones escape from the singularity. The curve rEH(v) plays the role of an apparent event horizon. For a given v, all solutions r(v) in Fig. [\ref=figure1] such that r(v)  ≤  rEH(v) will be captured by the singularity. Solutions for which r(v) > rEH(v) are temporally free, but they may find themselves trapped later if rEH(v) increases. The event horizon corresponds to the last of these solutions trapped by the singularity and is located somewhere between ri(v) and re(v).

In the region between rEH(v) and rCH(v), the solutions r(v) have r2  >  0. They escape from rEH(v) and tend asymptotically to rCH(v), which plays the role of an apparent cosmological horizon. The region above rCH(v) corresponds to the cosmological exterior (See, for instance, [\cite=Carter]. For A = 0, the cosmological exterior region corresponds to the choice r0  =    ∞   in ([\ref=dS])). There, r2 < 0 and the solutions also tend asymptotically to rCH(v). The case where rEH(v) and rCH(v) converge to the same function gives rise to the interesting n-dimensional Nariai solution[\cite=CDL].

Summarizing, since the partial differential equation ([\ref=r2]) for r(u,v) does not involve u explicitly, it is always possible to discover how the light-cones cross the (n - 2)-dimensional spheres of radius r by exploring, in the plane (v,r), the solutions r(ū,v) of the first order differential equation corresponding to ([\ref=r2]) considered on the constant u null-geodesics. From these informations, one can reconstruct the causal structure of the underlying spacetime. For typical cases, we will have some spacetime regions where the light cones necessarily end in the singularity at r = 0, whereas for some other regions it is always possible to escape to the null infinity. The frontier of these regions must correspond to event horizons. Let us illustrate the approach with some explicit examples.

Waugh and Lake generalized solutions

As the first application of the semi-analytical approach, let us consider the generalized Waugh and Lake solutions corresponding to the choice ([\ref=massg]) for the mass function, n > 3 , and Λ = 0. From the discussion of Section [\ref=sec2], we expect three qualitatively distinct case according to the value of λ. In fact, these solutions have the same causal structure for any n > 3. The frontier of the region in the (v,r) plane where all the solutions of ([\ref=eq21]) reach the singularity at r = 0 corresponds to the straight line

[formula]

Taking the v-derivative of ([\ref=eq21]), one gets

[formula]

The regions in the plane (v,r) where the solutions obeys r22 = 0 are the straight lines defined by

[formula]

One can now repeat the analysis done for the n = 4 case by considering the three qualitative different cases according to the value of λ and the possible solutions of ([\ref=rr]). For this purpose, we will consider the solutions of ([\ref=eq21]) with the initial condition [formula].

For λ  >  λcn, with λcn given by ([\ref=lambdac]), Eq. ([\ref=rr]) has no solution and r22 < 0 for all points with v > 0. The only relevant frontier in the plane (v,r) is the r0(v) straight line. All solutions of ([\ref=eq21]) are concave functions and cross the r2 = 0 line, reaching the singularity with a finite v which increases monotonically with u. The causal structure of the corresponding spacetime is very simple. There is no horizon, and all future cones end in the singularity at r = 0. The associated conformal diagram is depicted in Fig. [\ref=figure2].

For λ  =  λcn, r22 = 0 only on the line

[formula]

This straight line itself is a solution of ([\ref=eq21]). All other solutions are concave functions. Note that, in this case, rh(v)  >  r0(v) for v > 0. We have two distinct qualitative behavior for the null trajectories along u constant. All solutions starting at r(0) > 0 are confined to the region above rh(v). They never reach the singularity, all trajectories reach I+. However, in the region below rh(v), we have infinitely many concave trajectories starting and ending in the (shell-focusing) singularity. They start at r(0) = 0, increase in the region between rh(v) and r0(v), cross the last line and reach unavoidably r = 0 again, with finite v. The trajectory rh(v) plays the role of an event horizon, separating two regions with distinct qualitative behavior: one where constant u null trajectories reach I+ and another where they start and end in the singularity. This behavior is only possible, of course, because the solutions of ([\ref=eq21]) fail to be unique at r = 0. The relevant conformal diagram is also shown in Fig. [\ref=figure2].

For 0 < λ  <  λcn, we have three distinct regions according to the concavity of the solutions. They are limited by the two straight lines r-(v) and r+(v) defined by ([\ref=rr]). We have r0(v)  <  r-(v)  <  r+(v) for v > 0. Both straight lines r-(v) and r+(v) are also solutions of ([\ref=eq21]). Between them, solutions are convex. Above r+ and below r-, solutions are concave. The last line is the inner horizon. Inside, the null trajectories with constant u start and end in the singularity r = 0. The line r+ is an outer horizon. Between them, the constant u null trajectories starts in the naked singularity and reach I+. Beyond the outer horizon, all constant u null trajectories escape the singularity, see Fig. ([\ref=figure2]).

Black-hole evaporation in a de Sitter spacetime

As an example of using the semi-analytical approach for Λ  ≠  0, let us consider the case of a evaporating black hole due to Hawking radiation in a de Sitter n-dimensional (n > 3) spacetime. The mass decreasing rate for these n-dimensional black holes can be obtained from the n-dimensional Stefan-Boltzmann law (see, for instance, [\cite=CDM]), leading to

[formula]

where a > 0 is the effective n-dimensional Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Eq. ([\ref=dMdt]) can be immediately integrated, leading to

[formula]

where u0 in the lifetime of a black hole with initial mass m0,

[formula]

We recall that ([\ref=dMdt]) is not expected to be valid in the very final stages of the black hole evaporation, where the appearance of new emission channels for Hawking radiation[\cite=final] can induce changes in the value of the constant a, and maybe even the usual adiabatic derivation of Hawking radiations is not valid any longer. We do not address these points here. We assume that the black hole evaporates completely ([\ref=meva]) for all 0  ≤  u  ≤  u0 and that m = 0 for u > u0. Notice that, since m'  →    ∞   for u  →  u0, a naked singularity will be formed after the vanishing of the black hole[\cite=Kuroda].

We can consider now a n-dimensional Vaidya metric with a mass term of the form given by ([\ref=meva]). This is the first case of an outgoing radial flux we consider, and according to ([\ref=cC]), B = 1 / 2. However, in this case, f(u,v) has different sign and the temporal directions for the B =  - 1 / 2 case are now spacelike. The transformation (u,v)  →  (v, - u) restores the temporal and spatial directions[\cite=GS]. One needs to keep in mind that, for B < 0 (ingoing radiation fields), v corresponds to the advanced time, whereas for B > 0 (outgoing radiation fields), u should correspond to the retarded time. In this case, the equivalent of Eq. ([\ref=r2]) for the mass function ([\ref=meva]) reads

[formula]

0  ≤  u  ≤  0. For u > u0, we have a empty n-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. We can now apply the same procedure we have used for the previous cases. We call rEH(u) and rCH(u) the curves on the (u,r) plane delimiting the regions where the solutions of ([\ref=eqq]) have qualitative distinct behavior. (See Fig. [\ref=fig4]). In this case, since A1 < 0, the curve rEH(v) decreases and reach r = 0 for u = u0, corresponding to the total vanishing of the black hole. After this point, rCH(v) is the only horizon (a cosmological one) of this spacetime. Before u = u0, however, some solutions of ([\ref=eqq]) that crossed rEH(v) could reach the singularity at r = 0. The exterior cosmological region (region of the (u,r) plane above rCH(v)) is insensitive to the singularity. The resulting conformal diagram shown in Fig. [\ref=fig4]. It represents a spacetime with a cosmological horizon and, in its interior, a black hole that evaporates completely leaving behind a naked singularity.

Mass accretion by BTZ black-holes

As an explicit example of the n = 3 case, let us consider a BTZ black hole[\cite=BTZ] undergoing a mass accretion process during a finite time interval. The C1-class mass function

[formula]

does correspond to such a situation. Here, mi and mf stand for, respectively, the initial and final mass, and the constants a  =  (mf - mi) / 4v30 and b  =  (mf + mi) / 2 are chosen in order to have smooth matches at v =   ±  v0. For the BTZ case, [formula] and the apparent horizon corresponding to the region of the (r,v) plane where r2 = 0 is given simply by [formula], see ([\ref=r2-3]). Since A2 > 0, we adopt B =  - 1 / 2. The solutions of ([\ref=r2-3]) below the curve rEH(v) have r2 < 0, whereas those ones above have r2 > 0, see Fig. [\ref=btz]. For v <  - v0, and analogously for v > v0, Eq. ([\ref=r2-3]) can be easily integrated

[formula]

where Di(u) is a monotone arbitrary integration function. The region [formula], is obtained by choosing Di(u) > 0, whereas [formula] corresponds to Di(u) < 0. In the interior region of a BTZ black hole, we see from ([\ref=ww]) that the constant u null-geodesics reach the conical singularity at r = 0 in a finite time given by [formula]. In contrast with the n > 3 cases, the solutions r(v) here do not reach r = 0 perpendicularly (See Fig. [\ref=btz]). For the exterior region, the null-geodesics can reach the spatial infinity r =   ∞   also in a finite time given by [formula].

The solutions r(v) for the mass function ([\ref=ac3]) are obtained by matching, at v =   ±  v0, the BTZ black hole ([\ref=ww]) with the accretion process corresponding to - v0 < v  <  v0. This situation is depicted in the Fig. [\ref=btz].

Conclusion

We considered here the problem of constructing the n-dimensional Vaidya metric with a cosmological constant Λ in double-null coordinates, generalizing the work [\cite=GS], where a semi-analytical approach is proposed to attack the equations derived previously by Waugh and Lake[\cite=WL] for n = 4 and Λ = 0. Some new exact solutions are also presented. For n = 3, in particular, the problem reduces to the solution of the second order linear ordinary differential equation ([\ref=ode]), allowing the analytical study of large classes of mass functions A(v). As an example, for Λ < 0 and A(v) = m0 + m1 tanh v, m0 > m1, Eq. ([\ref=ode]) is equivalent to the hypergeometric equation, after a proper redefinition of v. This situation corresponds to a BTZ black hole with mass m0 - m1 that accretes some mass smoothly and ends with mass m0 + m1. This kind of smooth exact solution, with two "asymptotic BTZ" regions (v  →    ±    ∞  ) is very interesting to the study of creation of particles in non stationary spacetimes[\cite=Asympt].

The generalized semi-analytical approach is also useful to the study of quasinormal modes of varying mass n-dimensional black holes. In particular, an interesting point is the study of the stationary regime for quasinormal modes, described in [\cite=ACS], in higher dimensional space and in the presence of a cosmological constant. The semi-analytical approach can help the understanding of the relation anticipated by Konoplya[\cite=Konoplya] for the quasinormal modes of n-dimensional black holes with Λ = 0: [formula], where ωR and r0 stand for the oscillation frequency and the black hole radius, respectively. Some preliminary results[\cite=ACS2] suggests the existence of a stationary regime such that, for slowly varying mass n-dimensional black holes, [formula]. As another application for Λ  ≠  0, we have the dynamical formation of a Nariai solution, which could be accomplished by choosing A(v) such that rEH(v)  →  rCH(v) for larges v. These points are still under investigation.

Some geometrical quantities

We present here some geometrical quantities necessary to reproduce the equations of Section II. Such quantities are the n-dimensional (n > 2) generalization of those ones calculated previously by Synge[\cite=Synge] and Waugh and Lake[\cite=WL] for n = 4. Only nonvanishing terms are given.

Recall that our n-dimensional line element is given by

[formula]

where dΩ2n - 2 is the unity (n - 2) sphere, assumed here to be spanned by the angular coordinates [formula],

[formula]

The Christoffel symbols are

[formula]

The totally covariant Riemann tensor Rabcd is given by

[formula]

Using ([\ref=B]), we get from the purely angular components of the Riemann tensor:

[formula]

for any k > 1. As for the n = 4 case[\cite=mass], such components are invariant under transformations involving solely the double-null coordinates (u,v)  →  (U(u,v),V(u,v)) and are candidates for defining the mass of the solution for Λ = 0.

The Ricci tensor, obtained by the contraction [formula] is given by

[formula]

Two scalar quantities are relevant for our purposes: the scalar curvature R = gabRab and the Kretschmann scalar K = RabcdRabcd. They are given by

[formula]

and

Some polynomial results

The evaluation of the zeros of f given by ([\ref=ff]) involves finding the positive roots of the polynomial

[formula]

for λ  >  0 and n > 3. The only roots of pn(x) are x = 1 / 2 and x = 0, the latter with multiplicity n - 3. For positive x, pn(x) < 0 only in the interval x∈(0,1 / 2). The minimal value of pn(x) in such an interval corresponds to

[formula]

where

[formula]

the unique root of p'n(x) in the interval. Thus, for λ  >  λcn, the polynomial ([\ref=p1]) has no roots. For λ  =  λcn there is only one root (x = xp max), while for 0 < λ  <  λcn, there are two roots x1 and x2, with 0 < x1 < xp max < x2  <  1 / 2.

The determination of the curves ([\ref=ahor]) involves the evaluation of the positive roots of the polynomial

[formula]

with A > 0 and n > 3. For the anti de Sitter case, Λ < 0, the only root of qn(x) is x = 0, qn(x) and q'n(x) are both positive for all x  >  0, and, therefore, ([\ref=q1]) has only one positive root. Equation ([\ref=ahor]), in this case, defines only one curve.

On the other hand, for the de Sitter case, Λ > 0, qn(x) has always 3 roots: [formula] and x = 0, the last with multiplicity n - 3. Moreover, for positive x, qn(x)  ≥  0 only for x∈[null], and the maximum value of qn(x) in such an interval is qn(xq max), where

[formula]

the only point of the interval where q'n(x) = 0. For 0  <  2A / (n - 3)  <  qn(xq max), ([\ref=q1]) has always two roots x1 and x2, x1  <  xq max  <  x2. For 2A / (n - 3)  =  qn(xq max), there is only one root x = xq max, and for 2A / (n - 3)  >  pn(xq max) there is no root at all. In this case, provided that 0  <  2A / (n - 3)  <  qn(xq max), Eq. ([\ref=ahor]) defines two curves rEH(v) and rCH(v) (See Fig. [\ref=figure1]), such that rEH(v)  <  xq max  <  rCH(v).

If r(v) is a curve defined by ([\ref=ahor]), its derivative is given by

[formula]

If Λ  <  0, it is clear that r'(v) has the same sign of A'(v). For Λ  >  0, the curves rEH(v) and rCH(v) have qualitatively distinct behavior. Since rEH(v) < xq max, r'EH(v) has the same sign of A'(v). The curve rCH(v) has the converse behavior, since rCH(v) > xq max.
