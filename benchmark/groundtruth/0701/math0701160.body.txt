A simple reformulation of Riemann's Zeta function

Introduction

The connection between Riemann's zeta function [formula] [\cite=riemann59:_ueber_anzah_primz_groes] and Euler's product formula [\cite=euler48:_introd_analy_infin] has long been known. In this paper we introduce an intermediate representation for ζ(s) as a sum of products over the primes.

Results

Let {pk} be the sequence of the primes,

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Explicitly

[formula]

For any [formula] and [formula], we have Zi(s)  =  1  +  Si(s).

Proof: We proceed by induction.

Base case: For i = 1 we have

[formula]

[formula]

Induction hypothesis: Assume

[formula]

By adding and subtracting p- si + 1 to the r.h.s. we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

For [formula], Riemann's Zeta function can be written as

[formula]

where [formula].

Proof: The result follows directly from noting that Euler's product formula can be expressed as

[formula]

and from the previous theorem. [formula]

Conclusions

In our reformulation for the Riemann's Zeta function, ζ(s) is expressed as a sum over the primes, where each term is a product with factors depending only on the summation index (a prime) and the primes following it. The formulation is interesting because of its similarity with the original definition of the Zeta function, [formula], the factors ak(s) effectively being corrections that account for all the (non-prime) naturals whose prime factor decomposition starts with pk.
