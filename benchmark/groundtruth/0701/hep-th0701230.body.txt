N=1 Supersymetric Quantum Mechanics in a Scenario with Lorentz-Symmetry Violation

Lorentz and CPT invariances are cornerstones in modern Quantum Field Theory, both symmetries being respected by the Standard Model for Particle Physics. Nevertheless, nowadays one faces the possibility that this scenario is only an effective theoretical description of a low-energy regime, an assumption that leads to the idea that these fundamental symmetries could be violated when one deals with energies close to the Planck scale. Since the pioneering work by Carroll-Field-Jackiw [\cite=Jackiw], Lorentz-violating theories have been extensively studied and used as an effective probe to test the limits of Lorentz covariance. Nowadays, these theories are encompassed in the framework of the Extended Standard Model (SME), conceived by Colladay and Kostelecky [\cite=Colladay] as a possible extension of the minimal Standard Model of the fundamental interactions. The SME admits Lorentz and CPT violation in all sectors of interactions by incorporating tensor terms (generated possibly as vacuum expectation values of a more fundamental theory) that account for such a breaking. Actually, the SME model sets out as an effective model that keeps unaffected the SU(3)  ×  SU(2)  ×  U(1) gauge structure of the underlying fundamental theory while it breaks Lorentz symmetry at the particle frame.

The gauge sector of the SME has been studied with focus on many different aspects [\cite=Colladay]-[\cite=Belich]. The fermion sector has been investigated as well, initially by considering general features (dispersion relations, plane-wave solutions, and energy eigenvalues) [\cite=Colladay], and later by scrutinizing CTP-violating probing experiments conceived to find out in which extent the Lorentz violation may turn out manifest and to set up upper bounds on the breaking parameters. The CPT theorem, valid for any local Quantum Field Theory, predicts the equality of some quantities (life-time, mass, gyromagnetic ratio, charge-to-mass ratio) for a particle and its corresponding anti-particle. Thus, in the context of Quantum Electrodynamics, the most precise and sensitive tests of Lorentz and CPT invariance refer to comparative measurements of these quantities. For the sake of illustration, a well-known example of this kind of test involves high-precision measurement of the gyromagnetic ratio [\cite=Gyro] and cyclotron frequencies [\cite=Cyclotron] for electron and positron confined in a Penning trap for a long time. The unsuitability of the usual figure of merit adopted in these works, based on the difference of the g-factor for electron and positron, was shown in Refs. [\cite=Penning], in which an alternative figure of merit was proposed, able to constrain the Lorentz-violating coefficients (in the electron-positron sector) to 1 part in 1020. Other interesting and precise experiments, also devised to establish stringent bounds on Lorentz violation, proposed new figures of merit involving the analysis of the hyperfine structure of the muonium ground state [\cite=Muon], clock-comparison experiments [\cite=Clock], hyperfine spectroscopy of hydrogen and anti-hydrogen [\cite=Hydrog], and experiments with macroscopic samples of spin-polarized matter [\cite=Spin].

The influence of Lorentz-violating and CPT-odd terms specifically on the Dirac equation has been studied in Refs. [\cite=Halmi], with the evaluation of the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian and the associated energy-level shifts. A similar investigation searching for deviations on the spectrum of hydrogen has been recently performed in Ref. [\cite=Fernando], where the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian was derived directly from the modified Pauli equation. Some interesting energy-level shifts, such as a Zeeman-like splitting, were then reported. These results may also be used to set up bounds on the Lorentz-violating parameters.

More recently, in the work of Ref. [\cite=ACNminimo], fermions have been reassessed and the influence of a non-minimally coupled Lorentz-violating background present in the Dirac equation has been investigated. It has been shown that such a coupling, given in the form εμναβγμvνFαβ, is able to induce topological phases (Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher [\cite=Casher]) on the wave function of an electron (interacting with the gauge field and in the presence of the fixed background). Next, in connection with this particular effect, it has been found out that (non-minimally coupled) particles and antiparticles may develop opposite Aharonov-Casher (A-C) phases whenever particular backgrounds are introduced to realize Lorentz-symmetry violation. This fact, with a suitable experiment, may be used to constrain the Lorentz-violating parameter [\cite=Thales]. This coupling in the Dirac equation, with special attention to its nonrelativistic regime and possible implications on the hydrogen spectrum, was recently studied in [\cite=Manohidro]. In these papers, the analysis of the non-relativistic regime of the Dirac equation has revealed that topological quantum phases are induced whenever the fermion is coupled to the fixed background and the gauge field in a non-minimal way. More specifically, it has been found out that a neutral particle acquires a magnetic moment (induced by the background), which originates the A-C phase subject to the action of an external electric field [\cite=Casher]. It is worthy stressing that the standard Aharonov-Casher phase is currently interpreted as due to a Lorentz change in the observer frame. In our proposal, namely, in a situation where Lorentz symmetry is violated, it rather emerges as a phase whose origin is ascribed to the presence of a privileged direction in the space-time, set up by the fixed background. Since in this kind of model Lorentz invariance in the particle frame is broken, the Aharonov-Casher effect could not any longer be obtained by a suitable Lorentz change in the observer frame.

Different lines for approaching field theories with Lorentz symmetry violation in connection with supersymmetry have been carried out in the works of Ref. [\cite=susybelich]. The present work has as its main goal to examine the effects of a Lorentz-violating background vector, with non-minimal coupling [\cite=ACNminimo] in the context of an N=1 supersymmetric quantum-mechanical model. A good motivation to justify the study of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics in connection with Lorentz-symmetry violation is the natural way the spin degrees of freedom appear: spin interactions do not need to be introduced by hand, they rather come in as a consequence of the fact that the spin coordinates are the supersymmetric partners of the space coordinates that describe the particles. This is very clear if one adopts right from the beginning a superspace approach, with superfields and actions written directly in superspace. We could essentially state that our present work sets out to state that the quantum-mechanical description of a particle with spin, non-minimally coupled to a background vector that implements the breaking of Lorentz symmetry, and in the presence of an electromagnetic field has an intrinsic N=1-supersymmetry, the space coordinate and the spin being the components of the same supermultiplet. We believe this fact may be a convincing motivation to support the introduction of supersymmetry.

The N=1-supersymetry approach for a particle with spin and non-minimally coupled to an external electromagnetic field is presented in the sequel, wich is a generalization to three spatial dimensions of the planar theory of Ref. [\cite=Paschoal]. The superaction S for the non-relativistic particle coupled as described above is given as below:

[formula]

where [formula] is the supercoordinate of the particle, [formula] is an arbitrary differentiable vector function of the supercoordinate and M and q are real parameters.

[formula] can be expanded according to:

[formula]

with [formula]. xj are the three coordinates of the particle, λj are their Grassmannian supersymmetric partners and θ the Grassmannian coordinate that parametrizes the superspace [formula] By following the conventional approach to supersymmetry in superspace, we can write the supersymmetry covariant derivative as follows:

[formula]

Using the fact that for Grassmannian coordinates [formula], we may write down the Lagrangian in terms of the superfield components; in so doing, the kinetic term reads as below:

[formula]

Upon a Taylor expansion of the potential superfield in the superaction and using the fact that λ is a Grassmannian coordinate, a more conventional  form of the potential Lagrangian is obtained (after splitting  the symmetric and skew-symmetric parts of  ∂jAi):

[formula]

The non-minimal coupling to a Lorentz-symmetry violating background vector was proposed and studied in the works of Ref. [\cite=ACNminimo]. Here, we can formally introduce this non-minimal coupling by redefining the vector potential as indicated below:

[formula]

Another consequence of the non-minimal coupling is to add the term [formula] to the Hamiltonian or, equivalently, to subtract this term in the Lagrangian. However, according to the results of Ref. [\cite=Paschoal], in order to insure the realization of an N=1 supersymmetry, the condition that follows below must be fulfilled:

[formula]

For the sake of convenience, we define a magnetic dipole moment variable, [formula]:with that, we are left with the following interaction Lagrangian:

[formula]

with the complete Lagrangian written as L  =  Lkin  +  Lint.

The canonical generalized moment associated to the particle coordinate reads as:

[formula]

where we observe the Aharonov-Casher phase as a consequence of the breaking of the Lorentz symmetry. This also illustrates that the coupling of the particle to the background is the responsible for the appearance of the magnetic dipole moment, [formula], as pointed out and discussed in Ref. [\cite=ACNminimo].

From this formalism, the general Hamiltonian can be obtained after a Legendre transformation:

[formula]

where the πi 's are the fermionic generalized momenta

[formula]

that correspond to the second class constraints

[formula]

and the εi's are the corresponding Lagrange multipliers.

The consistence condition, [formula] along with the Grassmannian equations of motion, [formula]and [formula], allow us to obtain the Lagrange multipliers: Substituting this in the Hamiltonian, one obtains:

[formula]

which is the same one obtained in the work of Ref. [\cite=ACNminimo] by means of a different procedure.

Now, regarding the quantization procedure, it is necessary to calculate the Dirac brackets between all the Hamilton variables. Such a result has already been obtained in Ref. [\cite=teitel]; as long as the Grassmannian coordinates, λi, are concerned, we get that

[formula]

which, after the quantization procedure, turns into the following anti-commutator relation (:

[formula]

where the hats stand for an operator.

As we have shown above, the Lagrangian that contains the elements for the A-C effect in the presence of Lorentz-symmetry violation can naturally be described in a supersymmetric quantum framework. The role played by the spin coordinates, which can be associated to the partners of the space coordinates, λi, is crucial in ensuring the supersymmetric structure of the model, and it is the Poisson Bracket between λi and λj, the key ingredient to associating the λ- coordinate components of a spin-1/2 operator, which can be realized in terms of the Pauli matrices.

So, to conclude, we would like to stress  and comment on a few issues. By adopting superspace and superfields, we have been able to present an action in terms of components where a particle with spin undergoes the Aharonov-Casher effect. This phase is a natural result of the interaction between the particle and a background vector that introduces a spatial anisotropy. Here, we should make a remark concerning the charge of the test particle. Usually, the A-C effect is presented as an effect of external electric fields on neutral particles with spin. In our model, we consider, however, from the beginning, a charged particle. Of course, charged particles may also develop an A-C phase, but the intrinsic interest of the effect is for neutral test particles. To describe the latter, we go back to the interaction Lagrangian of Eq. ([\ref=A3]) and set to zero the parameter q. In so doing, there remain the terms proportional to the components of the background vector.

An issue that might deserve some attention regards the relationship between possible extended supersymmetries and the tensor nature of the background that implements the violation of Lorentz symmetry. It may happen that, by introducing the breaking by means of higher rank tensors, the underlying supersymmetry may be larger than N=1. We know, from the study of Dirac's equation in the presence of magnetic fields, that, depending on the field configurations, we may have an N >   1 SUSY. In our case, the possibility of extended SUSY is connected to the particular tensor character of the background. This is another point of possible interesting.

As a final comment, we would like to stress that, contrary to what happens in the case of field theory, the violation of Lorentz symmetry by the external background vector does not imply the automatic breaking of SUSY. For fields, the SUSY algebra is based on the assumption of an underlying Lorentz symmetry; here, in the case of non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics, the background vector components, v0 and [formula], act as mere parameters while SUSY takes place in a one-dimensional world parametrized by the time coordinate. In the case of field theory, SUSY is introduced in space-time, where v0 and [formula] are components of a four-vector.
