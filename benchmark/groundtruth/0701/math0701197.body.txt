Introduction

It can be advantageous to perform infinite-dimensional differential calculus in general locally convex spaces, without completeness conditions. First of all, the theory becomes clearer and more transparent if completeness conditions are stated explicitly as hypotheses for those results which really depend on them, but omitted otherwise. Secondly, it simplifies practical applications if completeness properties only need to be checked when they are really needed. Therefore, various authors have defined and discussed Ck-maps (and analytic maps) between locally convex spaces without completeness hypotheses (see [\cite=RES], [\cite=GaN], [\cite=Gro] and [\cite=Kel]; cf. [\cite=BaS]). In this article, we compile examples which illustrate the differences between various differentiability and analyticity properties of vector-valued functions, in particular differences which depend on non-completeness of the range space. Primarily, we consider continuous mappings f:U  →  F, where [formula] is open and F a complex locally convex space. Let us call such a map [formula] if the complex derivative [formula] exists for each z∈U, and f':U  →  F is continuous. As usual, we say that f is [formula] if it has continuous complex derivatives f(j):U  →  F for all [formula] such that j  ≤  k (where f(j): = (f(j - 1))'). Finally, call f complex analytic if it is of the form [formula] close to each given point z0∈U, for suitable elements an∈F. The weakest relevant completeness property of F is Mackey completeness, which (among many others) can be defined by each of the following equivalent conditions:

The Riemann integral [formula] exists in F for each smooth curve [formula].

[formula] converges in F for each bounded sequence [formula] in F and each sequence [formula] of scalars such that [formula].

If F is Mackey complete, the following properties are known to be equivalent:

[formula] is complex analytic;

f is [formula];

f is [formula];

f is weakly analytic, i.e. [formula] is complex analytic for each continuous linear functional [formula];

[formula] for each triangle Δ  ⊆  U;

[formula] for each z0∈U, r > 0 such that [formula], and each z in the interior of [formula] (where [formula].

Here (a) and (b) remain equivalent if F fails to be Mackey complete (see [\cite=Gro] or [\cite=BGN]) and also (d), (e) and (f) remain equivalent (because f may be considered as a map into the completion of F for this purpose; see also [\cite=Gro]). However, [formula]-maps need not be [formula] (and hence need not be complex analytic) in this case, as an example in Hervé's book [\cite=Her] shows (for which only a partial proof is provided there). Our first goal is to give examples which distinguish between the properties (a)-(f) in a more refined way. Thus, we describe functions satisfying (d)-(f) but which are not [formula], and also [formula]-maps which are not [formula], for each [formula] (Theorem [\ref=mainres]). In particular, the latter functions are [formula] but not complex analytic, like Hervé's example. We mention that similar functions have been recorded in unpublished parts of the thesis [\cite=Gro] (Chapter II, Example 2.3), but also there a crucial step of the proof is left to the reader. Furthermore, our discussion is based on a different argument: At its heart is the linear independence of the functions [formula], n  ↦  nkzn in the space [formula] of complex sequences, for [formula] and [formula] (see, e.g. [\cite=LaP]). As a byproduct, this argument entails refined results concerning completeness properties of free locally convex spaces over subsets of [formula] (see Proposition [\ref=consfree]), which go beyond the known general facts concerning free locally convex spaces (as in [\cite=Usp]). Examples concerning real analyticity are given as well, as are examples concerning maps f:U  →  F, where E and F are locally convex spaces over [formula] and U  ⊆  E an open set. Various differentiability and analyticity properties of such maps f are regularly used in applications of infinite-dimensional calculus, notably in infinite-dimensional Lie theory:

Given [formula], f is called a [formula]-map in the sense of Keller's Ckc-theory if f is continuous, the iterated directional (real or complex) derivatives

[formula]

exist in F for all [formula] such that j  ≤  k, x∈U and [formula], and the maps djf:U  ×  Ej  →  F so defined are continuous (see, e.g., [\cite=Kel], [\cite=RES] and [\cite=GaN]). As usual, [formula]-maps are also called smooth.

If [formula], f is called complex analytic if f is continuous and for each x∈U, there exists a 0-neighbourhood Y  ⊆  U - x and continuous, complex homogeneous polynomials pn:E  →  F of degree n such that

[formula]

for all y∈Y, with pointwise convergence (see [\cite=BaS]).

If [formula], following [\cite=Mil], [\cite=RES] and [\cite=GaN], the map f:U  →  F is called real analytic if it extends to a complex analytic [formula]-valued map on an open neighbourhood of U in the complexification [formula].

It is known that complex analytic maps coincide with [formula]-maps (see [\cite=BGN] or [\cite=GaN]), and furthermore compositions of composable [formula]-maps (resp., [formula]-analytic maps) are [formula] (resp., [formula]-analytic) for [formula] (see [\cite=BGN] or [\cite=GaN]; cf. [\cite=RES]). Occasionally, authors use a different notion of real analytic maps:

In [\cite=BaS], f is called real analytic if it is continuous and locally of the form ([\ref=sumhomo]) with continuous, real homogeneous polynomials pn.

This approach is not useful in general because one is not able to prove (without extra assumptions) that compositions of such maps are again of the same type. Finally:

Bourbaki [\cite=BVA] defines analytic maps from open subsets of normed spaces to quasi-complete locally convex spaces in a way (not recalled here) which forces such maps to be locally bounded (cf. [\cite=BVA]).[formula]

It is known that Bourbaki's notion of complex analyticity coincides with the one from (ii) for maps between Banach spaces (cf. [\cite=BaS]). It is also known that real analyticity as in (iv) coincides with the one from (iii) if E is a Fréchet space and F Mackey complete (cf. [\cite=BaS] for the crucial case where  F is sequentially complete). Nonetheless, the concepts differ in general. We illustrate the differences with simple examples: In Proposition [\ref=propreal] (announced in [\cite=GCX]), we describe a smooth map [formula] to some (non-Mackey complete) real locally convex space F which is locally given by its Taylor series around each point (and thus real analytic in the inadequate sense of (iv)), but not real analytic in the sense of (iii). In Section [\ref=secnbd], we provide an example of a map [formula] on the space [formula] of absolutely summable complex sequences which is complex analytic in the sense of (ii) but unbounded on each non-empty open subset of [formula]. As a consequence, f is not complex analytic in Bourbaki's sense (as in (v)). In particular, this means that the equivalence of (i) and (ii) in [\cite=BVA] is false (which asserts that complex analytic maps in Bourbaki's sense coincide with complex differentiable maps). For complex analytic maps in the sense of (ii), ample boundedness can be used as an adequate substitute for ordinary boundedness (see [\cite=Gro]; cf. also [\cite=BaS]). General conventions. We write [formula] and [formula]. If [formula] is a normed space over [formula] (e.g., [formula]), we write BEr(x): = {y∈E:|y - x| < r} and [formula] for x∈E and r > 0. Given a vector space E over a field [formula] and a subset M  ⊆  E, we write [formula] for the vector subspace of E spanned by M.

Examples of [formula]-maps which are not [formula]

For [formula] and [formula], we define

[formula]

Let [formula] be a non-empty open subset and [formula] be a superset of eU (for example, [formula], [formula]). For [formula], we let [formula] be the vector subspace spanned by the functions hj,z with z∈M and [formula] such that j  ≤  k. We give Ek the topology induced by the direct product [formula] and define

[formula]

For each [formula], the map fk:U  →  Ek is [formula] but not [formula] (and hence not complex analytic). Furthermore, f0:U  →  E0 is weakly analytic but not [formula] (and hence not complex analytic).

The following fact is crucial for our proof of Theorem [\ref=mainres]. It is known in the theory of linear difference equations with constant coefficients (see, e.g., [\cite=LaP]; cf. [\cite=Nor]). For the reader's convenience, we give a self-contained proof.

Step 1: To prove Lemma [\ref=linind], we only need to show that [formula] is a linearly independent family of functions in [formula]. This follows from the fact that the multiplication operator [formula], [formula] with [formula] is a linear automorphism and [formula], for all [formula]. Step 2: For each fixed [formula], the functions hk,z ([formula]) are linearly independent. In fact, if [formula], [formula] and [formula], then [formula] for each [formula] and thus [formula], entailing that [formula]. Step 3: Now consider the shift operator [formula], S(f)(n) = f(n + 1). Then S is a linear endomorphism of the space [formula] of all complex sequences. Given [formula], we let Vz be the generalized eigenspace of S, consisting of all [formula] such that (S - z)kf = 0 for some [formula]. Then hk,z∈Vz for each [formula] and [formula], by a trivial induction: If k = 0, we have ((S - z)h0,z)(n) = zn + 1 - zn + 1 = 0. If k  ≥  1, then ((S - z)hk,z)(n) = (n + 1)kzn + 1 - nkzn + 1 = ((n + 1)k - nk)zn + 1. Hence (S - z)hk,z is a linear combination of [formula], each of which is in Vz by induction. Step 4: The sum [formula] of generalized eigenspaces being direct, the assertion follows from Steps 1-3.

Also the following simple lemma is useful for the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainres] and later arguments. It is a variant of [\cite=BGN].

(a) By the Chain Rule, [formula] is [formula] with [formula], from which the assertion follows.

(b) In view of (a), we only need to prove sufficiency of the described condition. We proceed by induction on k. The case k = 0 being trivial, assume that k  ≥  1. If f satisfies the described condition, then [formula] as y  →  x, showing that f|E0 is differentiable with (f|E0)' = f'|E0. Since f'|E0 is [formula] by induction, we see that f is [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainres]. Consider the map [formula], [formula]. The n-th component [formula], z  ↦  ezn of f being [formula] for each n, also the map f into the direct product [formula] is [formula] (see [\cite=GaN] or [\cite=BGN]), with [formula] and thus f(j)(z) = hj,ez. If j  ≤  k, then hj,ez∈Ek and thus f(j)(U)  ⊆  Ek. Thus fk = f|Ek is [formula], by Lemma [\ref=basictool] (b). However, [formula] by Definition of Ek and Proposition [\ref=linind]. Hence fk = f|Ek is not [formula], by Lemma [\ref=basictool] (b). If k = 0, then f0 is not [formula] by the preceding. However, [formula] for each triangle Δ  ⊆  U (by "(b)⇒  (e)" in the introduction), because f is [formula]. Hence f0 satisfies property (e) from the introduction and hence f0 is weakly analytic. [formula]

Example of a complex analytic map which is not locally bounded

Let [formula] be the space of absolutely summable complex sequences with its usual norm [formula]. We define

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula], [formula]. We now show, using the notion of complex analyticity described in  (ii) in the introduction:

The map [formula] is complex analytic. It is unbounded on each non-empty open subset of E.

As a preliminary, we discuss g.

Since the partial sums [formula], [formula] are polynomials in the point evaluations x  ↦  xk (which are continuous linear functionals) and hence complex analytic, g will be complex analytic if we can show that each x∈E has an open neighbourhood U such that [formula] converges uniformly (see [\cite=BaS]). There is [formula] such that [formula] for all k  ≥  m. Set U: = BE1 / 4(x). Then [formula] for all y∈U and thus [formula], which entails uniform convergence on U. Given x∈E and [formula], there exists [formula] such that |2xm| < 1 and 2m  ≥  N + |g(x)| + 1. Set [formula], where yk: = xk if [formula], and ym: = 1. Then [formula] and |g(y)| = |g(x) + 2m - 2mx2mm|  ≥  2m - |g(x)| - 2m|xm|2m  ≥  N. Thus g is unbounded on [formula].

Proof of Proposition [\ref=propunb]. Given x∈E and a neighbourhood U of x in E, there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Then [formula], whence [formula] is unbounded, by Lemma [\ref=lemong]. Therefore the projection of f(U) on the n-th component is unbounded and thus f(U) is unbounded. [formula]

Mappings to products and real analyticity

We describe a map [formula] which is not real analytic although each of its components [formula] is real analytic (see also [\cite=Gro] for a very similar example).

For each [formula], the map [formula], [formula] is real analytic and its Taylor series around 0 has radius of convergence [formula]. It follows that the Taylor series around 0 of the smooth map

[formula]

has radius of convergence 0, and thus f is not real analytic.

Example of a map which is not real analytic although it admits Taylor expansions

We describe a smooth map [formula] to a suitable real locally convex space E which is given locally by its Taylor series around each point, but which does not admit a complex analytic extension and hence fails to be real analytic. We observe first that such a pathology cannot occur if E is Mackey complete. Real analyticity is understood as in (iii) in the introduction.

The hypothesis means that f is a real analytic map in the sense of [\cite=BaS]. If F is sequentially complete, [\cite=BaS] provides a complex analytic extension for f into [formula] (because E is a Fréchet space), and thus f is real analytic in the desired sense. If F is merely Mackey complete, we know from the preceding that f is real analytic as a map into the completion [formula] of F. Let [formula] be a complex analytic extension of f to an open neighbourhood [formula] of U. Given x∈U, let [formula] be a balanced, open 0-neighbourhood with x + W  ⊆  V. Then [formula] for each w∈Wx, where [formula]. Given w∈Wx, there exists t > 1 such that tx∈Wx. Then [formula] converges in [formula], whence [formula] is a bounded sequence in [formula]. Since [formula], the second characterization (M2) of Mackey completeness in the introduction shows that [formula] converges in [formula]. Thus [formula]. So, after replacing V by [formula], we may assume that [formula]. Then [formula] is complex analytic (see [\cite=GaN]) and thus f:U  →  F is real analytic.

Let E be the space of all sequences [formula] of real numbers which have polynomial growth, i.e., there exists [formula] such that the sequence [formula] is bounded. We equip E with the topology induced by [formula].

For E as before, the map

[formula]

is smooth and [formula] in E, for all [formula]. However, f is not real analytic.

The map [formula], g(t): = f(t) is smooth, since all components [formula], gn(t) =  sin (nt) are smooth. We have [formula] and [formula] for each [formula] and [formula], whence f = g|E is smooth (by Lemma [\ref=basictool] (b)). Given [formula], we have [formula] for each [formula] and [formula]. Since E is equipped with the topology induced by [formula], it follows that [formula] for all [formula] and thus f is given globally by its Taylor series around each point. The map g is real analytic, because

[formula]

is a complex analytic extension of g. If f was complex analytic, then we would have [formula] for some open neighbourhood V of [formula] in [formula]. Then it∈V for t > 0 sufficiently small. However

[formula]

for large n and hence the sequence [formula] does not have polynomial growth. Thus [formula], a contradiction.

Consequences for free locally convex spaces

Given [formula] and a completely regular topological space M, there exists a Hausdorff locally convex topological [formula]-vector space [formula] and a continuous map [formula] with the following properties (see [\cite=Mar]):

Algebraically, [formula] is the free [formula]-vector space ([formula]) over the set M;

For each continuous map α:M  →  E to a locally convex topological [formula]-vector space E, there exists a unique continuous [formula]-linear map [formula] such that [formula].

[formula] is determined by these properties up to canonical isomorphism; it is called the free locally convex topological [formula]-vector space over M.

If [formula] is a subset with non-empty interior M0, then neither [formula] nor [formula] is Mackey complete.

Since [formula] is homeomorphic to the disk [formula], after replacing M with a homeomorphic copy we may assume that [formula]. By §[\ref=reducecx], we only need to show that [formula] is not Mackey complete. Let [formula] be a non-empty open set with compact closure [formula], such that [formula]. Set [formula], with h0,z as in ([\ref=defhs]). Write E0 for E, equipped with the topology induced by the direct product [formula]. Let O be the finest locally convex topology on E such that η:M  →  E, z  ↦  h0,z is continuous. Since the topology on E0 is Hausdorff and makes η continuous, it follows that ι:(E,O)  →  E0, x  ↦  x is continuous and O is Hausdorff. Since (h0,z)z∈M is a basis for E by Proposition [\ref=linind], it follows that (E,O) is the free complex locally convex space [formula] over M (together with η). Now consider

[formula]

Then [formula] is continuous, entailing that [formula] is compact and hence bounded in (E,O). The restrictions [formula] of the projections [formula], [formula] are continuous linear on (E,O) and separate points. Furthermore, [formula], z  ↦  enz is complex analytic for each [formula]. Hence, if (E,O) was Mackey complete, then g|U:U  →  E would be complex analytic (by [\cite=Gr2]). But then also the map [formula] considered in Theorem [\ref=mainres] would be complex analytic, which it is not: contradiction. Hence [formula] is not Mackey complete.

In the literature, one finds various results concerning [formula] and its completion, which can be realized as a certain space of measures (see [\cite=Usp], also [\cite=Flo]). A result from [\cite=Usp] is of particular relevance: [formula] is complete if and only if M is Dieudonné complete and its compact subsets are finite. Hence [formula] and [formula] are non-complete in the situation of Proposition [\ref=consfree]. Our proposition provides the additional information that [formula] and [formula] are not sequentially complete either, nor Mackey complete.

Let us close with some observations concerning the free (not necessarily locally convex !) topological [formula]-vector space [formula] over a completely regular topological space M (obtained by replacing the topology on [formula] with the finest vector topology making η continuous). To start with, let [formula] be a compact set with non-empty interior. Let [formula]. Then [formula] is complete, by [\cite=AaK]. If [formula] was locally convex, we would have [formula] and so [formula] would be complete, contrary to Proposition [\ref=consfree]. We conclude: [formula] is not locally convex. This argument can be generalized further. To this end, recall that a Hausdorff topological space M is said to be a kω-space if there exists a sequence [formula] of compact subsets of M with union M (a "kω-sequence") such that [formula] as a topological space  (see, e.g., [\cite=GGH] and the references therein for further information). For instance, every σ-compact locally compact topological space is a kω-space. Each kω-space is normal (by [\cite=Han]) and hence completely regular, ensuring that both [formula] and [formula] are defined. We show:

If M is a non-discrete kω-space, then neither [formula] nor [formula] is locally convex.

Let [formula] be a kω-sequence for M. If each Kn was finite, then Kn would be discrete and hence also [formula] would be discrete, contradicting the hypothesis. Therefore some Kn is infinite, whence [formula] (and hence also [formula]) is not complete, by Uspenski's result recalled in Remark [\ref=remusp]. Since [formula] is complete by the next lemma, we see that it cannot coincide with [formula] and hence cannot be locally convex.

Since each abelian topological group which is a kω-space is complete [\cite=Rai], we only need to show that [formula] is a kω-space. To this end, it is convenient to identify M via η with a subset of [formula]. We pick a kω-sequence [formula] for M. Define [formula] (with 2n summands) for [formula]. Then [formula] is a sequence of compact subsets of [formula], with union [formula]. The topology O making [formula] the direct limit topological space [formula] is finer than the original topology and makes [formula] a kω-space. We now write W for [formula], equipped with the topology O. Because the inclusion map ι:M  →  W restricts to a continuous map on Kn for each n (since we can pass over Ln), we see that ι is continuous (as [formula]). To complete the proof, it only remains to show that O is a vector topology. Since [formula] (see [\cite=DIR]), the addition map α:W  ×  W  →  W will be continuous if α|Kn  ×  Kn is continuous for each n. Since Kn + Kn  ⊆  Kn + 1 and W induces the same topology on Kn and on Kn + 1 as [formula], continuity of α|Kn  ×  Kn follows from the continuity of the addition map [formula]. Likewise, since [formula] and [formula], we deduce from the continuity of the scalar multiplication map [formula] that also the scalar multiplication [formula] is continuous.

Similar arguments show that the free topological group and the free abelian topological group over a kω-space are kω-spaces (see [\cite=MMO]).
