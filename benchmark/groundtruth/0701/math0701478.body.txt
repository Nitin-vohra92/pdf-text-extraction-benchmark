Generating spaces of modular forms with η-quotients

Introduction

Let z be an element of the Poincaré upper half plane H, and let q: =  exp (2πiz). We recall the definition of the Dedekind η-function:

[formula]

It is well-known that this function plays an important role in the theory of modular forms; for instance, the unique normalised cusp form of level 1 and weight 12, the Δ function, can be written as Δ(q) = η(q)24.

Another classical application of the η-function is to the theory of partitions; a partition of n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers; for instance, 4 = 2 + 2 is a partition of 4. The number of partitions of n, p(n), grows quickly with n. For instance, in the early years of the 20th century, MacMahon computed that p(200) = 397299029388. The reciprocal of the η-function (with the q1 / 24 removed) gives the following generating function for the p(n):

[formula]

It can be shown that η(q)24 is a modular form for [formula] In [\cite=apostol], an explicit transformation formula for η(q) under the action of [formula] is given; it is of the form

[formula]

where ε24 = 1. (The explicit definition of ε, which depends on a,b,c,d, is complicated, but is given in Theorem 3.4 of [\cite=apostol]).

We see from [\eqref=eta-transformation-formula] that η(q) satisfies a "weight 1 / 2" transformation formula, which is consistent with the statement that Δ is a weight 12 modular form.

Let N be a positive integer, let {rδ} be a set of integers, and let f be a meromorphic function from the Poincarè upper half plane to [formula] of the form

[formula]

We call f an η-quotient, and if all of the rδ are non-negative we say that f is an η-product.

We see that Δ is an η-product; we will see some examples of η-quotients which are modular forms below.

There are some general theorems which tell us when an η-quotient is a classical modular form, by telling us how it transforms under elements of certain congruence subgroups.

Suppose that f(z) is an η-quotient which satisfies the following properties:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then f(z) satisfies

[formula]

for every [formula], where [formula], and

[formula]

In [\cite=ono-web-of-modularity], the following question is posed:

Which spaces of classical modular forms can be generated by sums of η-quotients?

It is well-known (see for instance [\cite=serre-cours], Corollary 2 to Theorem VII.4) that every modular form of level 1 is a polynomial in the Eisenstein series E4 and E6, so if we can write E4 and E6 in terms of η-quotients then we can write every modular form of level 1 in terms of η-quotients. In [\cite=ono-web-of-modularity], we see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

One can check that these are identities of modular forms by verifying that each of these η-quotients is a modular form on Γ0(4) and that the q-expansions of both sides agree up to a suitable bound, such as the Sturm bound [\cite=stein-sturm] (also known as the Hecke bound); if a modular form has a zero at the cusp ∞   of large enough degree, then it must be the zero modular form. In this case, we find that the dimension of the space M4(Γ0(4)) is 3, and the Sturm bound here is 2. We can use a computer algebra package to check that these really are equalities.

In this paper we will give further examples of this form, and prove a theorem which says that we can write every modular form for a congruence subgroup Γ0(N) in terms of η-quotients of level at most Γ0(4N).

Writing eigenforms as η-products or η-quotients

We will briefly consider η-products, and show that there are only finitely many spaces of modular forms which can be generated by η-products. These do exist: for instance, [formula], and [formula]. However, it is clear that only finitely many spaces of modular forms can be completely generated by η-products, as there are only finitely many η-products with q-expansion of the form qa + O(qa + 1) for any a; this follows from equation ([\ref=sum-of-r-delta]), because as the level increases the sum increases also.

Questions of this sort have been asked before; in [\cite=biagioli], the question of when an η product is also a simultaneous eigenform for the Hecke operators Tp is addressed. In [\cite=dummit-et-al], a complete list of the 30 different η-products which are classical modular cuspidal eigenforms of integer weight with no zeroes outside the cusps is given (two of these have half-integral weight). Another proof of this classification was given by [\cite=koike-eta-products].

Similarly, in [\cite=martin-eta-quotients], a complete list of all η-quotients which are holomorphic new eigenforms of integral weight for the congruence subgroups Γ1(N) is derived. There are 74 of these, with levels ranging from [formula] (the Δ-function) up to Γ1(576) (the modular form η(q12)- 2  ·  η(q24)6  ·  η(q48)- 2∈S1(Γ1(576))). There have been other investigations; in [\cite=koehler], a list of the 65 η-products which have weight 1 and level Γ*(36) is given; the congruence subgroup Γ*(N) is generated by Γ0(36) and the Fricke involution [formula]. Another angle of inquiry about η-products is given in [\cite=gordon-robins], which considers η-products which are lacunary modular forms; in other words, they have many zero Fourier coefficients.

Sums of η-products and η-quotients

We see that, from the results we have mentioned in the previous section, if we are to generate all spaces of modular forms for a given congruence subgroup Γ we will need to expand from η-products and η-quotients to consider more general objects. We will consider sums of η-products and η-quotients in this section.

From equation [\eqref=how-eta-quotients-transform], we see that the only characters we can have are the Legendre symbols, so if we are considering congruence subgroups containing Γ1(N) we are restricted to the cases of Γ0(N) and Γ0(N) plus a character of order 2.

We will be using the standard formulae for the dimension of spaces of modular forms in this section; these can be found in many books on modular forms; one reference is Theorem 3.5.1 and Figure 3.3 of [\cite=diamond-shurman]. Let g = ⌊(p + 1) / 12⌋ if [formula] and ⌊(p + 1) / 12⌋ - 1 otherwise (this is the genus of X0(p)). The formulae (if N = p is prime) are (for k  ≥  4 and N  ≥  5):

[formula]

The dimension of S2(Γ0(p)) is g, and the dimension of the space of Eisenstein series is 1 if k = 2 and 2 if k  ≥  4 (the Eisenstein series of weight k  ≥  4 are the images of Ek under the two degeneracy maps from level 1 to level p, and the Eisenstein series of weight 2 is defined in terms of the Eisenstein series of weight 2 which is not a modular form). There are similar formulae for N composite and for other congruence subgroups.

We will first consider some more examples of spaces of modular forms which can be generated by η-quotients: for example, we can write every modular form of level Γ0(2) as a sum of η-quotients. It will suffice to show that M2(Γ0(2)), M4(Γ0(2)), M6(Γ0(2)) and M8(Γ0(2)) can be generated by sums of η-quotients, because the following relation holds:

[formula]

where f = λ  ·  (η(z)  ·  η(2z))8∈S8(Γ0(2)). This can be derived from the dimension formulae that we have given above.

Because we can write level 1 modular forms as sums of η-quotients, and we know (for instance, from Proposition III.3.19 of [\cite=koblitz]) that the unique normalised cusp-form f of weight 8 and level Γ0(2) is an η-quotient, we need only to consider M2(Γ0(2)), which is 1-dimensional. Using Magma [\cite=magma], and the fact that the Hecke bound for the space M2(Γ0(8)) is 3, we see that

[formula]

so every modular form of level Γ0(2) can be written as a sum of η-quotients. We need to consider the space of level Γ0(8) because the η-quotients have level Γ0(8).

Similarly, to show that every modular form for Γ0(3) is a sum of η-quotients, we need to check that E3,2∈M2(Γ0(3)) is a sum of η-quotients. After some calculation, we find (using the fact that the Hecke bound for M2(Γ0(27)) is 6) that

[formula]

is equal to E3,2; this, together with the knowledge that [formula] and that the Eisenstein series of weights 4 and 6 and level Γ0(3) are oldforms and therefore the image of forms of level 1 which can be written as η quotients, shows us that we can write modular forms of level Γ0(3) as sums of η quotients of level at most [formula].

In fact, we can write E4 and E6 as sums of eta-quotients of level 27, so we can actually write every modular form for Γ0(3) in terms of η quotients of level 27.

In a similar fashion, we can write the elements of M3(Γ1(3)) as a linear combination of η(q3)9  /  η(q)3 and η(q)9  /  η(q3)3; these, together with the Eisenstein series of level 3 and weights 2,4 and 6 and the cusp form of level 3 and weight 6 generate all of the modular forms of level 3 and odd weight, so we can write every modular form of level Γ1(3) as a sum of η-quotients.

We can prove similar results for level Γ1(4) as well. Using Exercise III.3.17 of Koblitz's book on modular forms [\cite=koblitz], we see that every f∈Mk(Γ1(4)) can be written as a polynomial in the modular forms F: = η(q4)8  /  η(q2)4, which has weight 2, and θ2: = η(q2)10 / (η(q)4η(q4)4), which has weight 1. As both of these are η-quotients, we are done; every modular form of level Γ1(4) can be written as a sum of η-quotients of level at most 4.

A rather tedious Magma calculation shows us that the unique Eisenstein series E5,2 of level Γ0(5) and weight 2 can be written as the following sum of η-quotients of level Γ0(20):

[formula]

This follows because these six η-quotients generate M2(Γ0(20)), where E5,2 appears as an oldform. We can find the coefficients of these using linear algebra.

In a very similar way, we can write both elements of [formula] as η-quotients by considering them as oldforms of level 20 and finding a basis of η-quotients for this space of level 20 forms. This suffices to show that all modular forms with character [formula] can be written as sums of η-quotients.

At this point, we notice that if p  ≥  5 is a prime then we cannot write every modular form for Γ0(p) as a sum of η-quotients of level pr. We use the dimension formulae for M2(Γ0(p)) to show that there is at least one Eisenstein series of weight 2 with nonzero constant term in its Fourier expansion which we need to write as a sum of η quotients, each of which has the form [formula]. Therefore, we need to solve the following two simultaneous equations:

[formula]

putting these together, we find that

[formula]

We now reduce [\eqref=reduce-eta-quotient] modulo p - 1; the left hand side vanishes, and the only way that the right hand side can vanish modulo p - 1 is if p∈{2,3,5}.

Now we consider the case when p = 5. We use the formula for the character of the η-quotient given in [\eqref=character-formula] to work on [\eqref=reduce-eta-quotient]; after dividing both sides by 4, we see that the right hand side is - 1, whereas the left hand side has only even entries (because the requirement that the character be trivial forces the sum [formula] to be even). This is a contradiction.

We can tackle Γ0(7) in a similar fashion; in this case, we have to check that we can generate M2(Γ0(7)) and M4(Γ0(7)) by η-quotients, and again we prove this by finding a basis of η-quotients for M2(Γ0(28)) and M4(Γ0(28)) and then considering the level 7 spaces as oldforms in these spaces. Here we find that

[formula]

the equations for the three cuspforms in S4(Γ0(7)) are similar.

Generating spaces of modular forms with rational functions of η-quotients

We now consider a larger set of functions than in the previous section; we will now consider rational functions of η-quotients and η-products. We will now prove the following theorem on the generation of spaces of modular forms by rational functions of η-quotients (and in fact by rational functions of η-products):

Let N be a positive integer, let k be a positive even integer, and let f∈Mk(Γ0(N)) be a modular form. Then we can write f as a rational function of η-quotients.

We first note that the classical j-invariant is an η-quotient, because we can write it as

[formula]

where E4 is an η-quotient and Δ  =  η(q)24. This means that the modular function j(qN) is also an η-quotient, for any [formula].

We now quote a theorem about the field of modular functions of weight 0 for the congruence subgroup Γ0(N); this is proved in the online notes of Milne [\cite=milne-modular-forms-notes] on modular forms and modular functions:

The field [formula] of modular functions for Γ0(N) is generated over [formula] by j(q) and j(qN). In particular, every modular function for Γ0(N) is a rational function of j(q) and j(qN).

By standard properties of modular forms, the quotient f / g of two modular forms of weight k for a congruence subgroup Γ is a modular function of weight 0 for that congruence subgroup, with possible poles at the zeroes of g.

We therefore take f∈Mk(Γ0(N)) and consider the modular function

[formula]

where we choose a∈{0,1,2}, b∈{0,1} and [formula] such that k + 4a + 6b - 12c = 0. This has weight 0 by definition, so by Theorem [\ref=milne-theorem] we can write it as a rational function of j(q) and j(qN), which are both rational functions of η-products. From before, we recall that E4, E6 and Δ are all rational functions of η-products, so we can write f as a rational function of η-products, which is what we set out to do.

It is interesting to note that we only needed to use η-products of level 4N here (the N coming from the level of our form f, and the 4 coming from the η-quotient representations of E4 and E6). This corresponds to the figures in Table [\ref=table-of-spaces], where we needed to raise the level by a factor of at least 4, corresponding to the level 4 η-quotients that we used for E4 and E6.

We see also that we have to have either the square of a prime or two distinct primes dividing the level, because we always need to write E4 and E6 in terms of η-products, and we need to find at least two different solutions to the set of simultaneous equations in the powers of the ηi (one for E4 and one for E6). This means that we need to have at least 3 i, so in particular we cannot write E4 and E6 just in terms of η-quotients of level p for any prime p.

If we are willing to raise the level then we can use g: = η(q)2η(q11)2∈S2(Γ0(11)) as a multiplier in [\eqref=f-cdot-stuff], so the only thing stopping our rational function being a polynomial is the numerator of the modular function of weight 0. However, we cannot assume that g only has a zero at ∞  , because while the modular form [formula] only has a simple zero at ∞   and no zeroes elsewhere, the modular form Δ(q)∈S12(Γ0(N)) (viewed as an oldform) has many zeroes; it has one at each cusp of Γ0(N).
