Abstract

We match the Hagedorn/deconfinement temperature of planar N = 4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) on [formula] to the Hagedorn temperature of string theory on 5  ×  S5. The match is done in a near-critical region where both gauge theory and string theory are weakly coupled. On the gauge theory side we are taking a decoupling limit found in Ref. [\cite=Harmark:2006di] in which the physics of planar N = 4 SYM is given exactly by the ferromagnetic XXX1 / 2 Heisenberg spin chain. We find moreover a general relation between the Hagedorn/deconfinement temperature and the thermodynamics of the Heisenberg spin chain. On the string theory side, we identify the dual limit which is taken of string theory on a maximally symmetric pp-wave background with a flat direction, obtained from a Penrose limit of 5  ×  S5. We compute the Hagedorn temperature of the string theory and find agreement with the Hagedorn/deconfinement temperature computed on the gauge theory side. Finally, we discuss a modified decoupling limit in which planar N = 4 SYM reduces to the XXX1 / 2 Heisenberg spin chain with an external magnetic field.

Introduction

The most beautiful example of the relation between gauge theories and string theories is the AdS/CFT correspondence which asserts an exact duality between SU(N) N  =  4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) on [formula] and type IIB string theory on 5  ×  S5 [\cite=Maldacena:1997re] [\cite=Gubser:1998bc] [\cite=Witten:1998qj]. The AdS/CFT correspondence is a strong/weak coupling duality. This is the power of the correspondence but it also makes it difficult to verify its validity. Many of the checks have involved computing physical quantities on the gauge theory side, such as the expectation value of Wilson loops [\cite=Erickson:2000af] [\cite=Drukker:2000rr] or the anomalous dimensions of gauge theory operators [\cite=Berenstein:2002jq], and extrapolating the results to strong coupling in order to compare with string theory.

In this talk we instead check the validity of the AdS/CFT correspondence avoiding the extrapolation of the results to strong coupling, following the papers [\cite=Harmark:2006di] [\cite=Harmark:2006ta] [\cite=Harmark:2006ie]. The strategy we use is to compute the Hagedorn/deconfinement temperature for planar N  =  4 SYM on [formula] at weak coupling λ  ≪  1 in a certain near-critical region found in [\cite=Harmark:2006di] and to match this to the Hagedorn temperature computed in weakly coupled string theory on 5  ×  S5, in the corresponding dual near-critical region. This successful match mostly relies on the matching of the low energy spectra of the gauge theory and the string theory in the near-critical region.

In [\cite=Witten:1998zw] [\cite=Sundborg:1999ue] [\cite=Polyakov:2001af] [\cite=Aharony:2003sx] a relation is conjectured between the Hagedorn/deconfinement temperature of planar N  =  4 SYM on [formula] and the Hagedorn temperature of string theory on 5  ×  S5. This is due to the discovery of a confinement/deconfinement phase transition in planar N  =  4 SYM on [formula] at weak coupling λ  ≪  1 [\cite=Witten:1998zw]. In particular, at high energies the theory has a Hagedorn density of states, with the Hagedorn temperature being equal to the deconfinement temperature [\cite=Sundborg:1999ue] [\cite=Polyakov:2001af] [\cite=Aharony:2003sx].

However, the fact that we do not know how to quantize string theory on 5  ×  S5 means that we cannot directly test this conjecture. One hope comes from considering certain Penrose limits where the 5  ×  S5 background becomes a maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background [\cite=Berenstein:2002jq] [\cite=Bertolini:2002nr] where type IIB string theory can be quantized. In this case in fact the Hagedorn temperature has been computed [\cite=Greene:2002cd] [\cite=PandoZayas:2002hh]. However, in order to obtain the correspondence with string theory, it is necessary to consider a strong coupling limit on the gauge theory side so that most of the gauge theory operators decouple keeping only those dual to the string states.

In this paper we take a different route by taking a decoupling limit corresponding to being in a certain near-critical region. Using this we find a gauge-theory/pp-wave correspondence appropriate for verifying the relation between the Hagedorn/deconfinement temperature of planar N  =  4 SYM on [formula] and the Hagedorn temperature of string theory on 5  ×  S5.

We expect more generally that our decoupling limits can be used to study the thermodynamics of N  =  4 SYM on [formula] and its string theory dual also above the Hagedorn temperature. It could in particular be interesting to study the connection to black holes in 5  ×  S5 [\cite=AlvarezGaume:2006jg].

Gauge theory side

The solution to find the appropriate gauge-theory/pp-wave correspondence comes from a recently found decoupling limit of thermal SU(N) N = 4 SYM on [formula] [\cite=Harmark:2006di] which is given by

[formula]

where T is the temperature for N = 4 SYM, Ω is the chemical potential associated to the three R-charges J1,J2,J3 for the SU(4) R-symmetry and it is defined as (Ω1,Ω2,Ω3) = (Ω,Ω,0). λ = g2YMN / 4π2 is the 't Hooft coupling. In the limit [\eqref=ourlim] only the states in the SU(2) sector survive, and SU(N) N = 4 SYM on [formula] reduces to a quantum mechanical theory with temperature T̃ and coupling λ̃. In fact, consider the thermal partition function of SU(N) N = 4 SYM on [formula] with non-zero chemical potentials

[formula]

where β = 1 / T is the inverse temperature, D is the dilatation operator and the trace is taken over all gauge invariant states, corresponding to all the multi-trace operators. It is convenient to combine the R-charges J1 and J2 into the following charges

[formula]

At weak coupling and in the decoupling limit [\eqref=ourlim] the partition function [\eqref=genZ] reduces to

[formula]

with H being the Hamiltonian H  =  D0  +  λ̃D2 and  = 1 / T̃. We see that SU(N) N = 4 SYM on [formula] in the limit [\eqref=ourlim] reduces to a quantum mechanical theory with Hilbert space H given by the SU(2) sector. T̃ and λ̃ can be regarded as the effective temperature and coupling of the theory.

Moreover, in the planar limit N =   ∞  , λ̃D2 becomes the Hamiltonian for the ferromagnetic XXX1 / 2 Heisenberg spin chain (without magnetic field) where [\cite=Minahan:2002ve]

[formula]

for a chain of length L, where Ii,i + 1 and Pi,i + 1 are the identity operator and the permutation operator acting on letters at position i and i + 1. We can therefore write the single-trace partition function as [\cite=Harmark:2006di]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the partition function for the ferromagnetic XXX1 / 2 Heisenberg spin chain of length L. Note that [formula] here refers to the trace over single-trace operators with J = L in the SU(2) sector. The spin chain is required to be periodic and translationally invariant in accordance with the cyclic symmetry of single-trace operators. Using the standard relation between the single-trace and multi-trace partition functions, we get [\cite=Harmark:2006di]

[formula]

Therefore, the partition function of planar SU(N) N = 4 SYM on [formula] in the decoupling limit [\eqref=ourlim] is given exactly by [\eqref=planarZ] from the partition function Z(XXX)L() of the ferromagnetic XXX1 / 2 Heisenberg spin chain [\cite=Harmark:2006di]. Using this interesting result we obtain a direct connection between the Hagedorn/deconfinement temperature for finite λ̃ and the thermodynamics of the Heisenberg spin chain expressed by the relation [\cite=Harmark:2006ta]

[formula]

where t = λ̃- 1T̃H is the temperature for the ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with Hamiltonian D2 and - tV(t) is the thermodynamic limit of the free energy per site for the Heisenberg chain. The previous relation can be used to compute the Hagedorn temperature as a function of the coupling λ̃. In the large λ̃ limit the Hagedorn temperature corresponds to the low temperature limit of the Heisenberg chain, and we obtain [\cite=Harmark:2006ta]

[formula]

where ζ(x) is the Riemann zeta function. Note that the low energy behavior of the Heisenberg chain, and thereby of the gauge theory, is tied to the large λ̃ limit. In this region the dominant states for the D2 Hamiltonian are the low energy states of the Heisenberg spin chain. In fact, the low energy spectrum consisting of the chiral primary vacua with the magnon spectrum gives rise to the Hagedorn temperature [\eqref=ourhag]. In the next section we will show that the same result [\eqref=ourhag] can be obtained by a direct string theory computation.

Before moving to the string theory side, we want to comment on a more general situation where we study thermal SU(N) N = 4 SYM on [formula] with chemical potentials for the R-charges for the SU(4) R-symmetry taken to be (Ω1,Ω2,Ω3) = (Ω + h,Ω - h,0). We see that for h = 0 we have Ω1  =  Ω2  =  Ω as previously considered. In this new situation the decoupling limit is given by [\cite=Harmark:2006ie]

[formula]

The partition function can be written as

[formula]

where the decoupled Hamiltonian H  =  D0  +  λ̃D2  -  2h̃Sz is the Hamiltonian for the ferromagnetic XXX1 / 2 Heisenberg model in the presence of an external magnetic field of magnitude h̃. The trace is again restricted to the SU(2) sector. Our new decoupling limit [\eqref=hlim] generalizes the limit [\eqref=ourlim] found in [\cite=Harmark:2006di]. In fact it reduces to that for h̃ = 0. We can in principle compute the full partition function [\eqref=decpartfct] for any value of λ̃ and h̃. We thus have an extra parameter h̃ that can be regarded both as a magnetic field, and also as an effective chemical potential.

To compute the Hagedorn temperature we then use the relation [\eqref=rel] and we obtain [\cite=Harmark:2006ie]

[formula]

String theory side

Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we find the following decoupling limit of string theory on 5  ×  S5, dual to the limit [\eqref=ourlim],

[formula]

Here E is the energy of the strings, Ji, i = 1,2,3, are the angular momenta for the five-sphere, J  =  J1 + J2, gs is the string coupling and [formula] is the string tension with R being the AdS radius and ls the string length. H̃ is the effective Hamiltonian for the strings in the decoupling limit. We see that both the string tension Tstr and the string coupling gs go to zero in this limit.

As mentioned in the Introduction, we should now take a Penrose limit of the 5  ×  S5 background and then consider the string theory on the resulting pp-wave background. This gives the following pp-wave background with 32 supersymmetries

[formula]

[formula]

This background was first found in [\cite=Michelson:2002wa]. It is important to note that in the pp-wave background [\eqref=ppmet]-[\eqref=ppF5] the direction x1 is an explicit isometry of the pp-wave [\cite=Michelson:2002wa] [\cite=Bertolini:2002nr], hence we call this background a pp-wave with a flat direction. The resulting spectrum and level matching condition are given by [\cite=Harmark:2006ta]

[formula]

[formula]

where we have defined f  =  μl2sp+ and [formula]. Here N(I)n, I = 3,...,8 and n∈Z, are the number operators for bosonic excitations for the six directions x3,...,x8, while Nn, [formula], and Mn, n  ≠  0, are the number operators for the two directions x1 and x2. F(b)n, b = 1,...,8 and [formula], are the number operators for the fermions. It is important to note that there is a vacuum for each value of the momentum along the flat direction, and that momentum is moreover dual to J1 - J2. This is exactly as on the gauge theory/spin chain side where and we have a vacuum for each value of the total spin measured by J1 - J2. Moreover we have a pp-wave spectrum for which all states with E = J, J = J1 + J2, correspond to the string vacua, again as in the gauge theory side.

By then taking the large μ limit of the pp-wave

[formula]

which is an implementation of the limit [\eqref=ouradslim], we have that the resulting spectrum, expressed in terms of gauge theory quantities via the AdS/CFT correspondence, is given by

[formula]

This precisely matches the gauge theory spectrum for large λ̃ and J in the decoupling limit [\eqref=ourlim]. Thus, we can match the spectrum of weakly coupled string theory with weakly coupled gauge theory in the corresponding decoupling limits.

It is not difficult to show that from the matching of the spectra it follows the matching of the Hagedorn temperatures [\cite=Harmark:2006ta] which also on the string side is given by equation [\eqref=ourhag] .

We have thus shown that the Hagedorn temperature of type IIB string theory on 5  ×  S5 in the decoupling limit [\eqref=ouradslim] matches with the Hagedorn/deconfinement temperature [\eqref=ourhag] computed in weakly coupled N = 4 SYM in the dual decoupling limit [\eqref=ourlim]. This is done in the regime of large λ̃. On the string side we obtained the Hagedorn temperature by considering the large λ̃ and J limit corresponding to strings on the pp-wave background [\eqref=ppmet]-[\eqref=ppF5] in the decoupling limit [\eqref=pplim]. The result means that in the sector of AdS/CFT defined by the decoupling limits we can indeed show that the Hagedorn temperature for type IIB string theory on the 5  ×  S5 background is mapped to the Hagedorn/deconfinement temperature of weakly coupled planar N = 4 SYM on [formula]. Thus we have direct evidence that the confinement/deconfinement transition found in weakly coupled planar N = 4 SYM on [formula] is linked to a Hagedorn transition of string theory on 5  ×  S5, as conjectured in [\cite=Witten:1998zw] [\cite=Sundborg:1999ue] [\cite=Polyakov:2001af] [\cite=Aharony:2003sx].

A similar computation for the spectrum and Hagedorn temperature can be done for the situation dual to the decoupling limit [\eqref=hlim]. However there are interesting differences between the two cases h̃ = 0 and h̃  ≠  0. In the first case the vacuum of the spin chain has an L + 1 fold degeneracy since the states [formula] all have the same energy for 0  ≤  M  ≤  L. In the case when an external magnetic field is present this degeneracy is removed by the Zeeman term h̃Sz and [formula] becomes the unique vacuum. An analogous difference is also present on the dual string theory side. It is possible to show that the Hagedorn temperature for the string theory dual to the gauge theory in the decoupling limit [\eqref=hlim] is given by [\eqref=hhag].
