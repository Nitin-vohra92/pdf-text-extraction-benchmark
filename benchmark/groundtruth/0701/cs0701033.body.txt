A Counterexample to a Proposed Proof of P=NP by S. Gubin

In [\cite=gubin], the claim is put forth that P=NP; the form of this claim is an algorithm which purportedly can solve the 3SAT problem in [formula] time.

The 3SAT problem (or "3-SAT problem," as it is refered to in [\cite=gubin]) is to determine if the formula

[formula]

is satisfiable, where each clause dk with 1  ≤  k  ≤  m is a disjunction of at most three variables or their negations from the set

[formula]

The validity of the algorithm rests on the following claim:

Let [\eqref=eq:formula] and [\eqref=eq:variable_set] be the given instance of 3SAT. Let C be the set of clauses of the instance:

[formula]

The instance is non-satisfiable if and only if at least one of the following is true:

This claim is incorrect. The proof supplied in [\cite=gubin] only addresses the "if" direction; that is, the following Proposition is proved, which is true.

Let [\eqref=eq:formula] and [\eqref=eq:variable_set] be the given instance of 3SAT. Let C be the set of clauses of the instance:

[formula]

The instance is non-satisfiable if any of the following are true:

There is α∈B:

[formula]

There are different α,β∈B:

[formula]

There are different α,β,γ∈B:

[formula]

The supposition is a sufficient but not necessary condition for a given formula to lack a solution. It is easy to find a counterexample.
