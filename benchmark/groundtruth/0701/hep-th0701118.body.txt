Derivation of the Entropy-area Relation for the Extremal Black Hole in Four Dimensions

Introduction

It has been a long standing problem to derive the Bekenstein-Hawking law that relates the entropy and area of the event horizon of a black hole, using statistical mechanics in terms of the microstates of the black hole. Classically, the strong gravitational field of a black hole prevents the emission of any radiation from it and the entropy associated with the black hole is zero. However, the scenario is changed when the black hole is treated as a quantum system. Quantum mechanical tunneling through the potential barrier permits the creation of particle pairs from vacuum in the strong gravitational field near the black hole. This is analogous to the electron-positron pair creation, from vacuum, by very strong electric fields. Thus quantum black holes can emit radiation into space. This radiation has the characteristic of black body radiation. So, black holes can be treated as thermodynamic systems with temperature ( in geometrized units, c = G = 1)

[formula]

where κ is the surface gravity of the black hole. When the mass of a black hole increases due to absorption of nearby stars or due to collision with other black holes, it expands and the area increases. The increase in the mass of the black hole is related to the increase in its area by

[formula]

where M is the mass of the black hole and A is the area of its event horizon. In a thermodynamic system, the increase in entropy and energy are related by

[formula]

where dE is the increase in energy and dS is the increase in entropy. Equations ([\ref=e1],[\ref=e2],[\ref=e3]) suggest a relation between the entropy and area of a black hole as

[formula]

which leads to the Bekenstein-Hawking relation[\cite=key-1] [\cite=key-2]

[formula]

between entropy and area of a black hole. Although this relation was obtained using thermodynamic considerations, it was not possible to calculate the entropy of the black hole using statistical mechanics that relates the entropy with the micro-states of the black hole.

For a charged, non-rotating black hole of mass M and electric charge Q, the metric (which will be given in detail later) obtained by Reissner and Nordstrom [\cite=key-3] [\cite=key-4] as solution of Einstein's field equation in a spherically symmetric space is given by

[formula]

So, for the Reissner-Nordstrom metric gμν, the line element dτ is

[formula]

If r0 and r1 are the solutions of the quadratic equation

[formula]

so that [formula], we have

[formula]

The equation([\ref=eq:6]) can now be recast, in terms of r0 and r1, as

[formula]

where

[formula]

The event horizon is at r = r0 and we get the metrics

[formula]

So, the area of the black hole comes out to be [\citet=key-5] [\citet=key-6]

[formula]

The horizon with visible area is possible, i.e., A > 0, only if M > Q. On the other hand, for an extremal black hole, M = Q which corresponds to vanishing of the area, i.e., A = 0. So, the relation between entropy and area of a black hole given by equation([\ref=eq:4]) can never be obtained. This failure of the metric of equation([\ref=eq:6]) to reproduce the correct Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relationship([\ref=eq:4]) has prompted various attempts using D-branes[\citet=key-6] to reach out from higher dimensions to four and the concept of extended horizon[\citet=key-8]. Such attempts have been partially successful.

It is worth mentioning that in the metric components gtt and grr in equation([\ref=eq:5]), the term [formula] arises from gravitation and the term [formula] arises from electromagnetic interaction, both of which are at a weaker scale. It is natural to expect an additional contribution arising from strong interaction effects that would modify the Reissner- Nordstrom metric and give a term[formula]. Indeed this leads to the correct entropy-area relation for an extremal black hole.

In section-2 the metric tensor for a spherical symmetric gravitational field is obtained. The Reissner-Nordstrom metric for a charged black hole is obtained in section-3, where the effect of electromagnetic interaction is taken into acccount. The section-4 is devoted to the modification of the Reissner-Nordstrom metric by introduction of an additional term arising from strong interaction Regge physics. In section-5 the area of the extremal black hole is obtained using the modified metric. The entropy of the black hole is calculated in section-6 and section-7 is devoted to concluding remarks.

The metric tensor

As is well known, the metric tensor gμν(x) is related to the line element dτ by

[formula]

We give the details of the symmetry of the local geometrical object gμν(x) which is a symmetric covariant tensor. Let gμν(x) and [formula] be the original and the transformed components of  gμν(x) at the same point x of the spacetime manifold. For infinitesimal mappings of the manifold mapping group(MMG) [\citet=key-9], the symmetry implies

[formula]

where [formula]. The four vectors ξρ are the descriptors of the mapping and are the Killing vectors of the metric gμν(x). If gμν  =  ημν at all points of the manifold, where ημν is the Minkowski metric, equation([\ref=eq:14]) becomes

[formula]

The general solution of equation([\ref=eq:15]) can be written as

[formula]

Here ερ and [formula] are infinitesimal parameters. So, the symmetry group of the metric tensor gμνis the Poincare group.

The most general form of a spherically symmetric metric tensor gμν(x) is[\citet=key-9]

[formula]

where f1,  f2,  f3 and f4 are arbitrary functions of r and t. In a finite region of spacetime it is always possible to reduce the most general spherically symmetric gμν to a form[\citet=key-9]

[formula]

where a(r,t) and b(r,t) are functions of r and t.

With a point mass M located at the origin r = 0 and with xμ  =  {t,r,θ,φ} the spherically symmetric, static space-time can be represented by the metric of the general form [\citet=key-10]

[formula]

where ν and μ are functions of r and t.

The non-vanishing tetrad components of Riemann tensor are

[formula]

and

[formula]

The field equations follow by setting the various components of  Ricci tensor Rμν equal to zero. The equation

[formula]

implies that μ is independent of t and is a function of only r, i.e., μ  =  μ(r). Further, the equation

[formula]

gives

[formula]

so that

[formula]

where f(t) is independent of r and is an arbitrary function of time. By redefining time so that ef(t)dt is replaced by dt one can set f(t) equal to zero and hence

[formula]

Thus both ν and μ are independent of time and are functions of only r.

Further, the Einstein's equation

[formula]

gives

[formula]

or,

[formula]

or,

[formula]

or,

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Here, the constant M is the mass located at the origin r = 0. So,the metric is

[formula]

Thus, in a spherically symmetric, static universe equation([\ref=eq:19]) represents the metric tensor gμν for a black hole of mass M. This is the Schwarzschild metric.

Contribution from electromagnetic interaction

If the black hole is electrically charged, the metric gμν is modified due to inclusion of extra term involving the charge of the black hole. In the presence of electromagnetic field, the Einstein's field equation of general relativity gets modified. The Ricci tensor Rμν is no more equal to zero and has an electromagnetic source term,

[formula]

where Fμα is Maxwell's electromagnetic field tensor and ημν is the Minkowski metric. Because of spherical symmetry, the only non-zero component of the field strength tensor Fμα is [formula] So, in the Einstein's equation, instead of R22 = 0, we get [formula] when electromagnetic interaction is taken into account. Now,

[formula]

or,

[formula]

or,

[formula]

or,

[formula]

or,

[formula]

where the constant is - 2M. Using the value [formula], we get

[formula]

Thus, for a static, spherically symmetric charge distribution, with total charge Q, the solution of Einstein's field equation leads to the Reissner-Nordstrom metric[\citet=key-10]

[formula]

Unfortunately, this metric does not give the correct entropy-area relation for a charged, extremal black hole. The obvious reason is that the effect of strong interaction has not been taken into account, which would contribute a [formula] term to the metric coefficients as shown below.

Contribution from the strong interaction

In order to obtain the correct entropy-area relation for a charged, extremal black hole, we modify the Reissner- Nordstrom metric of equation([\ref=eq:20]) by introducing an additional term arising from strong interaction. From strong interaction Regge physics we know that for a black hole of mass M*

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] is the Regge slope. Here it is assumed that the mass M = M* of the black hole falls on the Regge trajectory or is very close to it.

In order to incorporate the effect of strong interaction, we consider the QCD Lagrangian[\citet=key-11]

[formula]

where Fμνα is the colour gauge covariant field strength tensor, Aμα is colour gauge vector potential, tα are the generators of the colour SU(3) group with [formula], n is the label for the quark flavour and g is the strong coupling constant. In order to investigate further, we note that a constant, background non-abelian gauge field [formula] cannot be removed by a gauge transformation.

For such a constant, static, background field, the field strength is[\citet=key-11]

[formula]

which has the gauge covariant derivative DλFδμν = CδεγCαβγAενAβμAλν. Here Cαβγ are the structure constants. The contribution of the constant, static background field can be inferred qualitatively from perturbation expansion so that we have a term with [formula] times the usual one with field AαβAβγAγμhaving the coefficient

[formula]

The non-linear terms arising from strong interaction give rise to additional contribution to the Reissner-Nordstrom metric as given below.

In the presence of both electromagnetic and strong interaction, the source term gets modified and the Ricci tensor R22 is now given by

[formula]

where M* is the mass of the black hole and [formula] from equation([\ref=eq:21]).

The solution given in equation([\ref=eq:31a]) now becomes

[formula]

or,

[formula]

The Reissner-Nordstrom metric of equation([\ref=eq:20]) now gets an extra [formula] term and the modified metric is given by

[formula]

The constant [formula] in equation([\ref=eq:33]) is determined from the condition that the black hole is to be extremal.

Area of the black hole

In order to find the area of the event horizon of the black hole, we need the metric coefficients gθθ and gφφ which, in turn, are obtained from the equation([\ref=eq:33]) by recasting it as folows.

We consider the cubic equation

[formula]

whose roots [formula] satisfy the relations

[formula]

Equation([\ref=eq:35]) has the solutions

[formula]

and

[formula]

The solutions([\ref=eq:36],[\ref=eq:37],[\ref=eq:38]) will be real only if [formula]. In order to calculate the event horizon, we must have at least

[formula]

For an extremal black hole, M = Q , and the condition given in equation([\ref=eq:39]) becomes

[formula]

In this case, it is important to note that the area A of the extremal black hole will no more be equal to zero.

For an extremal black hole, the solutions ([\ref=eq:36]), ([\ref=eq:37]) and ([\ref=eq:38]) become

[formula]

Substituting these in the relation [formula] of equation([\ref=eq:35]), we get

[formula]

The metric of equation([\ref=eq:33]) now becomes

[formula]

In terms of the solutions r0,  r1 and r2 the metric can be recast as

[formula]

where [formula]. So, the metric coefficients are

[formula]

From equation([\ref=eq:41]) we get the product

[formula]

which is needed to calculate the area of the black hole. Here, [formula] is the Regge slope. The area of the event horizon of the black hole comes out to be

[formula]

since [formula]

It may be noted that there is no multiplying factor like [formula](as in equation([\ref=eq:12]))which tends to zero for an extremal black hole.

For a closed string like object, there will be two equations like equation([\ref=eq:34]) with the last terms being [formula] and [formula]. So, [formula] will become

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. The area of the black hole becomes

[formula]

Entropy of the black hole

In order to calculate the entropy of the black hole we need the enumeration of the physical modes and have to take a 26 dimensional theory. In 26-D Nambu-Goto[\cite=key-12] [\cite=key-13] bosonic string, there are 24 physical bosons. Since the normal ordering constant for each boson is equal to [formula], the total normal ordering constant has the value a =  - 1. The total number of open string bosonic states dn, is described by the generating function

[formula]

The generating function is evaluated by using the elementary methods of quantum statistical mechanics, namely[\citet=key-14]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the classical partition function. For estimation of the asymptotic density of states, the behaviour of the function f(ω), as [formula], is to be known. This is achieved by using

[formula]

We can project out dn from [formula] by a contour integral along a small circle about the origin,

[formula]

For large n, we have a sharply defined saddle point for ω near ω = 1. One finds that[\citet=key-14], as n  →    ∞

[formula]

So, entropy of the extremal black hole, for open string, is

[formula]

From equations([\ref=eq:55]) and ([\ref=eq:45]), the relation between entropy and area of the extremal black hole, for open string, comes out to be

[formula]

This result was obtained for D = 26, where we have used 26 bosonic coordinates in our theory. We now proceed to evaluate the entropy of a black hole using a four dimensional theory, as we should. For this, we consider a 4-D bosonic superstring constructed by one of us (BBD)[\citet=key-15]. Here the four bosonic coordinates are added to the remaining twenty two, i.e., [formula] Majorana fermions that transform as Lorentz vectors - a bosonic representation of SO(3,1). This is an exact substitution in confirmity with Mandelstam's proof of the equivalence between fermions and bosons in the anomaly free 26 -D Nambu-Goto string[\citet=key-12] [\citet=key-13] and is an ingeneous way of introducing fermionic matter to the Nambu-Goto bosonic string.

In order to have supersymmetry, one should add both conformal and superconformal ghosts to the neutrino-like Majorana term of the theory[\citet=key-16]. Let the left handed and right handed neutrinos be described by the bare mass term in the most general gauge invariant Lagrangian as

[formula]

Now, using the identity [formula], one gets

[formula]

Here, M and B are N  ×  N matrices for N generations of fermions, and νL,  NR etc. are N element column vectors containing fields from any generation. The mass matrix is symmetric and upon diagonalisation of the mass terms, one gets 2N Majorana neutrinos. This can be seen by considering the simple case of one generation, i.e., N = 1. Here, the mass matrix is [formula], where M and B are simple numbers. Using the orthogonal matrix [formula] and the relation [formula], one can have

[formula]

Here m is the matrix with positive eigenvalues and K2 is a diagonal matrix of negative and positive signs. One finds that M  =  mK2O. Now using the column vectors [formula]   and   [formula], equation([\ref=eq:e1]) becomes

[formula]

Thus, the two eigenvalues obtained for a single generation are

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here R and N̂L are conjugates of νL and NR respectively. We thus get

[formula]

Both n1 and n2 are Majorana particles with [formula]

The action which we consider is[\citet=key-16]

[formula]

Here,Xμ is the bosonic field of the 26-D theory. The fermionic fields are [formula], with [formula] and [formula]

The value of the normal ordering constant a =  - 1, must remain unchanged in a superstring which is conformally and superconformally invariant. The number of bosons is to be calculated in such a way as to have the value of the normal ordering constant as a =  - 1. Out of the 44 fermionic modes, only 40 correspond to physical modes, because in all, there are six constraint equations - two constraints due to the vanishing of the energy momentum tensor, and four more constraints due to vanishing of the two species of currents due to the ψ and φ fermions in the action of equation([\ref=eq:56a]). The 40 fermions account for [formula] of the normal ordering constant and the remaining [formula] must be accounted for by four massless photon-like bosons. There are only two transverse coordinates, contributing [formula]. The longitudinal components which have been fermionised must be rebosonised. The reason is that the Majorana fermions φ's of the action([\ref=eq:56a]) in the last term having the phase freedom for creation operators satisfying the anticommutation relation

[formula]

has a negative sign instead of the usual positive sign and ghosts in the normal sense. These fermions account for two current constraints out of the total four. It is possible to bosonise the fermions which are propagating on a circle[\citet=key-13]. One of the two rebosonised bosons [formula] has the normal mode expansion for open strings

[formula]

and the Hamiltonian for one boson is

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula] just like the transverse bosonic modes of the string with normal ordering for one boson as [formula] Hence these must be counted as they are like the physical states of the larger of the two Fock spaces of the superconformal fields of the string theory in all aspects[\citet=key-17]. The normal ordering constant from these two rebosonised ones will be [formula], so that the value of the total comes out to a =  - 1.

The number of the physical fermionic level density is now

[formula]

since [formula] and [formula] are the quanta of the fermionic fields ψ and φ. Furthermore, the number of bosonic level density is

[formula]

Here [formula] are the two transverse modes and [formula] are the modes for the longitudinal bosons which had been fermionised and again rebosonised to account for the normal ordering constant for the entire enlarged Fock space. The above equality of both [formula] and [formula] to 4, thus ensures the supersymmetry of the physical states.

The degeneracy dn is now obtained from the generating function

[formula]

with ω = e- 2iπ / r. Here, as explained earlier, NB = NF = 4 and the ground state degeneracy is also equal to 4. Asymptotically, i.e., as [formula], we have

[formula]

which yields

[formula]

For a closed string, we have [formula] instead of [formula]. In this case, the level densities, again being statistical,

[formula]

The corresponding entropy is

[formula]

From equations([\ref=eq:58]) and ([\ref=eq:47]), we get the entropy-area relation for extremal black hole, for closed string, as

[formula]

Thus equations([\ref=eq:56]) and ([\ref=eq:59]) reproduce the exact Bekenstein-Hawking relation between entropy and area of black holes.

Conclusions

It is interesting to note that the modified metric for the black hole gets contribution of the [formula] term from gravitation, the [formula] term from electromagnetism and the additional [formula] term from strong interaction . Thus all the known interactions are encompassed by the black hole physics, specially in obtaining the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area law.

It is worth mentioning that, the previous attempts to obtain the area of extremal black holes in four dimensions having failed, one has to consider D-branes and extended solitons. The black holes are treated in higher dimensions rather than in four dimensions. Our present result, in four dimensions, dispenses with the need to go over to five dimensions and extended solitons. The correct entropy-area relation comes from the known concepts of general relativity and high energy physics.
