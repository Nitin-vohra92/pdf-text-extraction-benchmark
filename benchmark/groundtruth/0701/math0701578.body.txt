Combinatorial Dehn-Lickorish Twists and Framed Link Presentations of 3-Manifolds Revisited

Motivation

There exists a rather simple algorithm to go from a framed link inducing a space to a triangulation of the same space. This was first done in chapter 11 of [\cite=Kauffman_and_Lins_1994] via graph encoded 3-manifolds or gems. This algorithm was improved and incorporated to the computational system BLINK, in [\cite=LLins_2007]. Thus to get a blackboard framed link from a gem is a direct task. However, the contrary, given a gem to find by a polynomial algorithm a blackboard framed link inducing the same 3D-space is, as far as we know, an untouched problem in the literature. The reason why it is desirable to have such an algorithm stems from the fact that the quantum invariants are not computable from a triangulation based presentation of 3D-spaces. The two languages, triangulations and blackboard framed links have at present only a one way translation. This paper starts to fix the situation by providing a linear algorithm to prove the Lickorish-Wallace Theorem.

An overview of the Algorithm

Let T be a pseudo triangulation inducing a 3D-space M3. From it we construct the sequence

[formula]

The first passage is just the barycentric subdivision of T producing T  '. The barycentric subdivision of a 3-pseudo-complex have its 0-simplexes naturally colored by the dimensions it represents, namely, 0,1,2,3, so that each tetrahedron receives the four colors. Define the color of a face of a tetrahedron to be the color of its opposite vertex. The second passage is given by dualization. The 1-skeleton of the dual cell complex [formula] of T' is a graph G0 so that its vertices and edges are 0-cells and 1-cells of [formula]. The edges inherits the color of its dual triangular 2-face. This coloring of edges makes G0 into a gem and from this colored 1-skeleton we can recover T  ', whence M3, see [\cite=Lins_1995]. In the remaining passages we get gems G1, G2, G and G  ', all inducing M3. From gem G  ' we will get the gem J  ' inducing [formula] by very simple local moves named ji-twists, which maintains the number of vertices.

There is an operation on gems named k-dipole (k = 1,2) cancelation which together with its inverse the k-dipole creation is capable of linking any two gems inducing the same 3-manifold [\cite=Ferri_and_Gagliardi_1982], [\cite=Lins_and_Mulazzani_2006]. The cancelation of a dipole does not change the induced 3-manifold and decreases by two the number of vertices of a gem. Therefore in the passage G0  →  G1 we simplify the gem so that it has no k-dipoles, k = 1,2. A gem without 1-dipoles is called a crystallization. In the above sequence G1,G2,G are crystallizations. A 2-dipole cancelation or creation in a crystallization yields a crystallization.

The objective to be achieved in G2 and the passage G1  →  G2 become transparents in the language of thin gems [\cite=Carter_and_Lins_1999], here rebaptized knits. So, in this passage we start by switching from the gem language to the knit language, obtaining a knit N1 from G1. From N1 we produce a spiked cactus knit N2 having enough properties to meet our purposes. Then we switch back to the gem language by obtaining a gem G2 from N2. The passage G1  →  G2 is entirely obtained by 2-dipole creations. It increases the number of vertices, but as we shall see, |V(G2)|  <  6  |V(G1)|. The important aspect of the spiked cactus gem G2 (corresponding to a spiked cactus knit) is that a certain graph Gjk2, defined from it, is connected. At this point we fix a spanning tree X of Gjk2, |X| = p + 1. Each one of the p edges of X corresponds in G2 to a ji-pre-twistor. Again, all pertinent definitions are given in the next section.

To get the passage G2  →  G we start by replacing each edge of X which corresponds to a ji-pre-twist by an adequate number of parallel edges, each of which corresponding to a j-twistor. This can be done simply by creating special 2-dipoles, the so called double-8-moves. After these moves all the edges of X correspond in the dual [formula] of G to pairs of tetrahedra with an opposite pair of vertices in common, named a hinge. The interior of these pairs of tetrahedra are pairwise disjoint. The final passage G  →  G  ' is the localization of the hinges and produce truly pairwise disjoint solid tori. It is accomplished by a local complexifying move that replaces a pair of vertices by a fixed configuration of 34 vertices. See Figure [\ref=fig:localizingHinge]. In this work, as a consequence of the above passages, we prove the following Theorem:

There is an algorithm which obtains, given a pseudo-triangulation T with n tetrahedra, |T| = M3, a gem J  ', having O(n) vertices [formula], and a p-set of pairs of vertices [formula], [formula] [formula] of J  ' such that the ε-neighborhood of [formula] is a p-set of pairwise disjoint solid tori embedded in [formula]. Moreover, the ji-twists of the p k-twistors [formula] produce a gem G  ', |V(G  ')| = |V(J  ')| with |G  '| = M3. The framing of each component of the link induced by the collection of solid tori is the linking number of the two boundary component of a specific cylinder, the strip suvij, obtained from the ji-twist of the [formula]-th j-twistor.

This is a strengthening of the classical result of Wallace [\cite=Wallace_1960] and Lickorish [\cite=Lickorish_1962] and its proof relies on a linear algorithm. It opens the way for an algorithmic method for actually obtaining the link by an O(n2)-algorithm. This is the subject of a companion paper [\cite=Lins_and_Lins_2007] currently under preparation: it awaits a proper computer implementation.

Twistors, antipoles and their weaker versions

Let (i,j,k) be a permutation of the non-null of colors of a bipartite gem (1,2,3). An i-twistor in G is a pair of vertices of the same class of the bipartition {u,v} which are in the same 0i- and jk-gon, in distinct 0j-, ik-, 0k- and ij-gons. In the dual [formula] of the gem, an i-twistor becomes a pair of tetrahedra [formula] with an opposite pair of edges in common, namely the pair of edges corresponding to the 0i- and jk-gons containing both u and v. Such an structure is named an i-hinge. If u and v satisfy all the connectivity conditions but are in distinct class of the bipartition, then {u,v} is called an i-antipole. The ij-twist of an i-twistor is the operation of exchanging the i- and j-colored neighbors of u and v. A 3-residue in a gem is a connected component of a subgraph of G induced by three of the four colors. An ij-twist is an internal operation in the class of gems which does not change its number of 3-residues. We also have the following proposition.

For i,j∈{1,2,3},i  ≠  j, in dual terms of hinges an ij-twist of an i-twistor in a gem inducing M3 is a Dehn-Lickorish surgery in M3 [\cite=Stillwell_1980].

We refer to Figure [\ref=fig:twistorsInTheDual]. For a small ε denote Suvi and S'uvj the solid tori which are ε-neighborhoods of the hinges [formula] and [formula]. The two i-colored and two j-colored faces of the hinge [formula], is topologically a cylinder formed by four triangles which we call strip denoting it by [formula]. Let α be the closed curve in the boundary of Suvi which goes "just above" at an ε-distance of the medial curve of suvij. Let β be the boundary of a meridian curve in S  'uvj. The Dehn-Lickorish surgery is defined by attaching S  'uvj to the toroidal hole formed by the removal of Suvi in such a way as to identify the curves α and β. Indeed, the only data needed to perform the surgery is a projection of the curve α from M3 to a plane with the information of under and over passes. This projection becomes a blackboard framed knot and its framing is given by the linking number of the two components of the the strip suvij. This number can be computed from a general position projection of the strip in a plane (again keeping the information of under and over passes).

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=theo:mainTheorem] we need a weakening ot the concepts of twistors and antipoles. A ji-pre-twistor is a pair of vertices in the same class which are in the same 0j- and ik-gon and in distinct 0i- and jk-gons. If u and v satisfy these connectivity conditions but are in distinct classes, then the pair {u,v} is called a ji-pre-antipole. An i-pair in a bipartite gem G is a pair of vertices {u,v} which are either a ji-pre-twistor, a ki-pre-twistor, a ji-pre-antipole or a ki-pre-antipole. Given a gem G denote by Gjk the graph whose vertices are the jk-gons of G and the edges are the i-pairs of G. The ends of the edge corresponding to an i-pair {u,v} are the vertices corresponding to the jk-gons which contain u and v. In particular, Gjk may have parallel edges but not loops.

The only property that we need in the fourth passage, G1  →  G2 is to get by 2-dipole creations a crystallization G2 so that Gjk2 is connected. We state the following Conjecture. In it 94-clusters are the 4-clusters of in [\cite=Lins_1995], where is also defined a rigid gem: a crystallization whose 3-residues are 1-skeletons of polytopes. Loosely speaking a 94-cluster consist of a configuration of 9-vertices which has a central vertex incident to four square bigons. A 94-cluster implies a simplification: the 9 vertices become 7 without changing on the induced 3D-space. In a rigid gem each pre-twistor (resp. pre-antipole) is indeed a twistor (resp. an antipole).

If G is a rigid 3-gem without 94-clusters then Gjk is connected for every choice of distinct j and k in {1,2,3}.

Unfortunately we have been unable so far to prove this deep structural property of gems and so we were led to use the spiked cactus construction, which follows. This construction is needed only if Gjk1 is not connected, otherwise we take G2 = G1.

Knits and spiked cactus knits

We rename knit to be the object thin gem introduced for dimension 3 in [\cite=Lins_1997] and its generalization for dimension 4 given in [\cite=Carter_and_Lins_1999]. A knit is a plane bipartite graph with a perfect match of the sides of the edges. A j-knit N is a knit obtained from a gem G with edge colors 0,i,j,k as follows. Consider the 0-missing 3-residues of G embedded in the plane so that the exterior faces is an ik-gon. Choose a representative white vertex to be an interior point of each ij-gon and a representative black vertex to be an interior point of each jk-gon. The black and white vertices are the vertices of a bipartite graph N. Link a black vertex to a white vertex by a curve so as to cross G only once transversally in the interior of the k-colored edge of G which separates the ij-gon and the jk-gon corresponding to the vertices. These curves are the edges of N. Make the cyclic order of these linking edges emanating from any vertex of N to coincide with the cyclic edge of the dual j-colored edges in the corresponding ij-gon or jk-gon. Thus N becomes a graph embedded in the plane. The vertices of G are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the sides of the edges N. These sides are matched by the 0-colored edges of G and thus, N is a knit. A gem G is recoverable from its knit N: the angles of the knit are the i- and k-colored edges of the gem; the two sides of the edges of N become the j-colored edges of the gem. If G is a crystallization, N is connected.

A cactus j-knit is one formed by a tree-like arrangement of polygons and single edges. In a cactus j-knit every edge is incident to the external face (the only white face -- all the others in light gray). It is always possible to go from any knit N1 to a cactus knit N2' by means of a sequence of trivial angles creations. See the right part of Figure [\ref=fig:knit3torus]. Each such operation is the creation of a 2-dipole at the gem level. We need our knit N2 to have an extra property, namely, there should not be trivial angles at the black vertices (which correspond to the jk-gons of the associated gem.) This is not the case of the cactus knit of Figure [\ref=fig:knit3torus]. By extra trivial angle creations we get easily, in general, a cactus knit N2'' which meets the extra property.

To go from N2'' to our desired spiked cactus knit N2 we create two spikes (two pendant edges) "trisecting" each 0-edge. There are three cases on how this must be done and they are depicted on Figure [\ref=fig:spikes]. The creation of each spike is a 2-dipole creation in the gem language. In Figure [\ref=fig:spikes] the black vertices with a white spot correspond to black monovalent vertices corresponding, in the gem, to jk-gons with two vertices. In cases 1A and 1B we might without loss of generality suppose that by going around the boundary of the external face and in the clockwise direction the directed edge wx is at the left of the directed edge yz and that the vertices x and y are white (they might coincide). Otherwise, they are black and yz is at the left of wx and a and w are white (in the complementary circular path). Interchanging the labels of (w,y) and (x,z) we get the assumption holding. For case 2 there is no changing in the argument if left and right are interchanged. Here is the crucial property of spiked cactus knits.

Let N2 be a spiked cactus knit of a crystallization G2. Then every pair (u,v) of edge sides in N2 corresponding to a 0-colored edge (u,v) in G2 implies an edge of Gjk2 linking the vertices corresponding to the jk-gons containing the vertices u and v of G. As a consequence, since G2 is a crystallization, Gjk2 is connected.

The proof follows from the facts that {a,c},{b,d},{c,e},{d,f} are ji-pre-twistors in the first two cases of Figure [\ref=fig:spikes] and the same is true for {a,b},{b,c},{c,d} in the third case. The connectivity conditions making these pairs pre-twistors are easily checked in the knit language.

In consequence of Lemma [\ref=lem:connection], G2 induces a connected Gjk2. Suppose that |V(Gjk2)|=p+1 and let X be a subset of p edges of V(Gjk2) forming a spanning tree.

Pairwise disjoint solid tori corresponding to X

We turn back to the language of gems. The intial step in the passage G2  →  G is very simple. For each ji-pre-twistor in X which is not a j-twistor we fix the situation by creating two 2-dipoles near v (a double-8-move), as depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:twistorFromPreTwistor]. Note that after this move the vertices u and v are in distinct 0k-gons and ij-gons. Thus {u,v} becomes a j-twistor. A double-8-move replaces a twistor edge in G by three twistor edges in parallel. Recall that each edge in Gjk is labeled by a pair of vertices forming a pre-twistor or a pre-antipole. Actually the edges in X correspond to pre-twistors. By repeating enough double-8-moves at appropriate vertices we might suppose that in gem G the p edges of X have distinct 2p labels and that each pair of labels is a j-twistor.

From now on we refer to Figure [\ref=fig:localizingHinge]. In the passage G  →  G  ' we effect the process of localizing the hinges. This means that in [formula] the set of p pairs of tetrahedra corresponding to X are pairwise (entirely) disjoint. The passage G  →  G  ' is effected "at the spanning tree X of twistors" replacing each pair of vertices of each twistor by the configuration of 34 vertices depicted in the upper right part of the figure. The localization moves transform each twistor in X into a local object in the sense that any order to perform the twists in X produce only gems and arrive at gem J: the ji-twistor [formula] does not disturb the other j-twistors [formula], [formula]. This "2 by 34 replacement" is essential for our work. The detailed proof that G  ' simplifies to G by dipole cancelations is given in the Appendix.

Gem G  ' induces M3 and we prove that performing the ji-twists at the whole set X we get a gem J  ' which induces [formula]. We observe that to go from J  ' to G  ' we perform the inverse operation, namely, the ij-twist at X. It is rather easy to prove that gems J  '  ' and J (see Figure [\ref=fig:localizingHinge]) induce the same space: from J to J  '  ' we have four 2-dipole creations. From J  '  ' to J  ' we trisect (see Figure [\ref=fig:bigonTrisection]) the 0i-gon and the jk-gon incident to u and v. These moves are factorable as 1-dipoles and 2-dipole creations. Finally, it is straightforward to prove that J induces [formula] because it is a crystallization having a unique jk-gon: from G we can arrive to J directly by p ji-twists and each one of these decreases by one the number of jk-gons. In any crystallization the number of 0i-gons and of jk-gons coincide.
