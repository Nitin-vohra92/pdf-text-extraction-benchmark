Graceful exit from a stringy landscape via MSSM inflation

Introduction

We expect that the early universe, prior to inflation, existed in a state of high energy density, in particular, near the cut-off scale of the 4D effective field theory we know today. In string theory, this cut-off is typically expected to be near the fundamental string scale. Also, there is some evidence that string theory has a "landscape" of metastable vacua with varying cosmological constant, moduli VEVs (and therefore couplings), supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scale, and so on, which can be studied using statistical arguments (see [\cite=hep-th/0409207] [\cite=hep-th/0601053] [\cite=hep-th/0610102] for reviews).

Since many of these metastable vacua have large energy densities (as we describe below), it seems likely that the early universe could have existed as a de Sitter spacetime with a large cosmological constant, which then decayed by tunnelling, as in old inflation [\cite=Guth:1980zm]. In fact, such a cosmology with multiple stages of inflation [\cite=Burgess:2005sb] provides a mechanism by which the full landscape of vacua is populated, as in [\cite=Abbott:1984qf] [\cite=hep-th/0004134] [\cite=hep-th/0408133]. With some caveats, this mechanism can also relax the cosmological constant quickly [\cite=Abbott:1984qf] [\cite=hep-th/0004134] [\cite=hep-th/0408133] [\cite=hep-th/0611148] [\cite=hep-th/0612056]. In particular, the cosmological constant must be able to decay even though other sectors will dominate once the energy density reaches [formula].

One obvious worry about this picture is that, if the universe were to tunnel out of the false vacuum, then the universe would be devoid of any entropy as the nucleated bubble would keep expanding forever with a negative spatial curvature. Such a universe would have no place in a real world, so it is important that the last stage of inflation be driven by a slow roll phase that must explain:

The observed temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation and the subtle observational details [\cite=Spergel:2006hy]. This implies that the last tunnelling event must occur at least 60 e-foldings before the end of inflation.

Reheating into Standard Model (SM) like degrees of freedom, so that baryons and cold dark matter can be produced.

To solve the cosmological constant problem, the slow-roll phase must allow the population of vacua with smaller cosmological constants, which is facilitated by eternal inflation.

The first criterion has been addressed by [\cite=hep-th/0004134], and we will see that the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) can facilitate all the criteria.

Also, it was recently realized that MSSM has all the necessary ingredients for successful inflation, whose parameters can possibly be tested at the LHC [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006cx] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006ng]. Moreover, this inflation has a graceful exit which creates conditions for producing baryons and cold dark matter. The inflaton is a gauge invariant MSSM flat direction (for a review on MSSM flat directions, see [\cite=Enqvist:2003gh] [\cite=Dine:2003ax]). There are potentially two candidates, LLe and udd, where the superfield L stands for a SU(2)L lepton doublet, while e, ~ u, ~ d are superfields standing for the right-handed components of the electron and up and down type quarks. Both the inflaton candidates carry SM lepton and baryon numbers. After inflation, the inflaton decay directly creates baryons, leptons, and cold dark matter (the lightest superpartner is a candidate for cold dark matter [\cite=Jungman:1995df]). This decay addresses the second point above.

Inflation within the MSSM occurs near a saddle point of the flat direction potential, which is lifted by the soft SUSY breaking mass term, the non-renormalizable superpotential, a potential supergravity mass correction, and the A-term [\cite=Dine:1995uk] [\cite=Dine:1995kz]. All these contributions play important role. Although none of the individual terms would give rise to inflation [\cite=Jokinen:2004bp], all the terms combined provide a unique saddle point condition in gravity mediated SUSY breaking case [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006cx] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we] and in gauge mediated SUSY breaking case [\cite=Allahverdi:2006ng]. In these cases, the first nontrivial derivative of the inflaton potential is the third derivative, which alone determines the dynamics. This MSSM inflation matches the current WMAP observations with the right amplitude and the spectral tilt [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006wt] [\cite=BuenoSanchez:2006xk]. One important result is that the MSSM inflation produces many e-foldings of slow roll inflation, Ne  ~  103, with a preceding self-reproduction regime. Therefore, MSSM inflation can satisfy the first and third criteria above. One difficulty of MSSM inflation, though, is that it requires a 109 fine-tuning of the initial conditions for slow-roll (and 1013 for self-reproduction) and a 109 finetuning of the A-term [\cite=hep-ph/0610069] [\cite=hep-ph/0610134].

As we shall see, old inflation on the landscape and MSSM inflation complement each other nicely. The landscape picture suggests that the A-term fine-tuning is no longer a problem. Also, as in [\cite=hep-th/0004134], fluctuations of the MSSM inflaton during false vacuum inflation naturally fine tunes the initial conditions for MSSM inflation, i.e. why the MSSM inflation occurs near the saddle point of the potential [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we] [\cite=Lyth:2006ec]. On the flip side, MSSM inflation provides a period of eternal inflation followed by many e-foldings of slow-roll inflation, which allows tunnelling to solve the cosmological constant problem and further creates the necessary temperature anisotropies. Finally, MSSM inflation, by its nature, allows simple reheating into the SM sector.

We will begin our discussion with a broad brush-stroke review of the string landscape and the SM-like sector of it, first showing why we expect the landscape can accomplish fine-tuning of the A-term. Then we discuss the time scales associated with tunnelling events on the landscape, showing why eternal inflation seems necessary for the cosmological constant problem and why the arguments of [\cite=hep-th/0004134] require a slight extension. We will also show why we can assume the MSSM to be present throughout the chain of tunnelling events. Following our discussion of the MSSM in the landscape, we give a brief review of MSSM inflation. Then we explain how old inflation on the landscape can set the initial conditions for eternal inflation in the MSSM sector, using an improved form of the arguments of [\cite=hep-th/0004134]. In short, the MSSM flat directions, being light, obtain random quantum jumps, which displace them to large expectation values [\cite=hep-th/0503203]. Alternately, supergravity corrections to the MSSM can trap the flat directions in a false minimum (as in [\cite=hep-ph/9503259] [\cite=hep-ph/9503303] [\cite=hep-ph/9507453]).

Old Inflation on the Landscape

There are three main points we wish to make clear in our review of the landscape picture of string theory vacua. First, we wish to explain the current picture of landscape, including large (string scale) cosmological constants, especially reviewing the distribution of SM-like metastable vacua on the landscape. We will also review the scale of SUSY breaking and corrections to the MSSM Lagrangian due to the landscape sector and argue that the A-term can scan over the necessary range for MSSM inflation. Second, we will discuss tunnelling rates for the decay of each false vacuum, describing the phase of old inflation prior to MSSM inflation. With these rates in hand, we will see why the original solution of [\cite=hep-th/0004134] for the empty universe problem is not quite complete. Finally, we will see why eternal inflation is necessary for tunnelling on the landscape to solve the cosmological constant problem in a realistic cosmology.

Landscape with large Λ

The most basic fact about the landscape (which is usually not discussed, being of little interest for present-day physics) is that the cosmological constant is generically large. A simple way to see that follows [\cite=hep-th/0004134], which describes the landscape contribution to the cosmological constant as arising from string theory flux. In this picture, the vacuum energy

[formula]

where [formula] are constants and ni are flux quantum numbers (note that Λ has dimension [formula] in our notation as it enters the Einstein equation as Λgμν). It is clear that large Λ corresponds to a large radius shell in the space of flux quanta, so larger Λ will have more possible states. All in all, string theory (from the landscape point of view) could have from 10500 to even 101000 vacua [\cite=hep-th/0409207] [\cite=hep-th/0601053] [\cite=hep-th/0610102] [\cite=hep-th/0004134], with the vast majority of those having large cosmological constants.

In addition, our knowledge of the distribution of gauge groups over the landscape suggests that one out of 1010 vacua have the SM spectrum, at least in simple models [\cite=hep-th/0411173] [\cite=hep-th/0510170] [\cite=hep-th/0512190] [\cite=hep-th/0606109]. Even if this fraction is much smaller on the whole landscape, there are so many vacua that it seems likely very many will have a SM-like spectrum. For simplicity's sake, we will consider only this SM-like subset of the landscape in the rest of the paper, meaning we are ignoring possible transitions among vacua with different gauge groups in our cosmological model. We will justify this assumption in section [\ref=s:allpaths].

Given that the cosmological constant is large, at what scale is supersymmetry in the SM sector? We need to know this because we will want to follow the behavior of MSSM degrees of freedom throughout our cosmology, including time spent in vacua of large Λ, and we need to estimate corrections to the MSSM action. From statistical arguments (again, see [\cite=hep-th/0409207] [\cite=hep-th/0601053] [\cite=hep-th/0610102] for more references), most vacua should have badly broken supersymmetry, with large F-terms in the supersymmetry breaking sector. However, we assume that these F-terms are not in the SM sector, which can therefore be described as the MSSM (though perhaps with large soft breaking terms). In addition, there exist vacua with large cosmological constant that are "almost supersymmetric" in the sense of [\cite=hep-th/0601053]. These vacua have vanishing (or nearly vanishing) F-terms, and their cosmological constant and supersymmetry breaking are provided by a D-term, such as that created by an anti-brane. Upon decay of the D-term, the remaining vacuum has small Λ and low energy supersymmetry. The original model of [\cite=hep-th/0301240] is almost supersymmetric in this sense because anti-D3-branes provide both the cosmological constant and supersymmetry breaking. We can also consider the toy "friendly landscape" models of [\cite=hep-th/0501082], in which the dynamics of N scalars create a landscape of vacua. In the supersymmetric case,

[formula]

where Msb is the supersymmetry breaking scale of a hidden sector (not the N scalars) and the superpotential falls in the range

[formula]

with [formula] the cut-off.

In any of these cases, though, the scale of supersymmetry breaking in the MSSM sector is controlled in the early universe by the form of mediation. If supersymmetry breaking is gravity mediated, then the soft masses for the MSSM can be quite small m2  ~  M4sb / M2P, while the vacuum energy ranges over the landscape from zero (or potentially negative values) up to M4sb. Even the very non-supersymmetric vacua with large Λ might be viable for our purposes. Suppose that the MSSM feels supersymmetry breaking from both a landscape sector and a hidden sector (the hidden sector provides the present-day SUSY breaking), with gravity mediation from the landscape sector. At large Λ, we find that the corrections to the MSSM soft masses from the landscape factor are m  ~  Λ1 / 2  ~  H, so these corrections are the same as the Hubble corrections of [\cite=hep-ph/9503259] [\cite=hep-ph/9503303] [\cite=hep-ph/9507453]. We will consider these corrections explicitly below in section [\ref=s:mssminflate].

We also want to know whether we can expect the A parameter of the MSSM to vary over different values on the landscape in order to carry out the fine-tuning of one part in 109 necessary for MSSM inflation. As it turns out, the A term breaks a U(1) symmetry of the flat direction in the MSSM, so the landscape should scan values of A / MP (the appropriate dimensionless combination) around A = 0 in the sense of [\cite=hep-th/0501082]. In this case, we need a value of A  ~  10- 16MP with a tuning of δA / A  ~  10- 9, so we need at least 1025 MSSM vacua to achieve the right vacuum spacing. Given the large number of MSSM vacua that seem likely to exist, it seems a safe assumption that the landscape can accomplish the necessary tuning of A. Again, most of these SM-like or MSSM-like vacua will have large Λ, so it seems reasonable to think that a generic initial condition for cosmology is one of these large Λ vacua.

Decay time scales and inflation

The decay rate per volume (by tunnelling) of a metastable vacuum to the nearest neighboring vacuum takes the form

[formula]

where C is a one-loop determinant and ΔSE is the difference in Euclidean actions between the instanton and the background with larger cosmological constant. The determinant C can at most be [formula], simply because MP is the largest scale available, and estimates (ignoring metric fluctuations) give a value as small as C  ~  r- 4, with r the instanton bubble radius [\cite=hep-ph/9308280]. If we therefore look at a decay rate in a (comoving) Hubble volume, we find

[formula]

Especially with a large Hubble scale, the associated decay time is much longer than 1 / H, given that typically ΔSE  ≫  1.

In fact, as given in [\cite=hep-th/0305018] following [\cite=Coleman:1980aw] [\cite=Brown:1987dd] [\cite=Brown:1988kg], the Euclidean action takes the form

[formula]

where the bubble radius and effective tension τe are given in terms of dimensionless cosmological constants λ = M4PΛ  /  τ2, and the actual tension of the bubble wall τ. The full formulae are listed in the appendix.

Unfortunately, a given tunnelling process in the landscape probably has λ+  ~  1 and [formula]. However, it may be instructive to look at three limits, λ+  →  0,  ∞  . In the latter case, we simultaneously take λ-  →  0 or λ-  →  λ+ (these are the same for λ+  →  0). As λ+ vanishes, we find

[formula]

(The tension surprisingly drops out!) For λ+  →    ∞  , we find the limits

[formula]

The only parametrically different behavior is the last limit as λ±  →    ∞  , which means either that the tension is very small or that the cosmological constants are both very large (or that MP  →    ∞  , corresponding to field theory without gravity). Technically, the instanton approximation can break down in the limit ([\ref=step]), if the Euclidean action becomes much smaller than one (as a full quantum mechanical treatment would be necessary), but the important point is that [formula] if that is the case. From ([\ref=tunnel2]), we might expect that Γ / H  ≫  1, but we should remember that the coefficient of the exponential in ([\ref=tunnel2]) is an upper limit and that quantum mechanical effects could limit the decay rate to Γ  ~  H.

Therefore, we expect small jumps in Λ with small tension τ to be the most common decays, which can in fact be quite rapid. Recently, [\cite=hep-ph/0412145] [\cite=hep-ph/0502177] [\cite=hep-th/0612056] have argued that a series of decays in this last limit can give a novel form of inflation (dubbed "chain inflation") in which each metastable vacuum gives less than an e-folding, but which can overall have many e-foldings. In particular, in a large volume flux compactification model (ignoring warping) like those of [\cite=hep-th/0004134] there is a range of flux quanta such that ΔSE  ≪  1 (and Λ < M2P), so Γ / H  ~  1. In a warped flux compactification, the limit ([\ref=step]) can still apply, but, using the logic of [\cite=hep-th/0112197] [\cite=hep-th/0305018] [\cite=hep-th/0508139], the tunnelling rate is somewhat slower, but similar (see the appendix for details of these calculations). However, in the landscape, chain inflation does not have an a priori graceful exit [\cite=hep-th/0612056]; the argument of [\cite=hep-th/0004134] does not quite apply because it requires a large change in cosmological constant in the final decay before low-scale inflation (without inflaton trapping). In section [\ref=s:mssminflate], we give an improved form of the argument of [\cite=hep-th/0004134] that shows how old inflation on the landscape can source MSSM inflation without inflaton trapping and with only small jumps in the cosmological constant.

Note that, when MSSM inflation starts, the "bare" cosmological constant (that not associated with the MSSM inflaton) might still be considerably larger than the present value. This means that further instanton decays should take place to reduce the bare cosmological constant, and these decays should occur during MSSM inflation in order for the bubble regions to grow long enough. Since it seems likely that the instanton bubble tension will be large compared to the scale of MSSM inflation, the decay rate will be given by ([\ref=mink]), which is highly suppressed. This would then require MSSM inflation to last for extremely many e-foldings. Fortunately, MSSM inflation naturally includes a self-reproduction (eternal inflation) regime prior to slow-roll [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006cx] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we]. In other words, it seems that a low-scale eternal inflation is a necessary part of using decays to solve the cosmological constant problem, and MSSM inflation includes it naturally. Eternal inflation solves several of problems relating false vacuum inflation to observations, and it is particularly viable at the TeV scale of MSSM inflation [\cite=hep-th/9805167] [\cite=hep-th/0011262].

We have two more comments regarding additional types of transitions on the landscape. First, [\cite=hep-th/0611148] argues that resonance can play an important role in tunnelling across a landscape of many metastable vacua; we would not find qualitative differences in that case, but decays could occur more quickly. Second, we have discussed thin-wall instantons, as were first studied in [\cite=Coleman:1980aw] [\cite=Brown:1987dd] [\cite=Brown:1988kg]. However, in some cases of very large tension, so-called Hawking-Moss instantons [\cite=Hawking:1981fz] can dominate the decay rate. This typically occurs when the potential barrier separating two vacua is very wide, but, unless the barrier is also very shallow, the decay rate is approximately given by ([\ref=mink]). Because the potential barriers are typically expected to be quite tall on the landscape (up to string-scale energy densities), we will not treat Hawking-Moss instantons separately. Note also that there has been some recent discussion in the literature on the physical meaning of the Hawking-Moss instanton (e.g. [\cite=hep-th/0612083] [\cite=hep-th/0612146]), but we will not delve into those subtleties here.

Following all paths

As has been emphasized by [\cite=hep-th/0004134] [\cite=hep-th/0408133], the whole landscape, including the MSSM-like vacua, will be populated eventually almost independently of initial conditions due to repeated transitions among the different states on the landscape. In fact, if we ignore sinks in the landscape, eventually all the states will be populated with a fraction of the comoving volume given by a thermal distribution (see [\cite=hep-th/0701083] [\cite=hep-th/0605266] [\cite=hep-th/0611043] for a recent discussion including sinks).

What is important for us is that, because transitions are possible to states with higher cosmological constant, each bubble of a given state will contain bubbles of every other state. This fact means that any given path through the vacua of the landscape will be followed by some region of comoving volume. In particular, we can consider a history in which some patch of comoving coordinates enters a state with an MSSM sector with the appropriate tuning of the A-term at high cosmological constant and then proceeds to decay by reducing the cosmological constant without affecting the MSSM sector in any significant way. Therefore, we are justified in assuming that we can follow the behavior of MSSM fields and their actions throughout the process of old inflation on the landscape. Incidentally, these considerations are necessary for any application of the arguments of [\cite=hep-th/0004134] for the exit from old inflation; the low energy inflaton must exist in the states with larger cosmological constant.

MSSM inflation

Let us now discuss the what happens to the observable sector in the background of inflation spacetime. As we have noticed, the universe cascades from large cosmological constant to another somewhat smaller as time progresses. Given the decay time, it is fairly evident that huge number of e-foldings can be generated.

However, in order to have a sensible phenomenology, it is important that the last phase of inflation is primarily driven by MSSM-like vacua. Furthermore, it is equally pertinent that there exists a graceful exit of inflation within MSSM. This is possible provided there is no potential barrier in the MSSM like sector. Otherwise, the universe would nucleate in a cold state with a negative spatial curvature, because the bubble collision rate would not overcome the expansion rate [\cite=Guth:1980zm]. In this regard, slow roll inflation in the MSSM sector as discussed in [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006cx] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006ng] is ideal. We now ask how the dynamics of the MSSM flat direction will unfold during the era of false vacuum inflation.

During the false vacuum inflation the energy density of the universe, and hence the expansion rate [formula], remains constant for a given Λ. The flat direction potential receives corrections from soft SUSY breaking mass term, the non-renormalizable superpotential correction, W  ~  λΦn / Mn - 3P, where W is the superpotential, Φ denotes the flat direction and λn an O(1) coefficient, we also assume that the cut-off is given by the 4-dimensional Planck mass, and corrections due to the large Hubble expansion for a minimal choice of Kähler potential. These corrections, parameterized by two constants c  ~  O(1) and a  ~  O(1), result in [\cite=Dine:1995uk] [\cite=Dine:1995kz] [\cite=Enqvist:2003gh] [\cite=Dine:2003ax]

[formula]

where the soft SUSY breaking mass term is generically small compared to the Hubble expansion rate of the false vacuum, [formula]. We define [formula], and the dynamics of φ in an inflationary background depends on c and a. Therefore we consider different cases separately.

It turns out that the dynamics of the MSSM flat direction largely follow the physics discussed in [\cite=hep-th/0004134]. We review and elaborate on their discussion in the context of the MSSM and give an important improvement on their result in the context of negligible Hubble corrections.

Positive Hubble induced corrections

A positive Hubble induced correction provides c  ~    +  (1),a  ~  O(1). This is a typical scenario when the Kähler potential for the string modulus comes with a canonical kinetic term. Although this could be treated as a special point on the Kähler manifold, it is nevertheless important to discuss this situation. This is also the simplest scenario out of all possibilities. A generic flat direction gets a large mass of the order of Hubble expansion rate; therefore, its fluctuations are unable to displace the flat direction from its global minimum.

On phenomenological grounds, this is an uninteresting and undesirable case, since the bubble does not excite any of the MSSM fields. Therefore, the bubble remains empty and devoid of energy with no graceful exit of inflation from the false vacuum. The universe continues cascading to smaller Λ with smaller [formula]. Eventually, when [formula], the MSSM flat directions would be free to move. However, through this time the fields were never displaced from their minimum and therefore the dynamics of the flat directions would remain frozen. The universe would be cold, as it was before, and the spatial curvature would remain negative. It is fair to say that, on phenomenological grounds, such a universe is already ruled out. This paves the way for more interesting scenarios, which we discuss next.

Negligible Hubble induced corrections

In this case, the potential is not affected by the false vacuum inflation at all, namely |c|,|a|  ≪  1. So long as [formula], the flat direction field φ makes a quantum jump of length [formula] within each Hubble time. These jumps superpose in random walk fashion resulting in [\cite=hep-th/0503203]

[formula]

On the other hand, the classical slow roll due to the potential leads to

[formula]

For a massive scalar field V(φ)  ~  m2φφ2 / 2, the combined effects yield [\cite=hep-th/0503203]

[formula]

The maximum field value

[formula]

at which the slow roll motion ([\ref=slow]) counterbalances the random walk motion ([\ref=diff]), is reached for [formula]. This amounts to a number

[formula]

of e-foldings of inflation in the false vacuum.

In the absence of Hubble induced corrections, the potential in ([\ref=hubblepot]) has a saddle point at

[formula]

where [formula] while [formula], provided that A2 = 8(n - 1)m2φ. For [formula] TeV and λn  ~  O(1), and for n = 6, the VEV is φ0  ~  1014 - 1015 GeV. The suitable flat directions are LLe and udd, which are lifted by n = 6 superpotential terms and also have a non-zero A-term as required by the condition for a saddle point [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we].

For φ  <  φ0 the mass term dominates the flat direction potential. Then quantum fluctuations can push φ to the vicinity of φ0 if φr.m.s  ≥  φ0. This, according to ([\ref=rms]), requires that

[formula]

The number of e-foldings needed for this to happen is

[formula]

Indeed for [formula] the inherent uncertainty due to quantum fluctuations implies that φ  >  φ0 within one Hubble time.

A last stage of MSSM inflation with an expansion rate

[formula]

starts if V(φ) dominates the energy density of the universe, i.e. [formula]. An observationally consistent inflation in the slow roll regime requires that the displacement from the saddle point satisfy |φ  -  φ0|  <  Δφ, where [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we]

[formula]

In the landscape, the universe can begin in a false vacuum with arbitrarily large [formula] (as long as [formula]). Therefore, we generically expect that φ is quickly pushed to field values φ  ≫  φ0. However, [formula] slowly decreases as a result of tunnelling to vacua with smaller cosmological constant . For a massive scalar field with the potential V(φ)  ~  m2φφ2 / 2, this implies a gradual decrease of φr.m.s, see ([\ref=rms]). Since quantum fluctuations can at most push φ to φr.m.s, this also implies that φ is slowly decreasing in time. Indeed for [formula] GeV, we find that φ  <  φ0, irrespective of how large φ initially was. This is the case in the discussion of [\cite=hep-th/0004134], which is why [\cite=hep-th/0004134] requires a jump from large cosmological constant directly to the slow-roll inflationary stage.

Note, however, that the potential becomes very flat around φ0 as a result of the interplay among different terms in ([\ref=hubblepot]). In fact, for |φ  -  φ0|  ≪  φ0 we have [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we]

[formula]

Once [formula] GeV, φ reaches this plateau (from above). Within the plateau, [formula] becomes increasingly negligible, and so does the classical slow roll; they exactly vanish at φ  =  φ0. In consequence, quantum jumps dominate the dynamics and freely move φ throughout the plateau. Hence the flatness of potential, which is required for a successful MSSM inflation, guarantees that φ will remain within the plateau during the landscape evolutionary phase. It is possible to generalize this argument to other models of low-scale inflation; we see that a sufficiently flat inflaton potential can trap inflaton fluctuations in the slow-roll region.

The flat direction eventually dominates the energy density of the universe when [formula] GeV, see ([\ref=hinf]). MSSM inflation then starts in those parts of the universe which obey ([\ref=domain]). Having φ so close to φ0 is possible since the uncertainty due to quantum fluctuations is ~  1 GeV at this time.

The false vacuum inflation paves the way for an MSSM inflation inside the nucleated bubble. The modulus which was responsible for the false vacuum inflation continues tunnelling to minima with smaller (eventually the currently observed) cosmological constant inside the MSSM inflating bubble. The modulus will oscillate around the minimum of its potential as the curvature of its potential dominates over the Hubble expansion rate. The fate of oscillations would depend on the coupling of the modulus to the MSSM fields. For a coupling of gravitational strength, oscillations are long-lived. Moreover, the decay will be kinematically forbidden if the decay products are coupled to the flat direction φ (which has obtained a large VEV ≃φ0). However, such details are largely irrelevant as the flat direction dominates the energy density of the universe and drives inflation, diluting the energy density in oscillations.

In particular, we note that MSSM inflation has a self-reproducing regime [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we] because [formula] is extremely small and the potential becomes very flat close to φ0. The observable part of our universe can spend an arbitrarily long time in the self-reproducting regime before moving into the standard slow-roll inflation. During this period, the cosmological constant can continue to decay and eventually settle at an observationally acceptable value.

It is already known from [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we] that the flat direction generates a large number of e-foldings during slow roll inflation, i.e. Ne  ~  103, and during this phase the amplitude of the scalar perturbations and the spectral index are given by [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we]

[formula]

Here [formula] is the relevant number of e-foldings of inflation required to explain the current observations. For [formula] TeV, n = 6, φ0  ~  1014 - 1015 GeV, we obtain the correct amplitude of density perturbations and the scalar spectral index to be ns = 0.92 within 2σ of the current WMAP results. Actually, the value of [formula] depends on the thermal history of the Universe. In our case, the precise thermal history is known because the MSSM flat direction has SM couplings, and we know the maximum (see below) and the reheat temperatures [\cite=Allahverdi:2006wh] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006xh] [\cite=Allahverdi:2005fq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2005mz].

Slow roll inflation ends when the slow roll conditions are violated. Eventually, the flat direction starts oscillating around the origin with a frequency mφ  ~  1 TeV. The flat direction condensate dcays via instant preheating and creates a relativistic bath of MSSM quanta with a maximum temperature [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we]

[formula]

The temperature is sufficiently high to trigger electroweak baryogenesis within the MSSM and to provide the sufficient thermal condition for production of cold dark matter, i.e. the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP).

Before we conclude this discussion, let us remind the readers that obtaining the flat direction VEV, φ0, depends on the false vacuum inflation, which requires [formula] GeV at some time (see ([\ref=cond1])). This condition, although very probable in the landscape picture, need not be satisfied always. Then the quantum fluctuations would not be large enough to push the flat direction to the vicinity of φ0 as required for a final stage of MSSM inflation. This would therefore ruin the inflationary and phenomenological predictions. This can be avoided if the flat direction is trapped in a false minimum which evolves with time, as discussed below.

Negative Hubble induced corrections

The case with c  ~    -  O(1) may arise naturally for non-minimal Kähler potential [\cite=Dine:1995uk] [\cite=Dine:1995kz]. For [formula] the potential in ([\ref=hubblepot]) becomes tachyonic, and its true minimum is located at

[formula]

Note that [formula] is initially larger than φ0, see ([\ref=saddle]).

The curvature of the potential at the minimum is [formula]. This implies that φ is driven away from the origin, due to quantum fluctuations, and quickly settles down at [formula]. The MSSM flat direction is trapped inside the minimum, held due to false vacuum inflation, and gradually tracks the instantaneous value of [formula] as [formula] decreases.

The minima at φ  =  0 and [formula] become degenerate when [formula]. For [formula] the true minimum is at φ  =  0 and the one at [formula] will be false. The Hubble induced corrections are subdominant in this case. We then find [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we]

[formula]

The φ field can track down the instantaneous value of [formula] provided that [formula] is greater than the Hubble expansion rate. In fact this is the case so long as [formula] GeV, see ([\ref=falcurv]). Once [formula], the flat direction potential dominates the energy density of the universe, and MSSM inflation begins at a Hubble expansion rate [formula]. In the meantime, landscape tunnelling to vacua with smaller cosmological constant continues, and the location of the false minimum [formula] continuously changes. Eventually [formula] when

[formula]

at which time

[formula]

It turns out from ([\ref=hinf],[\ref=domain]) that [formula]. Therefore φ is already inside the interval required for a successful MSSM inflation. At this point the Hubble induced corrections become largely unimportant, and all the successes of MSSM inflation are retained, as discussed in the previous subsection. The fate of the string moduli inside the MSSM bubble remains the same as in the previous subsection. In particular, it does not matter whether the universe tunnels right away to the currently observed value of Λ or not. Inflation dilutes any excitations of the modulus oscillations during inflation. Our Hubble patch reheats when the MSSM flat direction rolls down to its minimum and starts creating MSSM quanta as discussed in the previous subsection.

Note that all needed for the success of this scenario is to start in a false vacuum in the landscape where [formula] TeV. This ensures that the flat direction will roll way from the origin and settle at [formula], which is the true minimum of V(φ) at that time. It will then track [formula] as [formula] slowly decreases, and will eventually land inside the appropriate interval around φ0. This is a much milder condition than that in the case of negligible Hubble induced corrections [formula] GeV (see the previous subsection).

One comment is in order. This scenario has some similarities to the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis with negative Hubble induced corrections [\cite=Dine:1995uk] [\cite=Dine:1995kz]. It can be seen from ([\ref=hubblepot]) that the equation of motion of the flat direction has a fixed point so long as Hubble induced corrections are dominant. The flat direction tracks the fixed point in a radiation or matter dominated universe. However, a non-adiabatic change in the potential occurs when H  ~  mφ, and the flat direction starts oscillating around the origin. However, in our case the universe is in a de Sitter phase with a slowly varying [formula], and the flat direction tracks the false minimum of its potential until it dominates the universe. As explained, this is necessary for having a successful MSSM inflation.

Conclusion and Discussion

In this paper, we have developed a modified version of "chain inflation" which has a graceful exit due to MSSM inflation. Multiple stages of false vacuum inflation relax the cosmological constant and provide the appropriate initial conditions for inflation driven by the MSSM flat direction [\cite=Allahverdi:2006iq] [\cite=Allahverdi:2006we] (as follows from an improved version of arguments from [\cite=hep-th/0004134]). This last stage inflates the universe to its current size and generates acceptable density perturbations which match the current observations. Furthermore, MSSM inflation will dilute any relics of string theory and has a neglible gravity wave background, so it has a clear prediction of standard inflationary CMB perturbations with no gravity waves, which is relevant for coming experiments. Without the initial stages of high energy false vacuum inflation, it would be very difficult to explain the initial conditions for MSSM inflation, and without the latter there would be no graceful exit from the false vacuum inflation. We find the complementarity of these two types of inflation to be intriguing.

Moreover, MSSM inflation produces a self-reproduction regime and many e-foldings of slow-roll inflation, which is important in solving the cosmological constant problem via tunnelling. As discussed in [\cite=hep-th/9805167] [\cite=hep-th/0011262], self-reproduction allows the cosmological constant to settle down to its present value long before the final 60 e-foldings of inflation, which allows for a standard CMB perturbation spectrum. Also, [\cite=hep-th/0011262] points out that TeV scale eternal inflation can fit observational constraints, even after tunnelling events in the context of string and M theory, which is another point of interest for MSSM inflation. In addition, self-reproduction is a virtue which is difficult to find among inflationary mechanism at scales below the string scale. For instance, brane--anti-brane inflation (for a recent review see [\cite=Cline:2006hu]) and multiple-axion-driven [\cite=Dimopoulos:2005ac] assisted inflation [\cite=Liddle:1998jc] [\cite=Copeland:1999cs] fail to provide large e-foldings of inflation without fine-tuning of the Lagrangian. On the other hand, "roulette inflation" [\cite=hep-th/0612197] and "racetrack inflation" [\cite=hep-th/0406230] [\cite=hep-th/0603129] can give rise to self-reproduction, and it would be interesting to study either of these models as a graceful exit from false vacuum inflation on the landscape and how false vacuum inflation can provide the proper initial conditions for those types of inflation.

Tunnelling formulae

For completeness, we list here the instanton bubble radius and effective tension:

[formula]

and

[formula]

We will also give the details of the decay rate calculation for the two examples of chain inflation listed in section [\ref=s:decaytime]. The first case, ignoring warping, was given in [\cite=hep-th/0612056], and we will recap here. For a perturbative large volume compactification with many fluxes, the cosmological constant is given by ([\ref=bp]) with the constants ci  ≪  1. We also take an isotropic compactification, so all the ci are approximately equal. Further, the brane charge q and Planck mass (we follow here the conventions of [\cite=hep-th/0612056] except that we take q  →  M2Pq) become

[formula]

The instanton bubble tension is then τ  ~  MP  /  α', so we find λ+  ~  M2Pα'cn2  ~  n2  ≫  1. Finally, the Euclidean action of the instanton is

[formula]

As long as c- 1 / 3  ≪  n  ≪  c- 1, ΔSE  ≪  1 and Λ+  ≪  M2P.

In the second case, we look at a compactification with a similar 5-brane instanton decay localized in a warped throat. This decay has been studied in [\cite=hep-th/0112197] [\cite=hep-th/0305018]. A perturbative [formula] large volume compactification [formula] (with eu the linear scale of the (unwarped) compactification manifold) has a Newton constant

[formula]

(Here, we follow the conventions of [\cite=hep-th/0305018], in which the VEVs of u and gs are scaled out of the Einstein frame metric.) It is possible to see that the instanton bubble tension is dominated by a term

[formula]

where z is the complex structure modulus of the warped throat. This modulus is related to the minimum warp factor of the throat in such a way that

[formula]

where M is a flux quantum number and [formula] and [formula] is the warped string length at the bottom of the throat.

Now let us imagine that this decay does not annihilate most of the cosmological constant. Then [\cite=hep-th/0508139] argues that [formula]. This immediately implies that [formula] and ΔSE  ~  1. (We know that λ-  ~  λ+ because the energy density localized in the warped region is [formula].)
