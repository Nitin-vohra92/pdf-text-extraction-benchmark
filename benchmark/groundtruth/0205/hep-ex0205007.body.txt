Abstract

We present preliminary results on hadronic decays of B mesons, based on data recorded at the resonance with the   detector at the PEP-II B-factory at SLAC. We measure branching fractions of many B decay modes, including decays to [formula], [formula] and [formula] final states. We report the observation of the decay [formula] and the first measurement of the flavor-tagged D meson production in B0 decays. Since their preliminary nature, the results presented in this paper are based on different data samples.

The   detector

The   detector [\cite=NIMbab] at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy B-factory [\cite=PEPII] at SLAC consists of a silicon vertex tracker (SVT) for precise decay vertex determination, a 40-layer drift chamber (DCH) for momentum and track angles measurement, a detector of internally reflected Cherenkov radiation (DIRC) for charged hadron identification, and a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) for photon reconstruction and electron identification. A superconducting solenoid provides a magnetic field of 1.5 T, and the iron of the flux return is instrumented with resistive plate chambers (IFR) to provide muon identification and neutral hadron reconstruction.

Hadronic B decays to charmonium

Color suppressed transitions [formula] are responsible for hadronic B decays to final states containing a charmonium. Theoretical predictions are based on the factorization hypothesis, that can be accurately tested with extensive and precise branching fraction determinations [\cite=jpsiPRD].

Rare B decays to states with a [formula]

The Cabibbo-suppressed decays [formula] are described by a [formula] transition, as the observed decay [formula]. An upper limit on the decay [formula] has been set by the L3 Collaboration [\cite=L3ref], while there is no published result for the [formula] channel.

The decay [formula] is described by a [formula] transition, in which the ss̄ pair is produced from sea quarks or via gluon emission. This mode has been observed by the CLEO Collaboration [\cite=CLEOphiK] with a branching fraction of [formula].

The decay [formula], which has not yet been observed, is explained with the occurrence of cd rescattering into a css̄ state.

The above decay modes have been studied at . The η is reconstructed in γγ or [formula] final states and the [formula] in the [formula] channel. The φ is reconstructed in the K+K- final state. Table [\ref=tab:rarejpsi] shows the preliminary results  obtained from the analysis of 50.9 fb- 1 of data recorded at the resonance [\cite=BABrare].

Measurement of [formula]

In the decay [formula], the [formula] pair comes from the [formula] channel or can be produced in a non-resonant state. The [formula] mode is useful for the measurement of [formula] and possible interference with higher order diagrams could produce a sizeble deviation of the branching fraction from the tree level expectation. An upper limit on this decay has been set by the CLEO Collaboration [\cite=CLEOpipi].

At , the decay [formula] is exclusively reconstructed and the signal yield is extracted from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the [formula] invariant mass of the selected candidates [\cite=BABpipi]. The preliminary result obtained from a sample of 51.7 fb- 1 of data recorded at the resonance is [formula].

Measurement of [formula]

The decay [formula] can be used for a theoretically clean determination of [formula], in the same way as the "golden" mode [formula]. Previous studies of the neutral and charged decay modes were performed by the CLEO Collaboration [\cite=CLEOetack].

At , the decay [formula] is exclusively reconstructed, with the [formula] decaying in KSK±π±, [formula] or K+K-K+K- final states [\cite=BABetack]. The preliminary results obtained from a data sample of 20.7 fb- 1 recorded at the resonance are [formula] and [formula], where the third error contribution is due to the uncertainty on the value of [formula], as reported in the PDG [\cite=PDG].

Observation of [formula]

One of the methods to determine the angle γ of the unitarity triangle [\cite=BABphyboo] is the measurement of sin (2β  +  γ) from the time dependent CP-asymmetry of the decay [formula] [\cite=Duni]. The asymmetry evolution depends on the parameter [formula] which can be determined from the branching fraction measurement of [formula] through the relation:

[formula]

The above equation is valid in the limit of the tree diagram dominance for [formula] and D+π- modes.

At , the decay [formula] is exclusively reconstructed, with the [formula] decaying in φπ+, [formula] or KSK+ final states. From the analysis of a data sample of 56.4 fb- 1 recorded at the resonance, the number of observed signal events is NDsπ  =  14.9  ±  4.1 with a statistical significance of 3.5σ. The preliminary branching fraction is [formula]. Using the value of [formula] in the PDG, which has a 25% uncertainty, a branching fraction [formula] is obtained.

D meson production in B0 decays

Inclusive branching fractions of charged and neutral B mesons to charmed hadrons will help to solve the longstanding nc puzzle [\cite=yamamoto]: the mean number of charm quarks per B decay obtained from direct counting does not agree with theoretical estimates based on branching fraction measurements of semileptonic decays.

The analysis of D meson production in B0 decays at   is based on the exclusive reconstruction of one B meson coming from the decay of the ([formula]) in a semileptonic ([formula], with l = e,μ) or hadronic mode ([formula], [formula], [formula]). The recoil system is then analyzed to search for a neutral (charged) D in the [formula] ([formula]) channel. The inclusive branching fractions [formula] and [formula] are determined from a fit to the invariant mass distribution of the selected D candidates.

In the inclusive decays [formula] and [formula] the charm quark comes directly from the decaying b quark, and the D meson is said to be of "right-sign". On the contrary, the D meson in the inclusive decays [formula] and [formula] is said to be of "wrong-sign". The fraction w of decays with a "wrong-sign" D is determined by comparing the flavor of the B0reco with that of the D, after correcting for the B mixing probability χd:

[formula]

If Δt is the time difference between the decays of the two B mesons, events with |Δt|  >  2.5ps are discarded. Indeed, they do not contribute significantly to w measurement because χd(|Δt|  >  2.5ps)  =  1 / 2. The requirement on |Δt| increases the sensitivity to w, thereby improving the statistical error. It improves also the systematic error since the reduced contribution from the B mixing.

Preliminary measurements of [formula] and [formula] are based on a sample of 30.4 fb- 1, while the fractions w are determined from a sample of 51.1 fb- 1, all recorded at the resonance. These determinations are combined to obtain the first measurements of flavor tagged D0 and D± production in B0 decays. Preliminary results are shown in Table [\ref=tab:inclBtoD]. They agree with existing measurements of flavor tagged D meson production in a environment. The flavor of the spectator quark in the parent B appears to have a negligible effect in the production of "wrong-sign" D mesons. The increase in the central value of the measured branching fractions goes in the direction of a better agreement with theoretical predictions. However, in order to solve the nc puzzle other inclusive branching fraction measurements are needed.
