Even powers of divisors and elliptic zeta values

Dedicated to Igor Frenkel on the occasion of his [formula] birthday

Introduction

Let k be a positive integer. The generating function of the sum of k   -   1st powers of divisors of positive integers

[formula]

converges in |q| < 1. If k - 1 is odd, it has interesting transformation properties under the modular group [formula]. Indeed, it is closely related to the Eisenstein series

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where [formula] is the Riemann zeta function. For k  ≥  4, these functions are modular forms of weight k:

[formula]

See [\cite=Serre] for proofs of these facts, but notice that there Gk denotes in our notation G2k / 2. As Gk( - 1 / τ) = τkGk(τ), it follows that, if k is even,

[formula]

In other words, we may regard τkDk(e2πiτ) as a one-parameter deformation of the zeta value ζ(k), and this is also true if k is odd. For odd k, however, Dk(q) does not have obvious modular properties. The purpose of this note is to show that Dk(q) can be embedded into a two-parameter deformation of ζ(k), the elliptic zeta value at k, which obeys identities of modular type. These identities are essentially equivalent to modularity in the even case but are of a different nature in the odd case. They are related to (and a consequence of) the three term relations of the elliptic gamma function [\cite=FV].

Differences of modular forms

Let H be the upper half-plane [formula].

Let k be an even positive integer. Suppose Z(τ,σ) is a holomorphic function on H  ×  H admitting an expansion

[formula]

and obeying Z(τ,σ) =  - Z(σ,τ). Then the following statements are equivalent:

Z(τ,σ) = G(τ) - G(σ) for some modular form G of weight k.

Z obeys the three-term relations

[formula]

for all σ,τ∈H such that σ  /  τ∈H.

Proof: It is easy to check that if G is a modular form then G(τ) - G(σ) obeys the three-term relations. Conversely, let us extend an,m to all integers n,m by setting an,m = 0 if n or m is negative. The first three-term relation implies that an - m,m + an,m - n = an,m. It follows that an,m = an - m,m if n > m and an,m = an,m - n if m > n. By the Euclidean algorithm we see that for n,m > 0, an,m = aN,N, where N = (n,m) is the greatest common divisor. But aN,N = 0 since Z is odd under interchange of q and r. Thus only an,0 = a0,m may be non-zero and Z(τ,σ) = g(τ) - g(σ) with [formula] In particular, g(τ + 1) = g(τ). The second three-term relation can then be written as h(τ) = h(σ) - h(σ  /  τ)τ- k, where h(τ) = g(τ) - τ- kg( - 1 / τ) is holomorphic on the upper half plane. If we take the second partial derivative of this identity with respect to τ and σ, we obtain zh''(z) + (k + 1)h'(z) = 0, with z = σ  /  τ. Thus h' is homogeneous of degree - k - 1 and h(z) = aτ- k + b for some a, b. Inserting back in the identity for h shows that b =  - a. Then G(τ) = g(τ) + a obeys G(τ + 1) = G(τ) and G( - 1 / τ) = τkG(τ) and is thus a modular form of weight k. [formula]

Elliptic zeta values

We now define two-parameter deformations of the values of the zeta function at positive integers, which we call elliptic zeta values:

[formula]

Clearly, Zk(τ,σ) =  - ( - 1)kZk(σ,τ). The relation to the functions Dk is obtained by expanding the elliptic zeta values in a power series in q and r. The result is the following.

If k is even, then

[formula]

If k is odd, then

[formula]

The sum is over pairs of relatively prime pairs of positive integers a,b.

Let [formula]. Then Zk obeys the three-term relations

[formula]

for all σ,τ∈H such that σ  /  τ∈H.

lim σ  →  0 lim τ  →  i  ∞σkZk(τ,σ)  =  ζ(k) if [formula].

For k = 1, lim σ  →  0 lim τ  →  i  ∞(σZ1(τ,σ) +  ln ( - 2πiσ)) is the Euler constant [formula] (the logarithm is real if σ is imaginary).

In particular, by taking the limit of Zk as τ  →  i  ∞   we obtain

[formula]

We prove Theorem [\ref=t-1] in the next section.

Remark on [formula]. The three-term relations in Theorem [\ref=t-1] have an interpretation as [formula] 1-cocycle properties parallel to the ones discussed in [\cite=FV] for the elliptic gamma function. We only sketch the construction here as the details are the same as in the case of the elliptic gamma function [\cite=FV]. First of all, one notices that the three-term relations, the symmetry k(τ,σ) =  - ( - 1)kZk(σ,τ) and the periodicity Zk(τ + 1,σ) = Zk(τ,σ) continue to hold if we extend the domain of Zk to [formula], [formula], by setting Zk( - τ,σ) = Zk(τ, - σ) = ( - 1)kZk(τ,σ). We pass to homogeneous coordinates and set k(x1,x2,x3) = x- k3Zk(x1 / x3,x2 / x3). This function is homogeneous of degree - k and holomorphic on the dense open set of [formula] defined by the conditions [formula] (i = 1,2). Our identities relate values of k at points related by the [formula]-action on [formula]: if k  ≥  4,

[formula]

Let eij (i  ≠  j) be the elementary matrices in [formula], with 1 in the diagonal and at the position (i,j), and zero elsewhere. These matrices generate [formula]. A consequence of the identities is that if we set

[formula]

([formula]) then φ extends (uniquely) to a 1-cocycle [formula] of [formula] with values the space of holomorphic function with open dense domain in [formula], i.e., one has φgh(x) = φg(x) + φh(g- 1x) for all [formula] and x in a dense open set.

The elliptic gamma function

Theorem [\ref=t-1] follows from the results of [\cite=FV] where the properties of modular type for Ruijsenaars's elliptic gamma function [\cite=R] were discovered. In the normalization of [\cite=FV], the elliptic gamma function is defined by the double infinite product

[formula]

It obeys the functional relation Γ(z + σ,τ,σ)  =  θ0(z,τ)Γ(z,τ,σ), which is an elliptic version of Euler's functional equation for the gamma function. Here θ0 denotes the modified theta function

[formula]

The Euler gamma function Γ(z) is recovered in the limit

[formula]

([\cite=FV], p. 54) Suppose τ,σ,σ  /  τ∈H. Then

[formula]

for some polynomial Q(z;τ,σ) of degree three in z with coefficients in [formula].

It follows from the Weierstrass product representation [formula] that the values of ζ at positive integers are essentially Taylor coefficients at 1 of the logarithm of the Euler gamma function:

[formula]

Here [formula] is the Euler constant. The elliptic analog of this formula involves the elliptic zeta values:

[formula]

This formula, with Zj defined by eq. [\eqref=e-EZV], is an easy consequence of the summation formula for ln   Γ(z,τ,σ) ([\cite=FV] p. 51):

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t-1]: The first claim of the theorem is proved by taking the logarithm of the identities of Theorem [\ref=t-2] and expanding them in powers of z - σ.

Taking the limit of [\eqref=e-logEG], by using [\eqref=e-SCL] to compare it with [\eqref=e-logG] implies (ii).

In the same way we can deduce (iii). However, if n = 1, we have to take into account the factor θ1 - z0 in [\eqref=e-SCL]: we obtain γ  =   lim σ  →  0 lim τ  →    ∞(σZ1(τ,σ) +  ln θ0(σ,τ)). Since ln θ0(σ,τ) =  ln ( - 2πiσ) plus terms that vanish in the limit, the proof is complete. [formula]

By using the explicit formula for the polynomial Q (see [\cite=FV]), we also obtain the exceptional relations for k = 1,2,3:

Let [formula] and suppose τ,σ,σ  /  τ∈H. Then

A direct proof of the three-term relations of Theorem [\ref=t-1]

We thank Don Zagier for providing the following alternative direct proof of the three term relations of Theorem [\ref=t-1], which does not use the elliptic gamma function. As the case where k is even follows easily from the modular properties of the Eisenstein series, it is sufficient to consider the case where k is odd. The proof is based on an alternative formula for Zk(τ,σ) for k  ≥  5 odd, which could be seen as a more natural definition of the elliptic odd zeta values. Let ε(n) be the sign of n (ε(n) = 1,0, - 1 if n > 0, n = 0, n < 0 respectively) and set [formula]. Then

[formula]

where [formula] means a sum over all (a,b,c)  ≠  (0,0,0). To deduce this formula, rewrite [\eqref=e-EZV] as

[formula]

then use the Lipschitz formula [formula], (ρ∈H, [formula]).

By using [\eqref=e-alt] it is easy to prove Theorem [\ref=t-1] (i): the three term relations follow from the obvious identities ε(a - b,b) + ε(a,b - a) = ε(a,b), ε(a,b) = ε( - c,b) + ε(a,c).

It should be possible to prove also the identities in the exceptional cases where k = 1,3 using this method, but suitable summation procedures should be applied to make sense of the series [\eqref=e-alt], which are not absolutely convergent.
