Generating functions for moments of the quasi-nilpotent DT-operator

Introduction

In combinatorics, one of the most useful methods for studying a sequence is to give its generating functions. The two most common types of generating functions are ordinary generating functions [formula], and exponential generating functions [formula]. In this paper we study the *  -moment generating functions -- a family of multivariable power series Fn-- of a particular operator T that arose in the theory of free probability. We prove that Fn's are all rational by applying a linear transformation between these two types of generating functions.

The central object of this paper is the collection of *  -moments of a particular bounded operator T on Hilbert space, which was constructed in [\cite=DH] and which is a candidate for an operator without a nontrivial hyperinvariant subspace. (A hyperinvariant subspace of an operator T on a Hilbert space [formula] is a closed subspace [formula] that is invariant under every operator S that commutes with T, i.e. [formula]. It is an open problem whether every operator on Hilbert space that is not a multiple of the identity has a nontrivial hyperinvariant subspace.) The von Neumann algebra generated by T has a unique normalized trace τ, and by the *  -moments of T we mean the values

[formula]

with [formula], [formula]. These *  -moments determine a representation of T on a Hilbert space, (which can be shown to be bounded, see [\cite=DH]), via the construction of Gelfand, Naimark and Segal, (cf. [\cite=KR]) and hence they encode all essential properties of the operator. Our effort to understand the *  -moments is part of an attempt better to understand the operator T.

To be precise, T is a [formula]-operator, in the class of DT-operators constructed in [\cite=DH]. T can be realized as the limit in *  -moments of strictly upper triangular random matrices having i.i.d. complex gaussian entries. In [\cite=DH], it was proved that T is quasi-nilpotent, i.e. has spectrum {0}. It was shown that [formula] if [formula], and also a recursion formula for M was proved (cf. [\cite=DH]). It was conjectured in [\cite=DH] that

[formula]

In this paper, we will consider the quantities

[formula]

(which must be nonnegative integers by [\cite=DH]), and their generating functions

[formula]

We will prove a recursion formula for the functions Fn, involving an operation [formula] on power series, which can be decsribed as multiplication with reweighting of homogeneous parts. In order to compute these generating functions, we will define a linear transformation of formal power series, called the [formula]-transform, which maps these power series to exponential generating functions of a new variable q, and converts the operation [formula] to the usual multiplication. This will allow us to prove that Fn is a rational function for all n, and to give an algorithm for computing Fn.

In §[\ref=sec:fps], the operation [formula] and the transform [formula] on formal power series are introduced, and several properties are proved. In §[\ref=sec:genfun], recursion formulas for [formula] and for the generating functions Fn are proved. The latter are shown to be rational and several examples are computed. In §[\ref=sec:ci], we use the method of contour integration to verify the conjecture [\eqref=eq:conj] in the case n = 2.

Formal power series

In this section, fix variables [formula] and fix [formula]. (In the next section we will use only the case N = 2.) Let Θ  =  ΘN be the algebra of all formal power series in [formula] of the form

[formula]

for some [formula], and such that [formula] whenever [formula] is not divisible by N. Given a formal power series as in [\eqref=eq:fps] and given [formula], write f(k) for its Nk-homogeneous part:

[formula]

Note that [formula] is bilinear, commutative and associative. If fi∈Θ ([formula]) then

[formula]

Let [formula] be the set of all formal power series in variables [formula] and the additional variable q.

Note that [formula] is linear.

If f,g∈Θ then [formula].

If f∈Θ and if a∈Θ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree N then [formula], i.e.

[formula]

If [formula] and if [formula] are distinct homogeneous polynomials of degree N, then

[formula]

which in the case r = 1 means [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula]. If [formula] are homogeneous polynomials of degree N with [formula] distinct, then

[formula]

For ([\ref=enum:fdtg]),

[formula]

For ([\ref=enum:af]),

[formula]

For ([\ref=enum:1u]),

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

Hence it will suffice to show

[formula]

for all [formula]. We will proceed by induction on r, treating [formula] in [\eqref=eq:sumutoshow] as any n distinct elements in a field. The case r = 1 is clear. If r = 2, then we have

[formula]

as required. Assume [formula]. Using the induction hypothesis, we have

[formula]

We must show

[formula]

or, equivalently,

[formula]

Using the Vandermonde determinant

[formula]

and expanding the determinant

[formula]

along the first row, we find the latter is equal to the LHS of [\eqref=eq:vddtoshow], but is also clearly equal to zero.

To prove ([\ref=enum:a1u]), use ([\ref=enum:1u]) and iterate ([\ref=enum:af]).

If one knows that [formula] is in the image of [formula], then to find [formula], simply replace every occurrence of qk by k!. This can sometimes be used to compute [formula].

We now turn to some cases of [formula] which will be used in §[\ref=sec:genfun].

If [formula], [formula] and if [formula] are homogeneous polynomials of degree N such that [formula] are distinct, then

[formula]

Using Proposition [\ref=prop:basic], we have

[formula]

Let [formula] and let [formula], [formula]. Let [formula] be homogeneous polynomials of degree N such that (ui + vj)1  ≤  i  ≤  m,  1  ≤  j  ≤  n is a family of mn distinct polynomials. Then

[formula]

where [formula] is a polynomial in the variables (ui)m1 and (vj)n1, having degree bounded above by [formula].

Using Proposition [\ref=prop:basic] and Remark [\ref=rem:E-1], we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the polynomial

[formula]

We will show that for every 1  ≤  a < b  ≤  m, ua - ub divides Q. It will suffice to show that substituting ua = x and ub = x into the RHS of equation [\eqref=eq:Q] yields zero. This substitution makes all terms of the sum zero except possibly when i∈{a,b}. These remaining terms are equal to the common factor

[formula]

times the quantity

[formula]

However, since a < b, we see that the quantity [\eqref=eq:pq] is equal to

[formula]

By symmetry, we have that vc - vd divides the polynomial Q, for every 1  ≤  c < d  ≤  n. Thus

[formula]

is a polynomial in [formula]. The upper bound on its degree is easily computed from [\eqref=eq:PQover] and the expression [\eqref=eq:Q].

Proposition [\ref=prop:11v] shows Pk,0m,1 = (1 - v1)m - k - 1 and [formula]. Here are some other examples.

[formula]

Generating functions

We will now define [formula], but extending the definition found in the introduction to allow [formula] to be - 1. The reason for this extension is to allow a recursion formula to be proved for [formula] that holds for all [formula].

The following is immediate from [\cite=DH].

[formula].

[formula].

If [formula], if [formula] and if k1 = 0, then

[formula]

If [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

where [formula] is the multinomial coefficient

[formula]

If [formula] then both sides of the equality are zero. So suppose [formula]. If [formula] then the equality follows directly from the recursion formula [\cite=DH]. To verify the equality [\eqref=eq:recur] in general, we will proceed by induction on n. Let [formula] be the RHS of [\eqref=eq:recur]. In the case n = 1, we need only check that N'(0,0) = 1, which is clear. Assume [formula]. Writing [formula] on a circle, it is clear that both sides of equation [\eqref=eq:recur] are invariant under the following permutation of order n:

[formula]

Therefore, it will be enough to consider three cases: (i) k1 = 0, [formula], (ii) [formula], [formula], (iii) [formula].

In case (i), all terms in the sum [\eqref=eq:recur] having j(1) = 1 are zero. If [formula], then using Proposition [\ref=prop:Nprop] we have

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

where the second equality is by the induction hypothesis and the third is from Proposition [\ref=prop:Nprop].

In case (ii), ([formula], [formula]), one similarly shows

[formula]

In case (iii), ([formula]), given 1  ≤  r  ≤  n and [formula], let [formula] be the corresponding term in the sum [\eqref=eq:recur] for [formula], and, if j(r) < n, let [formula] be the term corresponding to [formula] in the analogous sum for [formula]. If j(1) > 1 and j(r) < n, then using Proposition [\ref=prop:Nprop] we have

[formula]

which, taken in the sum [\eqref=eq:recur], shows

[formula]

If j(1) = 1 and j(r) < n or if j(1) > 1 and j(r) = n, then [formula]. If j(1) = 1 and j(r) = n then since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Recall the generating functions Fn, defined in the introduction. The following theorem is a recursion formula for these, using the operation [formula] introduced in §[\ref=sec:fps]. Here, as promised, we are using objects defined in §[\ref=sec:fps] with N = 2.

If [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

where

[formula]

We will use the recursion formula [\eqref=eq:recur] for the coefficients in the definition [\eqref=eq:Fdef] of Fn. Since [formula], if [formula], then

[formula]

This takes care of all terms in the sum [\eqref=eq:recur] with r = 1, and these together with the LHS of equation [\eqref=eq:recur] give the LHS of formula [\eqref=eq:Frecur]. Let 2  ≤  r  ≤  n and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Consider a summation beginning at [\eqref=eq:sumi] for some fixed i. If [formula] then all terms with either [formula] or kj(i + 1) = 0 vanish and the summation is equal to the 2pi + 1-homogeneous part of

[formula]

On the other hand, if j(i + 1) - j(i) = 1, then, since [formula] for all [formula], this summation is equal to the 2pi + 1-homogenous part of F1(wj(i),zj(i + 1)). In either case, the summation is equal to the 2pi + 1-homogeneous part of

[formula]

Similarly, we see that the summation beginning at [\eqref=eq:sum1] is equal to the 2p1-homogeneous part of

[formula]

Now using the definition of the operation [formula] and summing over 2  ≤  r  ≤  n and all [formula], one proves the recursion formula [\eqref=eq:recur].

It is straightforward from the recursion formula that

[formula]

Starting from this, one can (in principle) compute Fn for arbitrary given n, using the recursion formula [\eqref=eq:recur]. Below are the results for n = 2,3,4. We were motivated to find and write down F4, although it is rather long, because, while we were able to find F2 and F3 using ad hoc methods to work out, in the notation of Proposition [\ref=prop:11v],

[formula]

we were unable to find, in the notation of Proposition [\ref=prop:adtb],

[formula]

which is needed in computing F4, until we discovered the [formula]-transform.

(n = 2):

[formula]

where u(2)1 = z1w1 + z2w2 and u(2)2 = z1w2 + z2w1.

(n = 3):

[formula]

where

(n = 4):

[formula]

where

For every [formula] with [formula], [formula] is a rational function in variables [formula]. It is, moreover, a sum of terms of the form

[formula]

for some [formula], [formula], [formula] and for [formula] of the form

[formula]

for distinct permutations [formula] of [formula].

This follows by induction on n from the recursion formula [\eqref=eq:recur] and Proposition [\ref=prop:adtb].

Examining the power series of Fn, for each n the conjecture [\eqref=eq:conj] yields a conjectured identity involving multinomial coefficients. For example, when n = 3 we get the conjecture

[formula]

for all [formula].

Contour integration

It follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:rat] that [formula] is a holomorphic function of complex variables [formula] in a suitably small ball around the origin. It is possible, at least in principle, to verify the conjecture mentioned at equation [\eqref=eq:conj] in the introduction for a given value of n from the generating function Fn by performing 2n - 1 contour integrations. For example, letting

[formula]

for suitably small ε > 0 we have

[formula]

Letting

[formula]

we have

[formula]

The conjecture [\eqref=eq:conj] is that

[formula]

for every [formula].

Although the counjecture can be verified without difficulty in the case n = 2 using combinatorial methods, we will illustrate the method described above in checking it. However, even for n = 3, we have been unable to prove the conjecture using the method of contour integration.

We have

[formula]

and ζ  -  ζ2y1w2 - y1z2 = y1w1(r1  -  ζ)(ζ - r2) with

[formula]

If |y1|,  |z2|,  |w2|    <  δ for δ > 0 small enough, r1 can be forced arbitrarily close to zero and r2 can be forced close to ∞  . By the residue theorem,

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Finally,
