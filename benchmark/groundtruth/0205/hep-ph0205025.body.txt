Supersymmetric Higgs Triplets and Bilinear R-Parity Nonconservation Ernest Ma Physics Department, University of California, Riverside, California 92521

In the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) of particle interactions, neutrinos are massless, because R-parity, i.e. [formula], has been imposed. If this is softly broken in the superpotential, i.e. using the bilinear terms μiL̂iĤ2, then one linear combination of the three doublet neutrinos gets a small effective seesaw Majorana mass from the 7  ×  7 neutralino-neutrino mass matrix [\cite=chfe]. The other two linear combinations may also become massive, but only through radiative corrections [\cite=loop]. Another mechanism for obtaining small neutrino masses is to add a Higgs triplet ξ  =  (ξ+  +,ξ+,ξ0) with a small vacuum expectation value [\cite=scva] [\cite=masa]. However, since 〈ξ0〉 should be of order 1 eV or less, this is difficult to achieve with mξ of order 1 TeV unless some new physics such as large extra dimensions is invoked [\cite=marasa]. On the other hand, in the presence of bilinear R-parity nonconservation, 〈ξ0〉 can be naturally small, as shown below. The result is a simple supersymmetric model with three tree-level Majorana neutrino masses (without corresponding heavy singlet neutrino superfields) and no heavy particles beyond the TeV energy scale.

Consider the superfield particle content of the MSSM under the standard gauge group SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y, i.e.

[formula]

The conservation of baryon number B and lepton number L is implicit in the above, which serves to distinguish L̂i (with L = 1) from Ĥ1 (with L = 0). Now add two superfields

[formula]

with L =  - 2 and +2 respectively. The superpotential of this model is then given by

[formula]

where the μi terms break L softly. Note that all other terms which violate L, such as L̂iL̂jêck and Ĥ1Ĥ11, are trilinear and thus assumed to be absent in this model.

Because of the μi terms, the scalar neutrinos necessarily also acquire small vacuum expectation values [\cite=drv]. To see this, consider the following relevant terms in the Higgs potential:

[formula]

where the parameters L and B are the usual ones assumed in the soft breaking of the supersymmetry. Let ui  =  〈i〉 and v2  =  〈φ02〉, then the minimization of V yields [\cite=ma01]

[formula]

As a result, a linear combination of νi gets a Majorana mass given by [\cite=hamasa]

[formula]

where s  =   sin θW, c  =   cos θW, and M1,2 are the supersymmetry breaking Majorana masses of the U(1) and SU(2) gauginos respectively. The parameter ε is given by

[formula]

with ε2  =  ε21  +  ε22  +  ε23 and v2  =  v21  +  v22.

Because of the hij terms of Eq. (5), the Lagrangian of this model has the following additional terms which are relevant for neutrino mass:

[formula]

Hence ξ01 also gets a small vacuum expectation value given by

[formula]

from which

[formula]

is obtained. Note that the overall magnitude of this neutrino mass matrix is comparable to that of Eq. (8) for A, M, and M1,2 roughly of the same order of magnitude. Combining the two allow for a general 3  ×  3 neutrino mass matrix at tree level.

Without further assumptions, the texture of the neutrino mass matrix cannot be determined. However, because M is assumed to be of order 1 TeV, the production and decay of ξ+  +1 [\cite=marasa] as well as other phenomenological predictions of bilinear R-parity violation [\cite=drv] will be testable at future accelerators.

In conclusion, the supersymmetric standard model of particle interactions has been extended to include two Higgs superfields at the TeV scale, carrying two units of lepton number, together with the bilinear breaking of R-parity. This results in three naturally small tree-level Majorana neutrino masses with no new particles beyond the TeV scale, which renders this model experimentally verifiable.
