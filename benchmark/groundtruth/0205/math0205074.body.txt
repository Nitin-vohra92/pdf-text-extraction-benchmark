Curvature tensors whose Jacobi or Szabó operator is nilpotent on null vectors

Introduction

Let V be a vector space equipped with a symmetric inner product of signature (p,q) and dimension [formula]. V is said to be Riemannian if p = 0 and Lorentzian if p = 1. A 4 tensor [formula] is said to be an algebraic curvature tensor if R has the symmetries of the curvature of the Levi-Civita connection:

[formula]

A 5 tensor, which we denote symbolically by [formula], is said to be a covariant derivative algebraic curvature tensor if [formula] has the symmetries of the covariant derivative of the curvature of the Levi-Civita connection:

[formula]

The Jacobi operator [formula] and the Szabó operator [formula] are the symmetric linear operators on V defined by:

[formula]

In Section [\ref=BREF], we study the geometry of the Jacobi operator. Let k be an index 1  ≤  k  ≤  m - 1 and let {e1,...,ek} be an orthonormal basis for a non-degenerate k dimensional subspace σ  ⊂  V. The higher order Jacobi operator defined by Stanilov and Videv [\cite=refStanilovVidev] is the self-adjoint linear map of V given by:

[formula]

this operator is independent of the particular orthonormal basis chosen for σ. The algebraic curvature tensor R is said to be k Osserman if the eigenvalues of JR(σ) are constant on the Grassmannian of non-degenerate k planes in V. Note that if R is k Osserman, then R is m - k Osserman [\cite=refGilkeyStanilovVidev]. Similarly, a pseudo-Riemannian manifold is said to be k Osserman if the eigenvalues of JR(σ) are constant on the Grassmannian of non-degenerate k planes in TM. It is conjectured [\cite=refOss] that a 1-Osserman Riemannian manifold is either flat or is locally a 2 point homogeneous space (i.e. a rank 1 symmetric space). This is known if [formula] mod 2, if [formula] mod 4, and if m = 4 [\cite=refChia]. Although there are some partial additional results known, the general case remains open.

We say that linear map A of V is nilpotent if Am = 0 or equivalently if we have [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m. We complexify and extend g, R, and [formula] to be complex multi-linear on [formula] so that we can use analytic continuation. We say that a complex vector v is null if (v,v) = 0; let N be the set of all complex null vectors. In Section [\ref=BREF], we prove the following two results:

Let R be an algebraic curvature tensor on a vector space of arbitrary signature. If R is k Osserman, then JR(  ·  ) is nilpotent on N.

Let R be an algebraic curvature tensor on a Lorentzian vector space. If [formula] on N, then R has constant sectional curvature.

Theorems [\ref=arefa] and [\ref=arefb] imply the following result in the geometric setting which was proved earlier [\cite=refBokanBlazicGilkey] [\cite=refGra] by different methods when k = 1. There is a similar result in the Riemannian setting if 2  ≤  k  ≤  m - 2 [\cite=refGilkeya]. See also [\cite=refGilkeyStanilovVidev] [\cite=refStanilovVidev].

Let (M,g) be a Lorentzian k Osserman manifold. Then (M,g) has constant sectional curvature.

Let S±(V) and S±(M,g) be the pseudo-spheres and pseudo-sphere bundles of unit timelike (-  ) and spacelike (+  ) vectors. We say that (M,g) is a local 2 point homogeneous space if the local isometries of (M,g) act transitively on S±(M,g); this implies JR(  ·  ) has constant eigenvalues on S+(M,g) and on S-(M,g). The following result now follows from Theorem [\ref=arefc]:

If (M,g) is a connected local 2 point homogeneous Lorentzian manifold, then (M,g) has constant sectional curvature.

Szabó [\cite=refSzabo] showed in the Riemannian setting that if [formula] has constant eigenvalues on S(V), then [formula]. He used this observation to give an elementary proof that any local 2 point homogeneous Riemannian manifold is locally symmetric; of course more is true as (M,g) is a local rank 1 symmetric space or is flat in this setting. This motivates the study of this operator in the higher signature setting. In Section [\ref=CREF], we study the geometry of the Szabó operator and prove the following results:

Let [formula] be a covariant derivative algebraic curvature tensor on a vector space of arbitrary signature. If the eigenvalues of [formula] are constant on S+(V) and on S-(V), then [formula] is nilpotent on N.

Let [formula] be a covariant derivative algebraic curvature tensor on a Lorentzian vector space. If [formula] is constant on S±(V), then [formula].

We remark that one can use analytic continuation to show that if p > 0 and q > 0, then the eigenvalues of [formula] are constant on S+(V) if and only the eigenvalues of [formula] are constant on S-(V); we shall omit the proof in the interests of brevity.

In both the Riemannian and the Lorentzian settings, if [formula] has constant eigenvalues on S+(V) and on S-(V), then [formula]. This can fail in the higher signature setting. Note that if [formula], then [formula] has only the zero eigenvalue.

Let V be a vector space of signature (p,q), where [formula]. There exists a covariant derivative algebraic curvature tensor so that [formula] for all v∈V and so that [formula] does not vanish identically.

The Geometry of the Jacobi Operator

Let [formula] be the Ricci tensor defined by R; we then have [formula]. We say R is Einstein if there is a constant c1 so that ρR(x,y) = c1(x,y) for all x,y∈V. We adopt the notation of [\cite=refCarpenter] and say that R is k-stein if there exist constants ci so [formula] for all x∈V. This definition is motivated by the observation that 1-stein and Einstein are equivalent notions. Note that R is m-stein if and only if R is 1-Osserman [\cite=refGilkey]. We begin our study of the geometry of the Jacobi operator with the following:

Let R be an algebraic curvature tensor on a vector space of arbitrary signature.

If R is k-stein, then [formula] on N.

If R is m-stein, then JR(  ·  ) is nilpotent on N.

If [formula] on N, then R is Einstein.

Proof: Let R be k-stein. We use analytic continuation to see the identity [formula] holds for complex vectors x as well if 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Assertions (1) and (2) then follow. Let x1 and x2 be complex vectors so g(x1,x1) = 1, g(x2,x2) = 1, and g(x1,x2) = 0. Since the cross terms cancel, we may expand

[formula]

Since [formula] is a complex null vector, [formula]. This shows [formula]. It now follows that ρR(x,x) = c(x,x) for any complex vector x and consequently R is Einstein.

We remark that it is necessary to deal with complex null vectors in Lemma [\ref=brefa] to ensure that the statements are non-vacuous in the definite setting as there are no real null vectors if p = 0 or if q = 0. It is not known if the converse to assertion (2) holds, i.e. if JR(  ·  ) is nilpotent on N, then is R is m-stein?

Proof of Theorem [\ref=arefa] Let R be k Osserman and let x1∈N. We must show [formula] for all k. Since the inner product on the complexification of V is non-degenerate, we can choose x2 so [formula]. Define linear functions Ti by Ti(x): = (x,xi). Since T1(x1) = 0, [formula], and [formula], the two linear functions T1 and T2 are linearly independent. We define:

[formula]

If a1x1 + a2x2∈W, then 0 = (a1x1 + a2x2,x1) = a2(x2,x1) so a2 = 0 since [formula]. If a1x1∈W, then 0 = (a1x1,x2) = a1(x1,x2) so a1 = 0. Thus

[formula]

Thus there is a basis {x1,x2,w3,...,wm} for [formula] so that the subset {w3,...,wm} is a basis for W. Suppose that w∈W and that (w,wi) = 0 for 3  ≤  i  ≤  m. Since (w,x1) = (w,x2) = 0, this implies that (w,v) = 0 for all v and hence w = 0. This shows that the induced inner product on W is non-degenerate.

As k - 1  ≤  p + q - 2 =  dim W, there is a non-degenerate k - 1 plane σ  ⊂  W. Let

[formula]

As [formula], g(t) is a non-trivial polynomial of degree at most 2. Thus g(t) has at most two roots; in particular, there exists ε > 0 so [formula] for t∈(0,ε). Let [formula]; π(t) is a non-degenerate k plane for t∈(0,ε). Let t∈(0,ε). As R is k Osserman, there are universal constants ci so [formula] for any non-degenerate real k plane   ⊂  V. Again, analytic continuation permits us to extend this relationship to the complex setting so:

[formula]

Since [formula] is an orthogonal direct sum,

[formula]

We take the limit as [formula] to complete the proof that [formula].

We have the following useful characterization of 1 Osserman algebraic curvature tensors in terms of the order of vanishing of [formula] on the space of complex null vectors N.

Let R be an algebraic curvature tensor on a vector space of arbitary signature. The following conditions are equivalent:

R is 1 Osserman

[formula] as [formula] [formula], [formula], and [formula].

By definition, if R is 1 Osserman, then there exists a constant ck so that [formula] for any z∈V. We complexify and use analytic continuation to see this identity continues to hold for [formula]. We set z = x + ty and (x,x) = 0 to see

[formula]

thus assertion (1) implies assertion (2). Conversely, suppose that assertion (2) holds. Let e1 and e2 be complex unit vectors. We define a polynomial of degree 2k [formula] in the variables (t,s). Since

[formula]

[formula] divides f(t,s). Thus f(t,s) = C(s2 + t2)k. Since we may expand

[formula]

we have [formula] for all k and all complex unit vectors ei. This shows that R is k Osserman.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=arefb] Let V have signature (1,q). We suppose without loss of generality that [formula]. Let {e0,...,eq} be an orthonormal basis for V, where e0 is timelike. Let εi: = (ei,ei); ε0 =  - 1 and εi =  + 1 for [formula]. We shall set Rijkl: = R(ei,ej,ek,el). By assumption, [formula]. We have:

[formula]

Let j be an arbitrary index. The two terms in equation ([\ref=brefba]) with i = 0 and i = 1 are given by:

[formula]

Since ε1εj  +  ε0εj = 0, the terms in equation ([\ref=brefba]) with i = 1 and i = 0 cancel. We may therefore restrict of the index i in equation to the range 2  ≤  i  ≤  q. A similar argument shows that we may restrict j to the range 2  ≤  j  ≤  q. Since εi  =  εj =  + 1 in this range, equation ([\ref=brefba]) shows that a sum of squares is zero. Consequently

[formula]

This holds for any orthonormal basis for V, where e0 is timelike. It now follows that V has constant sectional curvature.

The Geometry of the Szabó operator

Proof of Theorem [\ref=arefd] Let [formula] be a covariant derivative algebraic curvature tensor on a vector space of signature (p,q). If p > 0, assume the eigenvalues of [formula] are constant on S-(V); the argument is similar if q > 0. If k is odd, then [formula] and hence [formula] on S-(V); analytic continuation then implies [formula] vanishes identically. We may therefore suppose k even. We rescale to see there are constants cj so

[formula]

on the open subset of all timelike vectors. Analytic continuation then implies equation ([\ref=crefaa]) holds for all vectors; we take x∈N to complete the proof.

The same argument used to prove Lemma [\ref=brefb] extends to show that [formula] is Szabó if and only if we have that [formula] and that [formula] for every x∈N.

We begin the proof of Theorem [\ref=arefe] with a technical result.

Let [formula] be a covariant derivative algebraic curvature tensor on a Lorentzian vector space. If [formula] is constant on S-(V), [formula].

Proof: As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=arefb], let B: = {e0,e1,...,eq} be an orthonormal basis for V, where e0 is timelike and ei is spacelike for i > 0. Let θ be a real parameter. We define a new orthonormal basis B(θ) by:

[formula]

We have a constant C so that:

[formula]

As [formula] and [formula], we may expand:

[formula]

We take the limit as θ  →    ∞   to see [formula] and hence aij,5 = 0 for all i,j; similarly aij, - 5 = 0. Similarly we have aij,ν = 0 for [formula]. Consequently

[formula]

is independent of θ. On the other hand, since there are three terms involving θ, the powers of eθ which appear in this expression are odd. Thus a22,0 = 0 so

[formula]

Similarly we conclude [formula] for any [formula]. We polarize to see [formula] for any i,j; the vanishing being automatic if i = 0 or j = 0. Thus [formula]. As e0 was arbitary, [formula] on S-(V). Rescaling and analytic continuation then imply [formula] on V.

We complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=arefe] by proving:

Let [formula] be a covariant derivative algebraic curvature tensor on a vector space of arbitrary signature. If [formula], then [formula].

Proof: Since we are in the purely algebraic setting, we only have the pointwise vanishing that [formula]. Thus we can not appeal to an argument using Jacobi fields such as that given in Besse [\cite=refBesse]. Instead, we use an argument based on the curvature symmetries given above; see, for example Vanhecke and Willmore [\cite=refVW] in the Riemannian setting. We polarize the identity

[formula]

by setting y(t): = y + tx and expanding in terms of powers of t. We set the term which is linear in t to zero and then use the curvature symmetries to compute:

[formula]

Set w = x in equation ([\ref=creffa]) to see:

[formula]

Set y(t): = y + tw and expand equation ([\ref=creffc]) in terms of powers of t; the term which is linear in t then yields the identity:

[formula]

We add equations ([\ref=creffb]) and ([\ref=creffD]) to see

[formula]

Set y(t): = y + tz and expand equation ([\ref=creffe]) in terms of powers of t. The term which is linear in t then yields the identity:

[formula]

Set x(t) = x + tv and expand equation ([\ref=creffg]) in terms of powers of t. The term which is linear in t then yields the identity:

[formula]

We use equation ([\ref=creffh]) and the curvature symmetries to complete the proof:

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=arefg] Let [formula] be a completely symmetric trilinear form and L be a symmetric bilinear form on V. We define a 5 tensor:

[formula]

It is immediate that (x,y,z,w;v) =  - (y,x,z,w;v). We interchange the roles of x and z and of y and w to check:

[formula]

We check the first Bianchi identity is satisfied by computing:

[formula]

We check the second Bianchi identity is satisfied by computing:

[formula]

Thus [formula] is an covariant derivative algebraic curvature tensor. Furthermore,

[formula]

Let φ̃x and φ be the associated self-adjoint operators; (x,y,z) = (φx(y),z) and L(x,y) = (φ(x),y). We then have

[formula]

We suppose V has signature (p,q). Let {e±i} be an orthonormal basis for V so [formula] is a maximal timelike subspace and so [formula] is an orthogonal maximal spacelike subspace of V. Let ε, δ, and ϱ be choices of [formula] signs. For 1  ≤  i,j,k  ≤  2, we define:

[formula]

We set (  ·  ) = 0 and L(  ·  ) = 0 if any index is greater than 2. It is immediate from the definition that [formula]. On the other hand
