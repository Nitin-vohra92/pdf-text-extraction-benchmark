Tomonaga-Luttinger-Liquid Theory of Metallic Carbon Nanotubes with Open Boundaries

Introduction

A carbon nanotube is composed of a coaxially rolled graphite sheet[\cite=Iijima] and it's actual length is of the order of 1μm or less than it. The material is characterized by two integers, (N+,N-), corresponding to a wrapping vector along the waist, w  =  N+a+  +  N-a-, where [formula] are primitive lattice vectors of the graphite and |a±|  =  a is the lattice spacing. It has been shown that the carbon nanotubes have peculiar band structures.[\cite=Hamada] [\cite=Saito-I] [\cite=Saito-II] When N+  -  N-  =  0 mod 3, the metallic one-dimensional dispersions appear near the center of the bands. The low energy properties less than v0  /  R (v0 : Fermi velocity, R : radius of the tube) are well described by taking into account only the metallic one-dimensional dispersions. Thus, the metallic carbon nanotubes are considered as the typical one-dimensional conductors.

It has been well known that physical properties of the one-dimensional interacting electron systems cannot be described by conventional Fermi-liquid-theory. Instead, the systems show the behaviors called as Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid. The Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid state is characterized by separation of the charge and spin degrees of freedom, and the anomalous exponents of correlation functions, which depend on the interaction. Carbon nanotubes are one of the most promising candidates where such exotic correlation effects can be observed. The electronic states of the metallic carbon nanotube have been theoretically investigated with taking account of the long-range Coulomb interaction[\cite=EG-I] [\cite=Kane] [\cite=EG-II] [\cite=YO] [\cite=OY] [\cite=OSY] and the novel correlation effects have been found. Experimentally, in the transport measurements for single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs)[\cite=Bockrath] [\cite=Yao] [\cite=Postma], power-law dependences of the conductance as a function of temperature and of the differential conductance as a function of bias voltage have been observed in the metal-SWNT junctions and in the SWNT-SWNT junctions. These results have been interpreted to be due to tunneling between the Fermi-liquid and the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid in the former case, and that between the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid and the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid in the latter case.

The correlation effects of the semi-infinite[\cite=Kane] [\cite=EG-II] and finite length carbon nanotube[\cite=Kane] have been studied theoretically. The local density of state of the semi-infinite SWNT calculated by the bosonization theory explains the transport experiments quantitatively. In ref., the local tunneling density of states of the finite length carbon nanotube has been investigated at absolute zero temperature (T = 0). It has been found that the new energy scale, which reflects the spin-charge separation in the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid, appears in Coulomb blockade behavior in addition to usual charging energy and single-particle level spacing. However, in the above theories, the relationship between the original electron operator and the slowly varying Fermi field describing the low energy physics has not been clarified. The relationship is important for discussing the concrete physical quantities, especially the spatial dependence of those with rapid oscillation determined by Fermi wavelength. Note that the oscillatory component of the local density of states has been neglected in refs. and because the transport measurements are considered to observe the local density of states averaged over several lattice constants. In the present paper, we develop the bosonization theory of the metallic carbon nanotube with open boundaries based on the theory for one-dimensional system[\cite=Fabrizio] with paying attention to the relationship between the two kinds of electron operators. The theory is extended to the case of the multi-wall nanotube (MWNT). By utilizing the theory, the spatial variation of the charge density from an edge is investigated in the presence of the shift of the chemical potential expressing doping of carriers to the nanotube. It is found that the uniform component of the charge density and the wavenumber of the oscillation become smaller compared with the non-interacting case due to the effects of the interaction on the zero modes. The amplitude of the oscillation determined by the bosonic fluctuation is shown to be larger than that in the absence of the interaction. The amplitude for MWNT depends on the number of the metallic shells included in the MWNT, and the effect of the interaction on the amplitude vanishes when the number tends to infinity.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In §.2, the bosonization theory with open boundaries is developed for the SWNT. The theory is extended to the case of the MWNT in §.3. The charge distribution of the SWNT and of the MWNT are calculated in §.4. Section 5 is devoted to summary and discussion.

Bosonization for SWNTs with open boundaries

We formulate the bosonization theory of the metallic SWNT with open boundaries. As a model of the metallic carbon nanotube, we consider the (N,N) armchair nanotube.

Non-interacting case

We consider the armchair carbon nanotube with the length, L, and the radius, [formula], schematically shown in Fig. 1. The Hamiltonian in the tight-binding model is written as H  =  Hk  +  Hint, where Hk is the kinetic part,

[formula]

and Hint describes the mutual interaction,

[formula]

Here t denotes the hopping integral between the nearest-neighbor atoms, and [formula] is the creation operator of the electron with spin s  =    ±   at the location r  -  pd / 2 where [formula] or [formula] (l, m : integer), p =   ±   and [formula]. The interaction, U(r), is given by [formula][\cite=EG-I] with r  =  (x,y) where e, κ and a0 are the electric charge, dielectric constant and short-range cut-off of the interaction, respectively.

At first, we consider the non-interacting case. In order to diagonalize Hk, we solve Schr[formula]dinger equation,

[formula]

with the boundary condition, φr,pK(0,y)  =  φr,pK(L,y)  =  0 and φr,pK(r)  =  φr,pK(r  +  w) where [formula]. The solution and eigenvalue are obtained as follows,

[formula]

where r  =    ±  , [formula] and [formula] with [formula]. The wavenumbers, Kx and Ky, are quantized as Kx  =  nxπ / L [formula] and [formula] [formula]. We note that the energy dispersions with [formula] touch the Fermi energy (Er(K)  =  0) at [formula], and the others do not cross the Fermi energy. The Hamiltonian is written as [formula] where [formula]. When the chemical potential, μ, stays the energy bands with Ky  =  K0y (see Fig.2), the charge density in the absence of the interaction is given at T = 0 for the semi-infinite case, L  →    ∞  , as

[formula]

where K±≃K0  ±  μ / v0 and [formula]. The charge distribution has two parts. One is the uniform part due to the shift of the chemical potential and the other expresses the oscillation (Friedel oscillation). We find that there exit the two kinds of oscillation with the wavenumbers, 2K±, and those are out of phase. The oscillatory behavior is absent for μ  =  0.

We apply the bosonization procedure on the system with the open boundaries[\cite=Fabrizio] to the present model. Energy dispersion is linearized by substituting K  =  (K0  +  k,K0y) into Er(K). When we define the right/left moving electron operator, aR / L,s(K0 + k), as

[formula]

the Hamiltonian, Hk, and the electron operator are respectively written as follows,

[formula]

Here we define the slowly varying Fermi field, ψR / L,α,s(x), as

[formula]

where α  =    ±   is the index corresponding to valleys for the case for periodic boundary condition. The electron operator is expressed by the slowly varying fields as

[formula]

The expression is the same as that in case of the periodic boundary condition. The slowly varying field operators are not independent, but satisfy,

[formula]

Therefore we can actually work with the right moving operator only. The boundary condition, ap,s(0,y)  =  0, is automatically satisfied due to eqs. (16) and (17). However, the condition, ap,s(L,y)  =  0, implies,

[formula]

So we can regard the field ψR,α,s(x) as defined for 0  ≤  x  ≤  2L with the boundary condition,

[formula]

where ν  =  0,  ±  1 is defined as L  =  (3nL  +  ν)a (nL : integer satisfying L  >  0). In terms of the right moving operators, eqs.(9) and (10) are expressed as

[formula]

The above Hamiltonian and the right moving electron operators are straightforwardly bosonized by utilizing Haldane prescription.[\cite=Haldane] The bosonized form for ψR,α,s is given by

[formula]

where ΔNα,s is the extra electron with the index (α,s) and satisfies,   =  iδα,α'δs,s'. The operator, ηα,s, is Majorana Fermion satisfying {ηα,s,ηα',s'}  =  2δα,α'δs,s' and ã is the ultra violet cut-off of the order of 1 / R. The function, φα,s(x), is given by

[formula]

and satisfy φα,s(x + 2L)  =  φα,s(x) because q  =  nπ / L (n : integer). Here bα,s(q) is the boson operator, so satisfies   =  δα,α'δs,s'δq,q'. The density operator, [formula], is given by

[formula]

and ρL,α,s(x)  =  ρR, - α,s( - x). The bosonized form of Hk is given as

[formula]

Before including the mutual interaction, we change the variables of (α,s) to those for charge/spin (j = ρ/σ) degree of freedom of symmetric/antisymmetric (δ =  +  /  - ) combination between the valley index. We define

[formula]

Then   =  δj,j'δδ,δ'δq,q',   =  i,   =  iα,   =  is and   =  iαs. Since the eigenvalue of ΔNα,s is an integer, that of ΔNjδ, Qjδ has a constraint,

[formula]

In terms of the new variables, Hk and ψR,α,s(x) are respectively expressed as follows,

[formula]

with

[formula]

Effects of interaction

We take into account of the mutual interaction, eq.(2). Among the various interaction processes, the term with the strongest amplitude is written in terms of slowly varying Fermi fields as,[\cite=Kane] [\cite=EG-I]

[formula]

where V(0)  =  (2e2  /  κ) ln (Rs / R) where Rs  ~  L characterizes the large distance cut-off of the Coulomb interaction. The other interaction processes, whose couplings scale as a / (2πR) and are extremely small, have been known to play crucial roles in the absence of the carrier doping, i.e., at half-filling.[\cite=Kane] [\cite=YO] [\cite=OY] Since we discuss the case for away from half-filling by introducing the shift of the chemical potential, those are safely neglected. The above interaction has a following bosonized form,

[formula]

Since the interaction term, eq.(39), is expressed by (ρ + ) mode only, the Hamiltonian except (ρ + ) have diagonalized form, H0jδ. The Hamiltonian of (ρ + ) mode, Hρ  +, is diagonalized by Bogoliubov transformation, [formula] with [formula]. As a result, Hρ  + are given as

[formula]

where vρ  +  =  v0  /  Kρ  + and vρ  +  N  =  v0  /  K2ρ  +. The quantity, φρ  +(x), is transformed as

[formula]

in eqs.(36). From eq.(40), the charge susceptibility per unit length is easily derived as 4 / (πvρ  +  N). The quantity is suppressed by the long-range Coulomb interaction because Kρ  +  <  1. For typical metallic nanotubes, the value of Kρ  + is estimated as about 0.2,[\cite=Kane] which leads to strong suppression of the charge susceptibility as 4 / (πv0)  ×  0.04.

Extension to multi-wall nanotubes

In this section, we extend the bosonization theory with open boundaries on the SWNT developed in §.2 to the case of MWNT.[\cite=Egger] We consider the MWNT where NM metallic graphite shells with radii [formula] are included. For simplicity, we consider the case where all the metallic shells consist of armchair nanotubes. The insulating shells in the MWNT can be incorporated in space-dependent dielectric constant. The electron operator for the n-th shell, ap,s,n(r), is given as follows,

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

where {ηα,s,n,ηα',s'n'}  =  2δα,α'δs,s'δn,n', α  ~  1 / RNM,   =  iδn,n',   =  iαδn,n',   =  isδn,n',   =  iαsδn,n', and

[formula]

with   =  δj,j'δδ,δ'δn,n'δq,q'. The Hamiltonian is written in terms of the bosonic variables as

[formula]

Here [formula] expresses the interaction between the n-th and m-th shell with κnm and nm being the dielectric constant between the n-th and m-th shell and the "mean radius"of Rn and Rm introduced in ref., respectively. The modes except (ρ + ) are already diagonalized. By using the orthogonal matrix satisfying [formula], the Hamiltonian for (ρ + ) mode, Hρ  + is written as

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and gj is the eigenvalue of Unm. Equation (47) is diagonalized by Bogoliubov transformation, [formula] ([formula]) as

[formula]

where vj  =  v0 / Kj and vjN  =  v0 / K2j with [formula]. In terms of bj(q) and [formula], φρ  +  n is expressed as

[formula]

Charge distribution

Based on the bosonization theory formulated above, the distribution of the charge density from the one boundary is discussed with taking account of the shift of the chemical potential, μ. The roles of the zero modes and of the bosonic long wavelength fluctuations are clarified.

At first, we consider the SWNT. The term expressing the shift of the chemical potential, -  μΔNρ  +, is added to the Hamiltonian, eq.(40). Using eq.(21), the charge density is given as follows,

[formula]

The first and the second terms are spatially independent and given by

[formula]

On the other hand, the third and fourth terms are given by

[formula]

where [formula], ξρ  +  =  vρ  + / (2πT) and ξ0  =  v0 / (2πT). Here [formula] in the r.h.s. in eq. (53) expresses the average in terms of the zero modes. Since the first line in the r.h.s in eq.(53) expresses the oscillation of the charge density, the zero modes determine the uniform shift of the charge density by the chemical potential, eq.(52), and the wavenumbers of the charge density oscillation. On the other hand, the second and third lines are due to the bosonic fluctuation and express the amplitude of the oscillation.

We consider the semi-infinite case, L  →    ∞  . In this case, the average in terms of zero-modes is easily calculated,

[formula]

and f(2x)  =  (π / 2) sgn(x). As a result, eq.(51) is calculated as follows

[formula]

Note that eq.(56) together with eq.(57) in case of T = 0 and Kρ  +  =  1 reduces to the non-interacting case, eq.(6). The deviation of the uniform charge density, μa / (πNvρ  +  N)  =  μaK2ρ  + / (πv0), and the shift of the wavenumber of the oscillation, 2μ  /  vρ  +  N  =  2μK2ρ  + / v0, are smaller than those in the absence of the interaction. Both quantities are about 0.04 as large as those in the absence of the interaction for the typical SWNT. The fact means that Coulomb interaction prevents the carriers being injected into the nanotube, and has the same origin as suppression of the uniform charge susceptibility. The amplitude of the oscillation, AS(x), is large and decays slowly compared to the non-interacting case as is shown in Fig.3. Here, the amplitude of the oscillation is shown as a function of x / ã for T / Ec  =  0 (solid curves) and T / Ec  =  0.04 (dotted curves) with Ec  =  v0  /  ã. For each temperature, the upper and lower curves express the amplitude in case of Kρ  + = 0.2 and that in the absence of the interaction, i.e., Kρ  +  =  1, respectively. The temperature, T / Ec  =  0.04, corresponds to room temperature for N = 10. Note that the amplitude delays as [formula] for x  ≫  ξρ  +.

Next we consider the case of the MWNT. The charge density of the n-th shell is obtained for L  →    ∞   as,

[formula]

where ξj  =  vj / (2πT). Because of the weak logarithmic dependence of Unm on [formula], we can obtain sensible results by the approximation Unm  =  U. The approximation leads to g1  =  NMU, gj  =  0 for [formula] and [formula]. As a result, the charge density is obtained as

[formula]

where [formula], ξ1  =  v1 / (2πT) with v1  =  v0 / K1 and v1N  =  v0 / K21. The amplitude of the oscillation, AM(x), becomes small with increasing NM as is shown in Fig.3, where the quantity, AM(x), is shown as a function of x / ã for T / Ec  =  0 (solid curves) and T / Ec  =  0.04 (dotted curves) with nm  =  6nm and κnm  =  1.4 for several choices of NM. For each temperature, the curve from top to bottom corresponds to the case of NM  =  1,2,5,  ∞  . We note that the effects of the interaction on AM(x) disappear in the limit, NM  →    ∞  .

Summary and discussion

In the present paper, the bosonization theory with open boundaries was developed for both SWNT and MWNT. We payed attention to the relationship between the electron operator of the tight-binding model and the slowly varying field. Based on this bosonization theory, we investigated the distribution of the charge density from an edge with taking account of the shift of the chemical potential expressing carrier doping to the nanotube.

The bosonized Hamiltonian is written by the sum of symmetric/antisymmetric combination of the charge/spin excitation. Each mode has two contribution, zero modes and bosonic fluctuation. Effects of the Coulomb interaction with the strongest amplitude appear in only the symmetric charge excitation. These facts are the same as the case of the periodic boundary condition. However, the Hamiltonian of zero modes are expressed in terms of only the extra number. This fact is due to the open boundary condition, and different from the periodic boundary condition, where the zero mode Hamiltonian is written by the extra number and the current. The charge distribution in the presence of the shift of the chemical potential has two component. One is spatially independent and the other shows oscillatory behavior which vanishes in the absence of the chemical potential. The zero modes determine the magnitude of the spatially independent component and the wavenumbers of the oscillation. The long-range Coulomb interaction strongly suppress the both quantities. This means the fact that the interaction prevents carriers from being injected into the nanotubes. For the typical SWNT with Kρ  +  =  0.2, the both quantities are about 0.04 as large as those in the absence of the interaction. The quantity, the shift of the chemical potential, corresponds to the applied gate voltage or difference between the work function of the nanotube and that of the substrate material. The carrier doping from the gold substrate has been observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS)[\cite=Wildoer] [\cite=Venema] and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)[\cite=Venema-II]. In the STS experiments, the asymmetry of the density of states has been observed, and it is maintained to be due to the difference between the work function of the nanotube and that of the gold(111) substrate. In the present formalism, the shift of the density of states is just given by the chemical potential even in the presence of the Coulomb interaction,[\cite=Okamura] which is the same as the conclusion in refs. and . However, the deviation of the Fermi wavenumber, δk, in the presence of the chemical potential is given by not the simple form of μ / v0 but μ / vρ  +  N  =  μK2ρ  + / v0 as is seen in eq.(56). On the other hand, the STM experiment observes δk  ~  μ / v0. The discrepancy seems to need the further theoretical study on the Coulomb interaction of the nanotube. The amplitude of the oscillation determined by the bosonic long wavelength fluctuation shows the non-integer power law behavior as a function of the spatial coordinate at T = 0. We found that the amplitude is enhanced by the interaction and it becomes smaller with increasing the number of the metallic shells, NM, in the MWNT and identical with that in the absence of the interaction in the case, NM  →    ∞  . Finally, we note that the present result of the charge distribution are also valid for the strong impurity potential.[\cite=Fabrizio] [\cite=Egger-Grabert] [\cite=EG-II]
