Dispersion Relations and Sum Rules for the π0  →  γγ* and γ*  →  γπ0 Form Factor

Dispersion relation is an useful approach to calculate a physical amplitude when nonperturbative effects are important. For example, in the presence of a low energy resonance, either one has to modify the perturbative results or to use dispersive approach in order to satisfy the unitarity relation. The case of the vector pion form form factor, using dispersion relation, was previously discussed [\cite=truong1]. Sum rules for low energy parameters were written down and were found to be in agreement with the experiment data.

In this article we are interested in calculating the radiative electromagnetic form factor of the pseudoscalar meson π0, for example the form factor of π0 decaying into γe+e- or e+e-  →  π0γ using dispersion relation. These processes are usually studied by the Vector Meson Dominance model [\cite=sakurai] using the Gell-Mann, Sharp Wagner (GMSW) model [\cite=wagner] which includes some non perturbative effects. We want to show that the dispersive approach enables us to express the calculated results in terms of the measurable quantities with a better precision than the GMSW model. Some inacuracies and difficulties of the vector meson dominance using the GMSW scheme can thus be avoided [\cite=rudaz] [\cite=schecter] [\cite=bando].

Our line of approach is similar to the study of the pion form factor [\cite=truong1] [\cite=truong2]. The theoretical calculation was based on the solution of the integral equation of the Muskellishvilli-Omnes type [\cite=mus] [\cite=omnes], using the experimental information on the P-wave phase shifts in the low energy region up to 1 GeV. This approach yields a r.m.s. radius of the pion too low by 10% and the square of the magnitude of the pion form factor at the ρ resonance (i.e. the leptonic width) by 30% [\cite=truong1] [\cite=truong2]. This is also the precision of the VMD model. The GMSW model [\cite=wagner], which used the VMD model [\cite=sakurai], should therefore be accurate to this level.

On the other hand, if the information on the P-wave phase shifts was combined with the experimental magnitude of the time like pion form factor, the r.m.s. of the pion could be evaluated by a sum rule which gave a result in agreement with the data to a few percents [\cite=truong1]. Likewise, if the solution of the Omnes-Muskellishvilli integral equation was used with the input of the experimental value of the r.m.s. radius, the accuracy of the leptonic width of the ρ resonance could also be calculated with an accuracy of a few percents [\cite=truong1] [\cite=truong3] [\cite=truong4].

In using dispersion relation for the 3-point function, one has the choice of dispersing or taking either one the three particles involved off its mass shell, keeping the other two on their mass-shell. For the case of π0  →  γγ* or γ*  →  γπ0, one disperses in one of the photon mass squared variable. In the following, we denote the dispersed photon as γ* and the on shell photon simply as γ. Unlike the GMSW scheme [\cite=wagner], we do not take two photons simultaneously off their mass shells, for which dispersion relations are not justified from a more fundamental viewpoint.

Proceeding with the GMSW scheme, one can calculate the π0  →  γγ amplitude which was found to agree with the π0γγ anomaly [\cite=bell] and also with the experimental data [\cite=pdg]. In this calculation, one uses the experimental data on the leptonic widths of ρ, ω, the ω  →  πγ width and the SU(3) relation relating ρπγ vertex to ωπγ. The γ3π amplitude [\cite=rudaz] [\cite=schecter] [\cite=bando] in the chiral limit is a factor of 3 / 2 too large compared with that given by the anomaly [\cite=adler]. Although the introduction of a contact term in the γ  →  3π amplitude could solve this problem [\cite=bando], there is a problem with unitarity which will be discussed elsewhere [\cite=truong5].

It is therefore desirable to use dispersion relation, in combination with unitarity, to solve this problem.

For the decay process π0  →  γ(k)γ*(q), neglecting the electron positron masses, the kinematics requires that 0  ≤  q2  ≤  m2π. The space-like radiative form factor of π0 can be measured by the two photon processes in e+e- collision, e+e-  →  e+e-π0, keeping one of the exchanged photon almost on its mass shell and the other photon off its mass shell. The limit of the space-like momentum transfer is not limited by the π0 mass, but by the kinematics of the two photon process. Likewise the time-like radiative form factor of the π0γ can be measured by the process e+e-  →  π0γ i.e. the production of π0 and γ by the single photon exchanged process. There is no kinematical limitation of the time-like momentum transfer. We shall study this form factor as a function of the momentum transfer squared from - 1GeV2  <  q2 < 1GeV2.

The Isovector Matrix Element

The electromagnetic hadronic current is decomposed into two parts, the isovector and isoscalar contributions. The lowest number of pion contributions are, respectively, two and three pion states. These are the most important states because they are associated with, respectively, the ρ and ω vector mesons. Dispersing in the photon mass one must take into the contributions of the 2π and 3π states with the total angular momentum corresponding to the photon or J = 1- states. Because of the G-Parity invariance for strong interaction, these two states are orthogonal and we can therefore consider their contribution separately. The final result for the form factors γ*  →  γπ or π  →  γγ* is the algebaic sum of their contributions.

The isovector and isoscalar contributions are denoted, respectively, as F3(q2) and F0(q2). More explicitly the isovector contribution to the matrix element can be written as:

[formula]

and similarly the corresponding amplitude for the isoscalar contribution is denoted by F0γγ*(q2). In the following, for convenience, we set [formula].

At zero momentum transfer s = 0, the off-shell photon becomes the on-shell photon and hence the matrix element in Eq. ([\ref=eq:pgg*]) is just given by the matrix element of π0  →  γγ and is given by the chiral anomaly:

[formula]

where the number of color Nc = 3 has been used and fπ = 93MeV is the pion decay constant and e is the electric charge. It is generally assumed that the matrix element for the physical pseudoscalar π0 is not very much different from its chiral value, Eq. ([\ref=eq:pgg]). This is a plausible assumption, which will be used in this article, because it is well verified for π0  →  2γ decay.

It is clear that F3γγ*(s) is an analytic function in the complex s plane. Depending on the assumption on its asymptotic behavior and the precision of the calculation, an unsubtracted, once or twice subtracted dispersion relation for F3γγ* can be written. Similarly its first, second ... derivatives at any point except on the positive real axis with s  ≥  4m2π can be written in terms of its imaginary part. For simplicity in writing we shall drop, at the moment, the superscript and subscript of the funcion F3γγ* and simply write it as F(s).

Because the form factor F(s) is an analytic function with a cut from 4m2π to ∞  , the nth times subtracted dispersion relation for F(s) reads:

[formula]

where n  ≥  0 and, for our purpose, the series around the origin is considered. Because of the real analytic property of F(s), it is real below 4m2π. By taking the real part of this equation, ReF(s) is related to the principal part of the dispersion integral involving the ImV(s) apart from the subtraction constants an.

The polynomial on the R.H.S. of Eq. ([\ref=eq:ff1]) will be referred in the following as the subtraction constants and the last term on the R.H.S. as the dispersion integral (DI). The evaluation of DI as a funtion of s will be done later. Notice that an = Fn(0) / n! is the coefficient of the Taylor series expansion for F(s), where Fn(0) is the nth derivative of F(s) evaluated at the origin.

In theoretical work such as in perturbation theory, the number of subtractions is minimal in the sense that it just makes the DI converges. In general, the more subtractions we make, the better is the suppression of the high energy contribution which, in general,is difficult to calculate. This high energy suppression makes the calculation more reliable, but at the same time, makes the calculation less predictive because of the introduction of extra parameters.

ImF(s) can be evaluated using the unitarity relation. Instead of taking a complete set of intermediate states in the unitarity relation, we truncate the summation and keep only the two pion P state. We shall show below that this approximation is sufficiently accurate to analyse the data for s below 1 GeV2.

It is straightforward to show in this case:

[formula]

where V(s) is the vector pion form factor with the normalisation V(0) = 1 and G1(s) is the P-wave projection of the invariant amplitude for γπ+  →  π+π0:

[formula]

where ε is the photon polarisation, s = (k + q+)2, t = (p+ - q+)2 and u = (p0 - q+)2. Because all particles involved are on shell, one has s + t + u = 3m2π. In the center of mass system, in terms of the scattering angle θ, we have:

[formula]

The partial wave expansion for G(s,t,u) is given as follows [\cite=martin] [\cite=hannah]:

[formula]

where θ is the scattering angle and hence

[formula]

In terms of the function G(s,t,u) the differential cross section for the process γπ±  →  π±π0 is

[formula]

In Eq. ([\ref=eq:unit]), the elastic unitarity relation for the vector pion form factor requires that the phase of V(s) is the phase of the P-wave ππ strong interaction δ(s). Similarly, the phase of for the P-wave amplitude G1(s) of the amplitude γπ+  →  π+π0 is also δ(s). The product V(s)*G(s) is therefore real and hence we can rewrite Eq. ([\ref=eq:unit]) as:

[formula]

where we have restored the subscripts and superscripts. This equation is ambiguous to a plus or minus sign. In the following we take the positive sign by convention. Hence ImF(s) is only given in terms of the measurable quantities, |V(s)| and |G1(s)|.

There are excellent experimental data on the vector pion form factor but accurate experimental data on γπ+  →  π+π0 are not available. To proceed, at this stage, one has to use some theoretical studies on this process which will be discussed below.

Besides the 2π, there are higher mass states contributing to the unitarity relation for ImF3γγ*(s). For example, the [formula] or the 4π states in the form of the ωπ or the ρππ states etc. could become important at an energy above 1 GeV. As long as we are interested in the phenomology below this energy region, it may be safe to take only into account of the lowest intermediate states which, for the isovector contribution, is the interacting two pion state or the ρ vector meson, and for the isoscalar contribution, the interacting three pion states or the ω vector meson.

If we want to find out how important is the 2π contribution in the form of ρ compared with the higher intermediate states, we can write an unsubtracted dispersion relation for F3γγ*(s) and then evaluate this amplitude at s = 0 to compare with the amplitude of π0  →  2γ. Needless to say, such an use of an unsubtracted dispersion relation can be opened to criticisms because the higher intermediate states are not strongly suppressed; we can only hope that, at low energy, their contributions are small compared with the 2π and hence can be neglected. This is the spirit of the Vector Meson Dominance model in the more precised language of the dispersion theory.

On the other hand if the e+e- spectrum in the π0  →  γe+e- process is to be calculated the higher intermediate states are then suppressed by a factor s- 2 (see below) which makes the result more reliable. The higher the derivative is at s = 0, the larger is the suppression of the high energy contribution.

We shall parametrize phenomenologically the pion form factor data below 1.1 GeV by the following formula [\cite=truong4] which agrees well with the experimental data [\cite=barkov] [\cite=aleph]:

[formula]

where fπ = 0.093GeV, and sR = 30.2m2π which gives a good fit to the modulus of the pion form factor below 1.1 GeV and the P-wave ππ phase shifts in this energy range. Hππ(s) is a well-known integral over the phase space factor:

[formula]

Neither good experimental data on |G(s,t,u)| nor its P-wave amplitude G1(s) are available. In fact, the data on the width Γ(ρ  →  πγ) are in contradiction [\cite=capraro] [\cite=dolinsky]. Once the experimental data on |G1(s)| are available they can directly be used in Eq. ([\ref=eq:unitt]) to calculate the π0γ form factor.

For the time being, it is reasonable to use some theoretical models to parametrize G1(s). This can be done by assuming the elastic unitarity relation and dispersion relation for this process. A more complicated singular integral equation than that of the Muskelishvili-Omnes type is obtained [\cite=truong5]. Given the experimental P-wave ππ phase shifts, its solution, which is related to the Γ(ρ  →  πγ) width, can be obtained by a numerical method and is a sensitive function of the second derivative of G1(s) with respect to s at s = m2π. This problem is related to the existence of the contact term in the photon-3π coupling [\cite=rudaz] [\cite=schecter] [\cite=bando]. Because G1(s) is an analytic function in the s variable with a unitarity right hand cut extending from 4m2π to ∞  , and a left hand cut on the negative s axis. On the right cut this function, by unitarity, must have the phase of the strong P-wave ππ interaction δ(s). The left hand cut is due to the t and u channel contributions. From general grounds, the P-wave amplitude can be written as a product of the two cuts, the right and left hand cuts. For our purpose, the left hand cut contribution will be, phenomenologically, represented by the product of a double pole and a term linear in s. We have hence:

[formula]

where c,a,b are real and G01 is the chiral anomaly of γ  →  3π:

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=eq:fit2]), with the real parameters a,b,c, is flexible enough to fit the solution of the theoretical calculation. It also gives the correct phase for the P-wave amplitude of the process γπ+  →  π+π0 which are the P-wave ππ phase shifts below 1.1 GeV. This parametrization is most accurate in the energy range 0.20GeV2  <  s < 0.8GeV2 where its contribution to the following low energy sum rules is most important.

Instead of characterizing the results of the theoretical calculation as a function of the input second derivative values at s = m2π, it is more physical to express them as a function of the Γ(ρ  →  πγ) width which is defined by the value of Eq. ([\ref=eq:fit2]) compared with its corresponding Breit-Wigner formula at s = m2ρ.

In Table 1, we give the values of the parameters as a function of the Γ(ρ  →  πγ) widths.

Rewriting Eq. ([\ref=eq:unitt]) in the unit of Fγγ as given by Eq. ([\ref=eq:pgg]) one has:

[formula]

Now knowing ImF3γγ*(s) we can write down sum rules and dispersion relation.

Let us begin with testing the notion of the vector meson dominance, which can be translated into the dispersion language, by assuming an unsubtracted dispersion relation for F(s). This allows us to find out how much the contribution of ImF3γγ*(s) is in the π0  →  γγ amplitude.

Writing an unsubtracted dispersion relation for F3γγ*(s) and set s = 0 we have:

[formula]

The use of an unsubtracted dispersion relation requires that F3γγ*(s)  →  0 as s  →    ∞  . It is model dependent because the high energy contribution to ImF3γγ* is only suppressed by a factor of s in the sum rule, Eq. ([\ref=eq:charge]).

With this reservation, using ImF3γγ*(s) as given by Eq. ([\ref=eq:unitt]), with the pion form factor |V(s)| given by Eq. ([\ref=eq:vu1]) and with the γπ  →  ππ amplitude given in Table 1, the matrix element of the isovector [formula] can be calculated as a function of the Γ(ρ  →  πγ)width. The results of our calculation are given on the 5th column of the Table 1.

We now want to calculate the energy dependence or the pair e+e- in π0  →  γe+e- at low energy. This can sufficiently be done by evaluating the first derivative of F3γγ*(s) at the origin:

[formula]

and if more precision is needed one could include higher derivatives. For example the second derivative is given by:

[formula]

The sum rule for the first derivative at s = 0 of F3γγ* is quite reliable because the unknown high energy contribution is suppressed by the factor 1 / s2 in Eq. ([\ref=eq:der1]). The slope is usually expressed in terms of of the slope parameter βi defined as βis / m0π2 with i = 0,3 for, respectively, the isoscalar and isovector contributions.

In table 1, the slope parameter for the isovector contribution is also given in the 5th column. The precision of the experimental data do not allow us to compare the second derivative of F3γγ*. We shall compare the values of the matrix elements and slopes after our calculation of the isoscalar contribution.

In evaluating the RHS of Eq. ([\ref=eq:charge]) or Eq ([\ref=eq:der1]), the P-wave phase space factor in Eq. ([\ref=eq:unitt]) suppresses strongly the low energy contribution of the modulus of the amplitude γπ  →  π+π-. They are therefore very insensitive to the low energy behavior of this amplitude. The well-known problem of reconciling Vector Meson Dominance and the γ3π chiral anomaly is not a problem here. It will be discussed in a separate study [\cite=truong5].

The Isoscalar Matrix Element

Dispersing in the isoscalar photon mass, we have to take into account of the lowest intermediate state in the unitarity relation, the 3π states. The total isospin of the 3 pions is I = 0 and its total angular momentum is 1- hence they are spacely completely antisymmetric. The elastic unitarity contribution to the isoscalar amplitude is: F0γγ*(s).

[formula]

Again, after integrating over the internal variables for the 3 pion system, we can establish the phase theorem for <  γ|3π  >   as in the case of the 2 pion contribution to the isovector form factor. The RHS of Eq. ([\ref=eq:unitarity]) is therfore real and we can rewrite it as:

[formula]

Hence ImF0γγ*(s), similar to the isovector case, can be directly obtained from experimental data. There are good data for the process γ*  →  3π which shows a complete dominance of the ω contribution.

The process γπ  →  3π has not been measured. However, the 3 pion resonance is such a narrow one that it is possible to approximate it accurately by the ω meson. This is also true for the photon 3 pion vertex.

Defining the photon ω coupling as em2ω / gω [\cite=wagner] with the photon invariant mass squared equal to the ω mass the gω can be determined from its leptonic width: Γ(ω  →  e+e-)  =  (4πα2 / 3)(mω / g2ω). The ω  →  π0γ width is given by: Γ(ω  →  π0γ) = g2ωπγE3γ / (12π). Using the experimental values, mω = 782MeV, Γω = 8.41  ±  .09MeV and the branching ratio Γω  →  πγ  /  Γω = 8.5  ±  .5%, one can easily verify:

[formula]

hence the ω contribution is just half of the π0γγ anomaly, Eq. ([\ref=eq:pgg]). The imaginary part of the isoscalar form factor can be straightforwardly deduced from this result:

[formula]

where Γ(s) is strongly dependent on s due to the three pion phase space. We shall neglect altogether the real part of the ω self energy correction.

Sum of the isovector and isoscalar matrix elements

Knowing the imaginary part of the form factor, Eqs. ([\ref=eq:isov], [\ref=eq:sigo]) and using dispersion relation, there is no difficulty in calculating the form factor in the interval - 1GeV2 < s < 1GeV2. The energy dependence of the π0  →  γγ*, as will be shown below, requires us to take the same sign for the imaginary part of the isoscalar and isovector contributions.

π0  →  γγ and π0  →  γγ*

Let us first examine the π0  →  γγ and π0  →  γγ* amplitudes. The observable matrix element Fγγ*(s) is the sum of the isoscalar and the isovector matrix elements. They cannot experimentally be separated from each other. We want to find out how much the two and three pion intermediate states (in the form of ω and ρ) contributing to the π0  →  γγ amplitude. Using Eq. ([\ref=eq:omega]) and the results given on the fifth column of the Table 1, the total matrix elements are given in Table 2. They should be compared with experimental value [\cite=pdg] [\cite=behrend]

[formula]

Comparing this result with those given by Table 2 it is clear that the matrix element corresponding to Γ(ρ  →  πγ) = 92KeV is favored. The experimental errors are, however, large.

Because we have more faith in the slope sum rule than the unsubtracted dispersion relation due to the suppression of the high energy contribution the prediction on the Γ(ρ  →  πγ) width can reliably be made once the slope is better measured.

Time-Like and Space-Like π0γ Form Factor

:

Using the imaginary part of the isovector and isoscalar contributions to the form factor Fγγ*(s) as given by Eqs. ([\ref=eq:isov], [\ref=eq:sigo]) we can calculate the s-dependence of the form factor from - 1GeV2  <  s  <  1GeV2 with reliability by the following subtracted dispersion relation:

[formula]

where ImFγγ*(s) is given by the sum of the RHS of Eqs. ([\ref=eq:isov], [\ref=eq:sigo]).

Because of the overwhelmed dominance of the ω contribution to the form factor Fγγ(s) around the ω  -  ρ region, there is little hope to get physics out of the ρ and ω region unless the accuracy of the cross section measurement can be improved to a few percents. Likewise, an improvement in the determination of the space like behavior of the form factor will enable us also to determine accurately the ρπγ width.

Conclusion and Acknowledgements

The main point of this paper is to show the usefulness of the dispersion relation approach which has not effectively been used in the literature for this problem. It allows us to relate various experimental measurements without making strong assumptions. The non perturbative effects due to strong interaction are straightforwardly handled by dispersion relation and unitarity.
