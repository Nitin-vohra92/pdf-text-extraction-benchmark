Abstract

The Serre-Swan theorem provides the link between projective modules of finite rank and vector bundles over compact manifolds, and plays a prominent role in non-commutative geometry. Its extension to non-compact manifolds is discussed.

The Serre-Swan theorem had been established for continuous functions and sections [\cite=swan], but then it was extended to the smooth case (see Proposition 4.1 in Ref. [\cite=land] and Proposition 3.1, Theorem 3.2 in Ref. [\cite=var]).

Recall that smooth manifolds are assumed to be real, finite-dimensional, Hausdorff, second-countable, and connected. Vector bundles are finite-dimensional.

In non-commutative geometry, one therefore thinks of a finite projective *  -module over a dense unital *  -subalgebra of a C*-algebra as being a non-commutative vector bundle.

Note that item (i) of Theorem [\ref=sp60] is equivalent to the following well-known theorem (see Theorem 6.5 in Ref. [\cite=karo] in the continuous case).

The key point of the proof of item (i) of Theorem [\ref=sp60] is that any vector bundle over a compact manifold X admits a bundle atlas over a finite covering of X. Proposition IX in Ref. [\cite=greub] generalizes this assertion to non-compact manifolds as follows.

A smooth fibre bundle Y  →  X over an arbitrary manifold X admits a bundle atlas over a finite covering of X.

Its proof is based on the fact that, for any covering of a manifold X, there exists a refinement {Uij}, where j and i run through a countable set and a finite set, respectively, such that [formula], j  ≠  k. Let {Uξ,ψξ} be a bundle atlas of a fibre bundle Y  →  X over a covering {Uξ} of X. Let {Uij} be the above mentioned refinement of this covering and {(Uij,ψij)} the corresponding bundle atlas of Y  →  X. Then Y  →  X has the finite bundle atlas

[formula]

It is readily observed that, if Y  →  X is a vector bundle, the atlas ([\ref=ss2]) is an atlas of a vector bundle. It follows that every smooth vector bundle admits a finite atlas, and the proof in Refs. [\cite=land] [\cite=var] of item (i) of Theorem [\ref=sp60] can be generalized straightforwardly to non-compact manifolds. Similarly, the above mentioned Theorem 6.5 in [\cite=karo] can be extended to non-compact finite-dimensional topological manifolds. The proof of item (ii) in Theorem [\ref=sp60] does not imply the compactness of X.
