Abstract

Estimates are presented for the branching ratios of several two-particle B-meson decays into flavoured scalar mesons.

It seems that there are no estimates of B-meson decays into scalar mesons. The purpose of this short note is to present such estimates. As will be shown, some two-particle decays of B-mesons into scalar mesons have sufficiently large branchings to be of current interest.

1. Having in mind B-  →  qo(1430)π- and B-  →  qπ- decays, the main contributions in the factorization approximation which looks reliable for these decays, and in the standard notation, come from two terms in the effective Hamiltonian:

[formula]

[formula]

The effective coefficients ai in (1) can be expressed either explicitly through the original coefficients Ci(μ) of the effective Hamiltonian [\cite=Bur], plus perturbative one loop corrections: Ci(μ)  →  Ceffi; this cancels the main scale dependence of Ci(μ), see e.g. [\cite=Ali] and references therein. Or they can be calculated in "the QCD improved factorization approximation" [\cite=Ben], which is not much different.

In what follows we will not need their explicit form, but only the typical value of the ratio a6 / a4.

The matrix elements are defined as:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, the decay amplitudes look as:

[formula]

[formula]

Now, about parameters entering (3). To avoid main uncertainties it is reasonable to take the ratio Br(Koπ) / Br(Kπ). So, it will be sufficient to know (fk≃160  MeV):

[formula]

The main new parameter is the coupling fo. It can be estimated from the form factor ([formula]:

[formula]

[formula]

Saturating the dispersion relation for d(q2) by two lowest resonances, Ko(1430) and Ko(1950), one obtains:

[formula]

where fi are couplings of resonances with the scalar current (see eq.(2) above, the coupling [formula] of Ko(1950) with the current ms(s̄d) is defined in the same way as those of Ko(1430);  fi = O(ms) at ms  →  0), and gi are their couplings to the (K-π+)-pair. These last can be found from their known decays to [formula]. Besides, there are estimates [\cite=Jam] of the ratio of couplings [formula] which look as:

[formula]

Therefore, one obtains:

[formula]

Collecting all the above given numbers, we have:

[formula]

(for central values of parameters in (4) and (6)).

So, if Br(B-  →  qπ-)≃16  ·  10- 6, then Br(B-  →  qo(1430)π-) will be ≃43  ·  10- 6.

It is interesting not only that Br(B-  →  qo(1430)π-) is large by itself, but that it receives the dominant contribution from the term ~  a6 which is a power correction, O(ΛQCD / Mb), in the formal limit Mb  →    ∞  .

2. Let us consider the decay [formula]. The corresponding form factor FBa+ is defined as:

[formula]

[formula]

Such form factors, at not too large q2, can be found by the method proposed in [\cite=Ch] (which is known now as "the light-cone sum rules"). One considers the correlator:

[formula]

and proceeding as in [\cite=Ch] obtains the sum rule (Δ = (1 - M2b / So)≃0.3):

[formula]

where the wave function φs(x) of a+o(1450) is defined as:

[formula]

The coupling λ̄2  =  λ2(μ≃1.5  GeV) is related by SU(3) to the matrix element 〈K*o(1430)(q)|s̄  d|0〉 in (2), and so: λ̄2≃1.15  GeV2. For other quantities entering (8) we use: φs(x)≃φasys(x) = 1,  fB≃fπ≃130  MeV. One obtains then from (8):

[formula]

Somewhat surprisingly, this transition form factor turns out to be ≃1.5 times larger than the corresponding B  →  π form factor: fBπ+(0)≃0.30. Finally, this is due to strong coupling of scalar mesons to the scalar current.

Proceeding now in the same way as above, one obtains the decay amplitude:

[formula]

The two terms in square brackets in (10) nearly cancel each other. So, we conclude that [formula] is very small, in spite of the large form factor.

3. Let us consider now the decay [formula]. Proceeding as before, one obtains the decay amplitude (it follows from the above that the penguin contribution is negligible):

[formula]

One has then from (11) and (9):

[formula]

It is seen that these branchings are sufficiently large to be observable.

4. Finally, let us consider production of two scalar mesons, B-  →  qo(1430)a-o(1450). Proceeding as before, one obtains from (1) the decay amplitude:

[formula]

Normalizing by B-  →  qπ- as before, and using (6), (9) one obtains:

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, for Br(B-  →  qoπ-)  ≃16  ·  10- 6, these branchings (as well as their charge conjugates) will be ≃140  ·  10- 6. It is seen that, in a sense, they are very large.

5. We do not consider here the neutral decay modes like, for instance, Bo  →  J / ΨKo(1430). Because the main factorizable contributions cancel each other here to large extent, the non-factorizable contributions become of great importance, and these are under poor control for such decays at present. One can expect only that, because the transition form factor B  →  Ko(1430) is considerably larger than those of B  →  K, this mode can hardly be much smaller than B  →  J / ΨK.

We did not consider also flavourless scalars fo(980),  fo(1370),  fo(1500), etc. There are two reasons for this. First, their nature and quark-gluon composition are not well understood at present and, it seems, are complicated. The main reason, however, is that we expect their production in the B  →  fiK decays can be highly enhanced by the same mechanism which enhances [formula], and there is no clear understanding of this mechanism up to now.

I am indebted to A.E. Bondar who insisted on writing this note. I also thank him for very useful discussions.
