In this paper we describe explicitly how the twisted "bundles" on a D-brane worldvolume in the presence of a nontrivial B field, can be understood in terms of sheaves on stacks. We also take this opportunity to provide the physics community with a readable introduction to stacks and generalized spaces.

Introduction

In the presence of a nontrivial NS B field, the bundle on a D-brane worldvolume is not really a bundle at all, but rather is twisted. This was pointed out by, for example, [\cite=freeded], and is due to the fact that under a gauge transformation the Chan-Paton gauge field A necessarily transforms as (where I is the N  ×  N identity, for a U(N) gauge theory).

As a result, if we describe the B field in generality in terms of local 2-forms Bα together with overlap data Aαβ, hαβγ (with respect to some open cover {Uα}), related as

[formula]

then the transition functions gαβ of the D-brane worldvolume "bundle" no longer completely close on triple overlaps, but rather

Now, one can certainly ask what sort of formal structure should be used to describe such "bundles."

One approach, popular in noncommutative geometry circles, is to think of these as modules over Azumaya algebras [\cite=kapustin] (see also [\cite=bm] [\cite=caldararu]). However, this description has two drawbacks:

First, Azumaya algebras are only relevant to describing B-field configurations whose curvature H is a torsion element of [formula]. One would like a more general understanding.

Second, the Azumaya algebra description is closely tied to noncommutative geometry, and one would like a description that is useful away from the Seiberg-Witten noncommutative geometry limit.

In this technical note we shall point out that the D-brane worldvolume "bundles" can also be understood in terms of sheaves on stacks, where the stacks in question arise as the formal structures describing the B-field (in the same sense that a bundle is a formal structure describing a gauge field).

More generally, there is lore in the mathematics community that stacks and noncommutative geometry are not unrelated. The work in this paper - the fact that D-brane "bundles," at least for torsion H, can be understood either in terms of noncommutative geometry (modules over Azumaya algebras) or as sheaves on stacks - is just one aspect of the correspondence. We hope to report in detail on this correspondence in future work.

Because stacks are not familiar to most physicists, we have included a short review of relevant definitions and aspects. Although stacks have gained a fearsome reputation in some quarters, we hope that our presentation should help dispell myths that stacks are necessarily difficult to work with.

We begin in section [\ref=gpoid] with a review of groupoids. The precise technical definition of "groupoid" unfortunately seems to vary between authors; our use is in the sense of [\cite=vistoli] [\cite=gomez], and essentially is the same thing as a presheaf of categories. In section [\ref=presf] we describe presheaves on groupoids. In section [\ref=site] we describe how one can put a topology on a groupoid, which is necessary if one wants to talk about sheaves on groupoids, not just presheaves. In section [\ref=stk] we describe stacks, which are special kinds of groupoids. In essence, if we view a groupoid as a presheaf of categories, then a stack is a sheaf of categories. Finally in section [\ref=sfstk] we describe sheaves on stacks, and in particular describe specifically how the twisted "bundles" on D-brane worldvolumes can be understood as sheaves on stacks (where the stacks in question describe the B-field). We conclude in section [\ref=concl]. We have also included an appendix describing explicitly how groupoids are related to "presheaves of categories," as described in, for example, [\cite=brylinski] [\cite=breen] [\cite=dt2].

Groupoids

Definition of groupoid

Let U be the category of open sets on X (i.e., objects are open sets, and morphisms are inclusions).

A groupoid over a space X [\cite=vistoli] [\cite=gomez] is defined to be a category F together with a functor PF:F  →  U, obeying the following two axioms:

If [formula] is a morphism in U and η is an object of F with pF(η)  =  V, then there exists an object ξ∈F and a morphism f:ξ  →  η such that pF(ξ)  =  U and pF(f)  =  ρ.

If φ:ξ  →  ζ and ψ:η  →  ζ are morphisms in F and h:pF(ξ)  →  pF(η) is a morphism such that [formula], then there exists a unique morphism χ:ξ  →  η such that [formula] and pF(χ)  =  h.

Strictly speaking, references [\cite=vistoli] [\cite=gomez] defined groupoids in algebraic geometry. Instead of working with a category U of open sets on X, those references replaced U with the category of X-schemes. However, aside from that replacement, the definitions are identical. We should also point out that essentially the same approach to stacks has previously been used in [\cite=brylinski] [\cite=breen] [\cite=dt2]. More generally, although stacks are often used by algebraic geometers and so are often written in reference to schemes, stacks do not have anything to do with schemes per se, and can be described at a purely topological level. See [\cite=brylinski] [\cite=breen] [\cite=dt2] [\cite=fantechi] [\cite=teleman] for discussions of such topological stacks.

Intuitively, what is a groupoid? Although it is not immediately obvious, a groupoid is equivalent to a "presheaf of categories," i.e., a prestack as defined in [\cite=dt2]. We discuss this equivalence in detail in appendix [\ref=gpdeqprest]. We shall have little use for this point of view, but it does give a more intuitive picture of groupoids.

As a technical aside, note that the pair (ξ,f) determined in the first groupoid axiom differs from any other pair (ξ',f') satisfying the same constraint by a unique isomorphism χ:ξ  →  ξ', according to the second axiom. Since ξ is determined uniquely (up to unique isomorphism), ξ is commonly denoted ρ*η. Also note that there is a canonical morphism ρ*η  →  η.

As another technical aside, note that if α is a morphism in F such that pF(α)  =  , then α is necessarily an isomorphism. Write α:ξ  →  ζ, then apply the second groupoid axiom to the maps [formula] and [formula] to find that there exists a unique map χ such that [formula]. Using almost the same argument one can show that [formula] for some χ', and by composition, χ  =  χ'. Hence α is invertible, and hence is an isomorphism. Conversely, if α is an isomorphism, we have that pF(α)  =   (since we have defined groupoids over ordinary spaces).

One commonly denotes by F(U), U an open set on X and F a groupoid on X, the subcategory of F defined by

Objects are η∈F such that pF(η)  =  U

Morphisms are morphisms f:ξ  →  η such that ξ,η∈F(U) and pF(f)  =  U.

Note this means that morphisms in F(U) are invertible.

Given a groupoid F, we can define a presheaf of sets U(x,y) for any open U  ⊆  X and any x,y∈F(U), as follows:

For any open V  ⊆  U, the set of sections is the set F(V)(x|V,y|V).

For any inclusion map [formula] of open sets in U, define the restriction map as follows. Let f:x|U1  →  y|U1 be an element of the set (i.e., a morphism). Define ρ*f to be the unique map that makes the following diagram commute:

where unmarked arrows are canonical, f|U2 is the unique morphism making the middle left square commute (whose existence follows from the second groupoid axiom), and the arrows marked with a *   are the unique morphisms that make the top and bottom squares commute (whose existence follows from the second groupoid axiom).

Note that the presheaf above is not quite defined uniquely, since the restrictions x|V are only defined up to unique isomorphism. However, it is straightforward to check that those unique isomorphisms define an isomorphism of presheaves, so the presheaf U(x,y) is defined up to unique isomorphism.

Examples

Let X be a topological space, and U the category of open sets on X. Then U, together with the identity map U  →  U, forms a trivial example of a groupoid on X. Sometimes we shall simply use X itself to denote this groupoid trivially associated to X.

Let S be a presheaf of sets on a space X. Then S defines a groupoid on X, as follows:

Objects are pairs (U,ξ), where U is an open subset of X, and ξ∈S(U).

Morphisms (U,ξ)  →  (V,ζ) are inclusion maps [formula] such that ξ  =  ρ*ζ.

It is straightforward to check that this defines a groupoid on X. (Indeed, presheaves of sets furnish trivial examples of prestacks, as noted in [\cite=dt2].)

Morphisms of groupoids

A morphism of groupoids F  →  G over a space X is defined to be a functor F:F  →  G such that [formula], i.e., commutes.

We shall see in appendix [\ref=gpdeqprest] that a morphism of groupoids is equivalent to a Cartesian functor between the associated prestacks. Also, a natural transformation between two morphisms of groupoids is equivalent to a 2-arrow between associated Cartesian functors.

Yoneda lemma

Let F be a groupoid on a space X, and U an open set on X. Let (U,F) denote the category of groupoid morphisms U  →  F, where we let U also denote the groupoid canonically associated to the space U.

Define a functor u:(U,F)  →  F(U) as follows:

Objects: Let f:U  →  F be a groupoid morphism (i.e., an object of (U,F)). Define

Morphisms: Let η:f  ⇒  g be a natural transformation (i.e., a morphism in (U,F)) between groupoid morphisms f,g:U  →  F. Define

With these definitions, u:(U,F)  →  F(U) is a well-defined functor.

In this section, we shall show that this functor u:(U,F)  →  F(U) is an equivalence of categories. More precisely, we shall explicitly write down a functor v:F(U)  →  (U,F) such that [formula] and [formula].

Define a functor v:F(U)  →  (U,F) as follows.

Objects: Let η∈F(U). Define a groupoid morphism fη:U  →  F as follows:

Objects: First, fη:U  ↦  η, and if [formula] is inclusion of open sets, then fη:V  ↦  ρ*η.

Morphisms: Let [formula] be inclusion of open sets. From the second groupoid axiom, there exists a unique morphism χ12:η|V1  →  η|V2 such that pF(χ12)  =  ρ, and the composition [formula] equals the natural map η|V1  →  η. Define

With these definitions, fη:U  →  F is a well-defined groupoid morphism. Thus, we define (In passing, note that fη is only defined up to isomorphism, because ρ*η is only unique up to unique isomorphism. It is straightforward to check that this implies that our functor v is only defined up to an invertible natural transformation.)

Morphisms: Let η1,η2∈F(U), and g:η1  →  η2 a morphism in F(U). Define a natural transformation :fη1  ⇒  fη2 as follows: for every open V  ⊆  U, define (V):fη1  →  fη2 to be the unique morphism given by the second groupoid axiom such that the following diagram commutes: With this definition, it is straightforward to check that [formula] is a natural transformation. Then, we define

With this definition, v:F(U)  →  (U,F) is a well-defined functor.

Next, in order to show that u:(U,F)  →  F(U) is an equivalence of categories, we need to show that [formula] and [formula]. It is easy to check that [formula].

To show that [formula], we shall construct an invertible natural transformation [formula].

We construct λ as follows. Let f:U  →  F be a groupoid morphism (i.e., an object of (U,F)). Then [formula] is the morphism in (U,F) (i.e., the natural transformation between groupoid morphisms [formula], f) determined as follows. For any inclusion [formula] of open V into U, define to be the unique morphism in F that makes the following diagram commute: (Existence and uniqueness follow from the second groupoid axiom.) Since pF(λ(f)(V))  =  V, the morphism λ(f)(V) is invertible. It is straightforward to check that the λ(f)(V) define a natural transformation [formula], and it is also straightforward that these natural transformations λ(f) themselves define an invertible natural transformation [formula].

Thus, we have that [formula] and [formula], so u and v are equivalences of categories.

As a result of this lemma, we now see that giving an object of F over open U  ⊆  X is equivalent to specifying a groupoid morphism U  →  F.

Fiber products of groupoids

Suppose one has groupoids F1, F2 and G over a space X, together with groupoid morphisms

[formula]

Then we can define the fiber product F1  ×  GF2, as follows.

First, we shall define the category describing F1  ×  GF2. Objects of this category are triples (A1,A2,α), where Ai∈Fi, pF1(A1)  =  pF2(A2), and [formula] an isomorphism in G. Morphisms are defined by pairs (φ1,φ2), where φi:Ai  →  Bi is a morphism in Fi, such that pF1(φ1)  =  pF2(φ2), and [formula].

The projection map p:F1  ×  GF2  →  U is defined as follows.

On objects,

On morphisms,

These definitions yield a well-defined functor p:F1  ×  GF2  →  U.

It is straightforward to check that, with the definitions above, F1  ×  GF2 is a well-defined groupoid over X.

Now, fibered products are assumed to possess a universal property: namely, if H is any other groupoid over X, together with maps h:H  →  F1, k:H  →  F2 such that the diagram commutes, then there exists a unique groupoid morphism r:H  →  F1  ×  GF2 such that [formula] and [formula].

It is straightforward to check that our fibered products do indeed satisfy this universal property. If H, h, and k are above, then define a functor r:H  →  F1  ×  GF2 as follows:

Objects: Let A∈H. Define [formula].

Morphisms: Let λ:A  →  B be a morphism in H. Define [formula].

It is straightforward to check that r possesses the desired properties, and so our fibered products possess the usual universal property.

Presheaves on groupoids

A presheaf on a groupoid F is simply a contravariant functor from F. Note that in the special case the groupoid F is a space (i.e., the category is the category of open sets of some topological space), then this notion of presheaf coincides with the usual notion of presheaf on a space.

Clearly, the intuition here is that the objects of F are open sets, on some sort of generalized space. If the reader thinks deeply about this intuition, they may become somewhat confused about how to define a sheaf, given a presheaf. After all, to define a sheaf, we need to be able to talk about coverings of open sets. Here, because our category F of "open sets" can have more interesting morphisms than in the category of open sets on a standard topological space, it is not quite clear what a covering of an object of F should be.

In the next section we shall speak to this issue. In order to make sense out of the notion of a sheaf, we have to specify some additional information, which somehow captures a notion of "topology" of F. This extra information will be precisely a set of coverings of the objects of F.

Groupoids and sites

Just as the total space of a bundle can itself be understood as a topological space, a groupoid can be understood as a "generalized" topological space. The notion of generalized spaces was introduced by the Grothendieck school [\cite=artingt] [\cite=milne], and basically involves replacing the sets in point-set topology with categories. In particular, a generalized space does not have a set of points, but rather has a category of points. The category of open sets on a generalized space can have more morphisms than just inclusion maps - for example, the open sets can have automorphisms beyond just the identity.

A detailed introduction to the ideas of generalized spaces is beyond the scope of this paper; see instead [\cite=artingt] [\cite=milne] [\cite=mumford1] [\cite=johnstone] [\cite=maclane]. Generalized spaces are typically defined by the category of maps into them (in algebraic geometry this is referred to as working with Grothendieck's functor of points). However, although that approach is quite powerful, it is rather abstract, and considerably more general than we shall need. Thus, in this paper we shall take a slightly different approach.

In practice, one is often only interested in the open sets on a generalized space. The open sets are defined by some category, which one often wants to possess fibered products. Now, one would like to define, for example, sheaves on generalized spaces, for which one needs some notion of a covering of an open set on a generalized space. Since there can be more morphisms between the open sets than just the identity and inclusion maps, and because these morphisms need not be, in any sense, one-to-one in general, to specify a topology on a generalized space one must also specify a set of coverings of each open set, i.e., for each open set η∈F, one must specify sets of other objects and morphisms where all ηα∈F. Again, if our "open sets" were open sets in the usual sense, then the notion of covering would be clear. However, because on a generalized space, the category of open sets can have far more general morphisms, one must carefully define what is meant by a covering. Put another way, because the categorical structure is more complicated, we must specify coverings in order to capture any notion of topology. These coverings are subject to certain consistency conditions, which we shall describe momentarily.

Given knowledge of the open sets and coverings of open sets on a generalized space, one can then, for example, define a sheaf on the generalized space.

We can also think about these matters in an alternative fashion. Given some arbitrary category, we can put a topology on the category by specifying a set of coverings for each object. The objects of the category are thought of as open sets on some generalized space. In particular, in this fashion we can think of a groupoid (together with a set of coverings) as defining a generalized space - the objects of the groupoid are associated with the open sets.

A category together with an appropriate set of coverings of the objects is often known as a site, i.e., a site is a category with a topology. Clearly, as a groupoid is itself described by a category, we can put a topology on the groupoid (i.e., define a set of coverings), and make it a site. Not all sites come from groupoids, however.

A few comments on notation are now in order. The term site refers to any category with a set of coverings (i.e., a topology), and indeed occasionally sites are themselves thought of as describing categories of open sets on some generalized space [\cite=johnstone] [\cite=maclane]. In practice, however, the categorical structure of a site can be extremely complicated, and so one typically only refers to those sites coming from groupoids as generalized spaces.

In particular, not all sites have an easy understanding in terms of traditional notions of spaces. For example, in algebraic geometry one common site is the site of schemes relative to some scheme S, denoted Sch / S. The objects of this site are schemes (together with maps into the scheme S), and the set of coverings is determined by the appropriate context. This particular site is quite common in moduli problems in algebraic geometry, whose solutions are often stated in terms of sheaves on this site.

Now that we have given an introductory picture of generalized spaces and sites (i.e., topological categories), we shall discuss more technical definitions. Let F be some category, which we wish to interpret as the category of open sets on a generalized space. (F might be a groupoid fibered over some other space, for example.)

Using the definition in [\cite=artingt] [\cite=mumford1], the category F of open sets and the coverings are required to obey the following axioms:

Fibered products η1  ×  ξη2 of objects of F exist.

{f:η'  →  η} is a covering if f is an isomorphism. If {fα:ηα  →  η} is a covering and if, for all α, is a covering, then the whole collection is a covering.

If {fα:ηα  →  η} is a covering and g:ξ  →  η is any morphism, then is a covering, where π1 denotes the projection onto the first factor.

Next, we shall specialize to the case that F is a groupoid, and we shall show how one can naturally put a topology on a groupoid. First, we shall check that groupoids admit fibered products. Then, we shall point out a natural notion of covering on a groupoid over X, and check that this notion of covering satisfies the remaining axioms.

Groupoids admit fibered products

Let x,y,z∈F, where F is a groupoid, and let qx:x  →  z, qy:y  →  z be morphisms in F. We shall first show that there exists an object, which we shall denote x  ×  zy, together with morphisms

[formula]

such that the following diagram commutes:

Define Ux  =  pF(x), Uy  =  pF(y), and [formula]. Define [formula], and let πx:x  ×  zy  →  x be the canonical inclusion map. Let πy:x  ×  zy  →  y be the unique morphism such that [formula] (whose existence and uniqueness are guaranteed by the second groupoid axiom). We now have the desired object x  ×  zy.

We still need to check that the object x  ×  zy has the desired universality property. Let w∈F, together with morphisms u:w  →  x, v:w  →  y such that the diagram commutes. We shall now demonstrate the existence of a unique morphism t:w  →  x  ×  zy such that [formula] and [formula].

Define Uw  =  pF(w). Since there are morphisms w  →  x and w  →  y, we know that [formula]. Define [formula].

From the second groupoid axoim, there exists a unique morphism t1:w  →  x  ×  zy such that pF(t1)  =  h, and [formula]. Similarly, there exists a unique morphism t2:w  →  x  ×  zy such that pF(t2)  =  h and [formula].

Finally, again from the second groupoid axiom, there exists a unique morphism t:w  →  x  ×  zy such that pF(t)  =  h and [formula]. But we also know that t1 satisfies the same hypothesis, hence by uniqueness, t  =  t1. Using the facts that [formula] and [formula], one also finds from uniqueness that t  =  t2.

Hence, we have a morphism t:w  →  x  ×  zy with the desired commutivity properties, and so our fibered product x  ×  zy does indeed possess the necessary universality property. Thus, groupoids admit fibered products.

Coverings for groupoids

A natural notion of covering for a groupoid F is as follows. Define a collection of maps {fα:ηα  →  η} to be a covering of η∈F, precisely when the collection of open sets {pF(ηα)} defines a covering (in X) of the open set pF(η)  ⊆  X.

Then, the axioms for a set of coverings to define a topology are trivial to check.

First, {g:η'  →  η} will define a covering precisely when pF(η')  =  pF(η), i.e., precisely when g is an isomorphism.

Next, suppose {fα:ηα  →  η} is a covering and, for all α, {fαβ:ηα,β  →  ηα} is a covering also. Then certainly {pF(ηα,β)} is an open cover of pF(η)  ⊆  X, so the whole collection is a covering.

Finally, suppose that {fα:ηα  →  η} is a covering, and g:ξ  →  η is any morphism. Then pF(ξ)  ⊆  pF(η), so [formula] is an open cover of pF(ξ), hence is a covering.

Stacks

Now that we have discussed groupoids, we shall discuss under what circumstances groupoids are stacks.

As noted earlier, a groupoid is equivalent to a prestack. So, a stack is merely a special groupoid, one satisfying certain gluing axioms.

In particular, a stack is a groupoid that satisifes two gluing axioms:

Gluing for morphisms: The presheaf U(x,y) of sets must be a sheaf of sets, for every open U  ⊆  X and every x,y∈F(U).

Gluing for objects: Let U be any open set in X, and {Uα} any open cover of U. Let {xα∈F(Uα)} be a family of objects over the elements of {Uα}, and let [formula] be a family of isomorphisms between the restrictions of the {xα}. Assume that φαα  =  , and that the following diagram commutes: where unmarked arrows are canonical. (Briefly, "[formula].") There there must exist x∈F(U) together with isomorphisms ψα:x|α  →  xα such that the following diagram commutes: where unmarked arrows are canonical. (Briefly, "[formula].")

It is straightforward to check that if a groupoid satisfies these axioms, then an associated prestack satisfies the axioms of [\cite=dt2] to be a stack. Also, conversely, given a prestack that happens to be a stack, the associated groupoid satisfies the axioms to be a stack.

Sheaves on stacks

Presheaves on groupoids

Before studying sheaves on stacks, we shall warm up by considering presheaves on groupoids. Just as a presheaf of, say, sets, on a space X is a contravariant functor from the category of open sets to [formula], a presheaf of sets on a groupoid F over X [\cite=mumford1] is a contravariant functor from F to [formula].

Sheaves on topological groupoids

In addition to presheaves, we can also define sheaves on groupoids. Now, a sheaf differs from a presheaf through possessing a glueing property, which is phrased in terms of open covers. So, in order to talk about sheaves on groupoids, one must choose a set of coverings - one must put a topology on the groupoid.

Let us assume a topology has been chosen on a groupoid F over X. Let S be a presheaf on F. Then, S is a sheaf, not just a presheaf, if [\cite=mumford1] for all objects η∈F, and for all covers [formula] of η, if {sα∈S(ηα)} is a family of elements such that (where ρααβ, ρβαβ are the projection maps ηα  ×  ηηβ  →  ηα,ηβ), then there exists a unique s∈S(η) such that ρ*αs  =  sα.

More briefly, the gluing condition for a presheaf to be a sheaf over a groupoid is precisely analogous to the usual gluing condition.

D-brane "bundles"

As is well-known, on the worldvolume of N coincident D-branes, there is a U(N) bundle. However, in the presence of a nontrivial B field, this story is slightly modified. Specifically, if we describe a nontrivial B field in terms of local coordinate data (Bα,Aαβ,hαβγ) (as described in, for example, [\cite=hitchin]) then the transition functions gαβ for the "bundle" obey (where I is the N  ×  N identity matrix) on triple overlaps [\cite=freeded].

Such twisted bundles can be described in terms of certain sheaves on stacks. In particular, just as gauge fields are naturally understood in terms of connections on bundles, B fields are naturally understood in terms of connections on gerbes, which are special kinds of stacks. This is described in more detail in, for example, [\cite=brylinski] [\cite=dt2]; we shall not repeat the story here, but shall instead assume the reader is acquainted with it.

Before describing how D-brane "bundles" are certain sheaves on stacks, we shall first briefly review how one finds hαβγ in terms of stacks. Let F be a stack which happens to be a gerbe, and let {Uα} be a good open cover over X, and let {ηα∈F(Uα)} be a collection of objects lying over elements of the open cover. Let [formula] be a collection of isomorphisms. (For a stack which is a gerbe, all objects lying over a contractible open set are isomorphic.) Let [formula] be associated isomorphisms, as described in [\cite=dt2]. Then, (For a stack which is a gerbe, and in particular a gerbe with band C∞(U(1)), automorphisms of objects over U are in 1-1 correspondence with elements of C∞(U,U(1)).)

Now, consider sheaves S on F of the following form. First, for all open U  ⊆  X, for all objects η∈F(U), let S(η) be either empty or C∞(U,U(N)). Second, if φ is an automorphism of η, isomorphic to some element of C∞(U,U(1)) which we shall also denote by φ, then S(φ) acts on S(η) by multiplying by [formula], where I is the N  ×  N identity matrix.

Next, we shall check that for a sheaf on F of this form, transition functions are twisted on triple overlaps just as for "bundles" on D-branes.

Let {sα∈S(ηα)} be a collection of local sections. Define

[formula]

On triple overlaps, it is straightforward to calculate that where I is the N  ×  N identity matrix.

Conclusions

In this paper, we have explicitly observed that the twisted "bundles" on D-branes can be understood in terms of sheaves on stacks. We have also taken this opportunity to provide a readable overview of stacks and generalized spaces, in order to aid the reader in grappling with the notion of a sheaf on a stack.

Since the twisted "bundle" can be equivalently understood as an ordinary bundle on a stack, one is led to ask some interesting questions about string compactifications and these generalized spaces. For example, to what extent can one compactify strings on generalized spaces? Can "turning on the B field" be equivalently understood as compactifying on a generalized space? We hope to answer these questions in future work.

Ben-Zvi for originally insisting to us that it should be possible to understand the twisted "bundles" on D-branes in terms of sheaves on stacks, and for useful comments on a rough draft. We would also like to thank P. Aspinwall, A. Knutson, D. Morrison, and R. Plesser for useful conversations.

Equivalence of groupoids and prestacks

In this appendix we shall show that the notion of groupoid is equivalent to the notion of prestack as defined in [\cite=dt2] (with the extra hypothesis on prestacks that all morphisms are invertible).

Prestacks are groupoids

Next, we shall show that this notion of a groupoid over a space is almost identical to the notion of a prestack on a space as defined in [\cite=dt2].

Let C be a prestack (or presheaf of categories) on a space X, as defined in [\cite=dt2]. We shall also assume that for every open set U  ⊆  X, all of the morphisms in the category C(U) are invertible. (This is one of the axioms appearing in the definition of gerbe in [\cite=dt2].) This additional axiom will only be needed to prove the second groupoid axiom.

In order to derive a groupoid from this prestack C, we first need to find a category F and a functor pF:F  →  C, and then demonstrate that F and pF satisfy the appropriate axioms.

Define F as follows.

Objects of F are pairs (U,ξ) where ξ∈C(U), U∈U.

A morphism (U,ξ)  →  (V,ζ) is a pair of maps (ρ,f), where [formula] and f:ξ  →  ρ*ζ is a morphism in C(U).

Given two morphisms

[formula]

we define their composition to be where φ is the invertible natural transformation appearing in the definition of prestack. It can be shown that this composition is associative.

Define the functor pF:F  →  U as follows.

On objects, pF((U,ξ))  =  U

On morphisms, pF((ρ,f))  =  ρ

It can be shown that with these definitions of F and pF, the two axioms for a groupoid are satisfied. (In order to show the second axiom for a groupoid, we must use the assumption that all morphisms in C are invertible.)

Groupoids are prestacks

Let F be a groupoid over a space X. We shall now show how F defines a prestack C on X.

First, for any open set U  ⊆  X, define C(U)  =  F(U). (Note that this means that all morphisms in C are invertible, a slightly stronger condition than needed for a prestack.)

Next, for each inclusion [formula] of open sets, define a functor ρ*:C(U)  →  C(V) as follows.

Objects: Let x∈C(U). Define ρ*x to be x|V.

Morphisms: Let x,y∈C(U), and f:x  →  y a morphism in C(U). Let gx:x|V  →  x, gy:y|V  →  y denote the canonical maps. Then by the second groupoid axiom, there exists a unique morphism, call it ρ*f, mapping x|V  →  y|V, such that the following diagram commutes:

It is straightforward to check that with these definitions, ρ*:C(U)  →  C(V) is a well-defined functor.

Finally, for each pair [formula], [formula] of composable inclusions of open sets, we define an invertible natural transformation as follows. Let x∈C(U1), and let

[formula]

be the canonical maps. Then, define φ(x):x|U3  →  x|U2|U3 is defined to be the unique morphism that makes the following diagram commute: (whose existence is guaranteed by the second groupoid axiom). It is straightforward to check that with the definition above, φ is a natural transformation, and moreover satisfies the condition that for any three composable inclusions, the following diagram commutes:

With the definitions above, the set of data (C(U),ρ*,φ) defines a prestack.

The attentive reader will correctly note that we have not uniquely defined a prestack from a groupoid, as the object x|U is only defined up to unique isomorphism. However, it is straightforward to check that any two prestacks obtained from the same groupoid, and differing only in the precise choices of x|U, are isomorphic. Specifically, let C1 and C2 denote two prestacks obtained from the same groupoid F on X, and differing as above. Define a Cartesian functor F:C1  →  C2 as follows. For any open U, since C1(U)  =  C2(U)  =  F(U), define F(U) to be the identity functor. Then, for any inclusion [formula], define a natural transformation χρ as follows. For any x∈C1(U), define χρ(x) to be the unique map ρ*C2(x)  →  ρ*C1(x) such that the following diagram commutes: where the unmarked arrows are canonical. (Existence and uniqueness follow from the second groupoid axiom.) It is straightforward to check that χρ is a natural transformation. It is also straightforward to check that for any pair [formula], [formula] of composable inclusions of open sets, the following diagram commutes: In other words, the natural transformations χρ are compatible with the functors F(U), and so (F,χρ) defines a Cartesian functor (in the sense of [\cite=dt2]). Clearly, this Cartesian functor defines an equivalence of the prestacks C1 and C2.

Cartesian functors and morphisms of groupoids

Recall that a morphism of groupoids F  →  G over a space X is defined to be a functor F:F  →  G such that [formula], i.e., commutes.

A Cartesian functor between prestacks, as defined in [\cite=dt2], defines a morphism between the associated groupoids, as we shall now demonstrate.

Let C, D be two prestacks (as defined in [\cite=dt2]), subject to the additional constraint that all morphisms in all categories C(U) and D(U) are invertible. Let (F,χ):C  →  D be a Cartesian functor. Define a functor F:F  →  G as follows:

Objects: Let (U,ξ)∈F, i.e., ξ∈C(U). Define

Morphisms: Let (ρ,f):(U,ξ)  →  (V,ζ), i.e., f:ξ  →  ζ|U. Define

It can be shown that the functor F is well-defined, and moreover [formula].

Conversely, let f:F  →  G be a morphism of groupoids over X, and let C, D denote prestacks associated to F, G, respectively. Define a Cartesian functor (F,χρ):C  →  D as follows:

For every open set U  ⊆  X, the functor F(U):C(U)  →  D(U) is induced by f, as C(U)  =  F(U) and D(U)  =  G(U).

Let [formula] be an inclusion of open sets in X. For any x∈F(U), define χρ(x) to be the unique morphism that makes the following diagram commute: where unmarked arrows are (images of) canonical maps. (Existence and uniqueness follow from the second groupoid axiom.) It is straightforward to check that this defines a natural transformation [formula], and moreover that this natural transformation makes (F,χρ) into a Cartesian functor.

Natural transformations and 2-arrows

In the previous section, we argued that a Cartesian functor F:C  →  D between prestacks (in the sense of [\cite=dt2]) defines a groupoid morphism between the groupoids F, G associated to C and D, respectively. In this section we shall point out that a 2-arrow Ψ:F  →  G (defined as in [\cite=dt2]) between Cartesian functors F,G:C  →  D defines a natural transformation η:F  →  G between the associated groupoid morphisms.

Let (U,ξ)∈F, i.e., ξ∈C(U). Then, we define the natural transformation η by

It is straightforward to check that η is a well-defined natural transformation.

Conversely, let f,g:F  →  G be a pair of morphisms of groupoids over X, and let η:f  ⇒  g be a natural transformation relating them. Let C, D be prestacks associated to F, G, and let F,G:C  →  D be Cartesian functors associated to f, g, respectively. We shall now define a 2-arrow Ψ:F  ⇒  G, in the sense of [\cite=dt2].

For any open set U, recall that the functors F(U) and G(U) are induced directly from f and g. Clearly, η induces a natural transformation Ψ(U):F(U)  ⇒  G(U). Also, for any inclusion [formula] of open sets, it is straightforward to check that the following diagram commutes: Thus, we have defined a 2-arrow Ψ:F  ⇒  G.
