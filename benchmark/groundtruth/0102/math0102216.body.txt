Introduction

In ergodic theory one of the main theorems on entropy is the McMillan theorem, also called the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem. In one form it states that if (X,μ) is a probability space and T a measure preserving ergodic transformation, then for any finite measurable partition ξ and any ε > 0 there exists n0 such that if n  ≥  n0 then outside of a union of atoms of total measure <  ε every atom in [formula] has measure in the interval (e- n(H(T;ξ) + ε),e- n(H(T;ξ) - ε)).

In the present paper we shall give a non-commutative extension of the McMillan theorem. Our setting will be asymptotically abelian C*-dynamical systems with locality (A,τ,α) [\cite=NS], where we assume τ is an invariant ergodic trace. If N is a local subalgebra of A which is a mean generator [\cite=GS2], i.e. the C*-algebra [formula] and [formula], then we shall show that for any ε > 0 and any n sufficiently large their exists a central projection zn in [formula] such that τ(zn) < ε and

[formula]

for any minimal projection e in Nn(1 - zn). The proof is based on ideas in [\cite=NS] and uses the classical McMillan theorem.

The above result forms the main contents of Section [\ref=2]. Then in Section [\ref=3] we study sufficient conditions for a local algebra to be a mean generator. For example, we shall show that if N is a mean generator and M is a C*-algebra contained in [formula] then M is itself a mean generator for the C*-algebra [formula].

The McMillan Theorem

Throughout the paper we consider C*-dynamical systems (A,τ,α) which are asymptotically abelian with locality [\cite=NS], i.e. we assume that there exists a dense α-invariant *  -subalgebra A of A such that for all pairs a,b∈A the C*-algebra they generate is finite dimensional, and there is [formula] such that = 0 for |j|  ≥  p. Recall that by a local algebra we mean a finite dimensional subalgebra of A. We shall assume also that τ is an α-invariant trace.

Suppose the trace τ is ergodic, i.e. is an extremal α-invariant state. Suppose N is a local algebra which is a mean generator and the entropy H(α) is finite, so

[formula]

where [formula]. Then given ε > 0 there exist n0 and central projections zn in Nn such that τ(zn) < ε for n  ≥  n0 and

[formula]

for any minimal projection e in Nn(1 - zn).

Note that since τ is a trace, ergodicity of τ is equivalent to ergodicity of the automorphism α on the weak closure πτ(A)'' of the GNS-representation of A. Note also that we can consider πτ(A) instead of A, and so assume that τ is faithful.

For all examples we know, the assumption on mean generator is always fulfilled. However, we were unable to prove that it is automatic. In the next section we shall discuss several sufficient conditions for a local algebra to be a mean generator.

To prove Theorem [\ref=2.1] we shall need the first part of the following proposition.

Let N be a local algebra, [formula] such that αj(N) commutes with N for |j|  ≥  p. Then

(i) [formula] where [formula]

(ii) [formula] where hcpaτ(Nn - p  ,αn) is Voiculescu's completely positive approximation entropy of αn computed with respect to any finite set spanning Nn - p.

Proof. (i) The proof is similar to [\cite=NS]. Since H(Nn - p  ,αn)  ≤  nH(α|A(N)), it is enough to prove that for any [formula]

[formula]

For this fix m0 and take n  ≥  m + m0 + p and [formula]. Consider the algebra [formula] and define unital completely positive mappings ψ:B  →  A and ρ:A  →  B as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is the τ-preserving conditional expectation. For [formula] and a∈Nm, we have from the proof of [\cite=NS]

[formula]

Let [formula] be the inclusion mapping. Then by [\cite=CNT]

[formula]

where [formula] as m0  →    ∞  . Since αjn(Nn - p) commutes with Nn - p for [formula],

[formula]

Thus letting k  →    ∞   in the above inequality we get

[formula]

and the proof is complete.

(ii) This part is proved analogously: given (B0,ψ0,ρ0)∈CPA(A,τ) which approximates [formula] we construct (B1,ψ1,ρ1), where B1 = Bm00,

[formula]

[formula]

which approximates [formula].

Since [formula] for finite dimensional C*-algebras M1 and M2 with normalized traces τ1 and τ2 respectively, we have

For systems which are asymptotically abelian with locality the tensor product formula for the entropy with respect to tracial states holds.

Let {Mn}n be a sequence of finite dimensional C*-algebras, h a non-negative number, ε > 0. We shall say that the McMillan theorem holds for {Mn}n, h and ε, if the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=2.1] holds for Mn instead of Nn, and h instead of H(α). So there exist n0 and central projections zn in Mn such that τ(zn) < ε for n  ≥  n0 and

[formula]

for any minimal projection e in Mn(1 - zn).

For any ε > 0 there exists ε1 > 0 such that if {ξn}n and {ζn}n are sequences of finite partitions of a Lebesgue space (X,μ), [formula], [formula], [formula], |h - h1| < ε1 and the McMillan theorem holds for {ζn}n, h1 and ε1, then it holds also for {ξn}n, h and ε.

Proof. Let {Cni}i∈Xn be the atoms of ξn, {Dnj}j∈Yn the atoms of ζn. Let n be the set of j∈Yn for which

[formula]

For n large enough

[formula]

or

[formula]

For i∈Xn let j(i) be a unique index such that Cni  ⊂  Dnj(i). Let

[formula]

By virtue of ([\ref=e2.1])

[formula]

Hence, for n large enough,

[formula]

For i∈n

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus we can take ε1 such that [formula].

Let {ξn}n be an increasing sequence of finite partitions of a Lebesgue space (X,μ), ζ a finite partition such that [formula]. Suppose the McMillan theorem holds for [formula], h and ε. Then it holds also for {ξn}n, h and 2ε.

Proof. Let {Cni}i∈Xn be the atoms of ξn, {Dj}j∈Y the atoms of ζ. Let

[formula]

We assert that

[formula]

Indeed, otherwise there exist j∈Y and c > 0 such that

[formula]

for infinitely many n's. In other words, the set [formula] has measure μ(En)  ≥  c, and for the conditional expectation E(Dj|ξn) of the characteristic function of the set Dj with respect to the partition ξn we have

[formula]

which contradicts the a.e. convergence of {E(Dj|ξn)}n to the characteristic function of Dj.

Now let Zn be the set of pairs (i,j) such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

For i∈n

[formula]

and for n large enough

[formula]

Since for large n

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have also

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=2.1]. Let Cn be a masa in Nn. We may suppose that Cn  ⊂  Cn + 1. Then we have to prove that the McMillan theorem holds for {Cn}n, H(α) and any ε > 0 (note that if a projection zn' is chosen in Cn as in the statement of the McMillan theorem then we can replace 1 - zn' by its central support pn in Nn and let zn  =  1 - pn).

Using Proposition [\ref=2.2](i) choose [formula] such that

[formula]

where ε1 is as in Lemma [\ref=2.4]. Let Am be the von Neumann subalgebra of πτ(A)'' generated by αjm(Nm - p), [formula], D a masa in Nm - p. Then [formula] is a masa in [formula]. If αm was ergodic, we could apply the classical McMillan theorem to {Dn}n and then make use of Lemma [\ref=2.4] to conclude that it holds also for {Cn}n. Since αm can be non-ergodic, consider the fixed point algebra Z  ⊂  πτ(A)'' with respect to αm. Since α is asymptotically abelian and ergodic on πτ(A)'', Z is a finite dimensional subalgebra of the center of πτ(A)''. Let {zi}i∈X be the atoms of Z. The automorphism α acts transitively on the set of atoms, so the systems (Azi,τi,αm|Azi) are pairwise conjugate, where τi = |X|τ|Azi and |X| denotes the cardinality of X. Since [formula], we conclude that H(αm|Azi) = mH(α), so for [formula] we have

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

Thus if   =  {i∈X | Hi > H(α) - ε1} then

[formula]

whence

[formula]

We have also

[formula]

and

[formula]

so

[formula]

For any i∈X the automorphism αm is ergodic on Azi, so by the classical result the McMillan theorem holds for {Dnzi}n, Hi and ε1. Then by Lemma [\ref=2.4], for i∈, it holds for {Cnzi}n, H(α) and ε (with respect to the trace τi). By virtue of ([\ref=e2.2]) it holds also for [formula], H(α) and 2ε. Finally, by Lemma [\ref=2.5] the McMillan theorem holds for {Cn}n, H(α) and 4ε.

The method used in the proof can be applied to prove the following weak form of the McMillan theorem under more general assumptions.

Let (A,τ,α) be an asymptotically abelian system with locality, and τ an ergodic trace. Then the entropy H(α) of Connes and Størmer of the system coincides with Voiculescu's completely positive approximation entropy hcpaτ(α).

Proof. Let N be a local subalgebra of A. It suffices to prove that hcpaτ(N,α)  ≤  H(α). Then by Proposition [\ref=2.2](ii) it is enough to prove that hcpaτ(Nm - p  ,αm)  ≤  mH(α). Keep the notations of the proof of Theorem [\ref=2.1]. By the classical McMillan theorem we have hcpaτi(Nm - pzi  ,αm) = H(Nm - pzi  ,αm) (see the proof of [\cite=V]). Since H(Nm - pzi  ,αm)  ≤  H(αm|Azi) = mH(α) and

[formula]

we obtain the desired inequality.

(i) The assumption that N is a mean generator in Theorem [\ref=2.1] is very close to being necessary. Indeed, suppose N satisfies the conclusion of Theorem. Then

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

so

[formula]

In particular, if the Nn's don't grow too fast, e.g. if rank  Nn  ≤  eCn for some C > 0, then

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

(ii) It is not clear what the optimal assumptions are for Theorem [\ref=2.1] to be true. The conclusion holds in several cases when the dynamical system is not asymptotically abelian. Such an example is that of a binary shift, see [\cite=PP]. Then we are given a subset X of [formula] and the algebra A(X) generated by symmetries [formula] satisfying commutation relations

[formula]

The binary shift is the automorphism α defined by α(sn) = sn + 1. Let [formula]. Then [formula], where Zn is the diagonal in [formula], n = 2dn + cn, and thus any minimal projection in An has trace 2- dn - cn. We show that the following three conditions are equivalent. By [\cite=GS1] they are satisfied not only for asymptotically abelian systems.

(i) The conclusion of Theorem [\ref=2.1] holds for each algebra An (instead of N).

(ii) [formula] and [formula].

(iii) [formula].

Indeed, the implication (i)⇒  (iii) follows from the previous remark.

Since [formula], see e.g. [\cite=GS2], (iii) implies [formula], hence by [\cite=GS2], [formula]. Thus (iii)⇒  (ii).

If (ii) holds then [formula], and so (ii) implies (i).

Mean Generators

In this section we discuss several sufficient conditions for a local algebra to be a mean generator.

Our first result shows that it is enough to prove that at least one algebra is a mean generator.

If N is a mean generator for A(N), H(α|A(N)) <   ∞   and M is a subalgebra of [formula] for some n, then M is a mean generator for A(M).

Proof. Without loss of generality we may suppose that M  ⊂  N. As above, let p be such that αj(N) commutes with N for |j|  ≥  p. Let Dn be a masa in Mn - p, Cn a masa in Nn - p containing Dn. We have

[formula]

Since [formula] by assumption and Proposition [\ref=2.2], we conclude that

[formula]

hence M is a mean generator.

We have used in the proof that if H(α|A(N)) <   ∞   then N is a mean generator if and only if

[formula]

Using the following lemma we shall show that it suffices to check this condition using any subalgebra of Nn containing the center Z(Nn) instead of Nn.

Let [formula] be commuting finite dimensional algebras, Z(Mi)  ⊂  Ai  ⊂  Mi. Then

[formula]

Proof. It suffices to consider the case n = 2. Let {ei}i be the atoms of a masa in A1, {fj}j the atoms of a masa in A2. Let (M1)ei be a factor of type Imi, (M2)fj a factor of type Inj. Then

[formula]

Let N be a local algebra such that H(α|A(N)) <   ∞  . Let {Mn}n be a sequence of algebras such that Z(Nn - p)  ⊂  Mn  ⊂  Nn - p. Then N is a mean generator for A(N) if and only if

[formula]

In particular, N is a mean generator if [formula].

Proof. For any [formula], by Lemma [\ref=3.2]

[formula]

hence

[formula]

what gives the result.

Finally, recall the following simple condition (see e.g. [\cite=Ch]).

Let N be a local algebra. Suppose there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

for any [formula] and [formula]. Then N is a mean generator for A(N).

The last condition shows that Theorem [\ref=2.1] can be applied to asymptotically abelian binary shifts and canonical shifts on towers of relative commutants. On the other hand, Proposition [\ref=3.1] allows to apply Theorem [\ref=2.1] to systems arising from topological dynamics, which were considered in [\cite=NS]. Indeed, if a local algebra has a masa lying in the diagonal then it is a mean generator since all computations are reduced to the abelian case. Then Proposition [\ref=3.1] shows that any local algebra is a mean generator.
