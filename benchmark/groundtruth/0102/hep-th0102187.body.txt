Abstract

Anisotropic cosmological spacetimes are constructed from spherically symmetric solutions to Einstein's equations coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics and a positive cosmological constant. This is accomplished by finding solutions in which the roles of r and t are interchanged for all r > 0 (i.e. r becomes timelike and t becomes spacelike). Constant time hypersurfaces have topology R  ×  S2 and in all the spacetimes considered the radius of the two sphere vanishes as t goes to zero. The scale factor of the other dimension diverges as t goes to zero in some solutions and vanishes (or goes to a constant) in other solutions. At late times local observers would see the universe to be homogeneous and isotropic.

Introduction

Over the last few years Born-Infeld theory [\cite=Bo1] has undergone a revival due to its appearance in string theory [\cite=Po1]. In this paper some exact cosmological solutions are found to the Einstein field equations coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics and a positive cosmological constant. These solutions are constructed from spherically symmetric solutions with gtt = 1 / grr =  - (1 - 2m(r) / r). If [formula] for 0 < r <   ∞   then r and t interchange roles and the solutions describe cosmological spacetimes with a singularity at t = 0 (instead of at r = 0). Constant time hypersurfaces have topology R  ×  S2 and the radius of the two sphere goes to zero as t goes to zero. The scale factor of the other dimension diverges as t goes to zero in some solutions and vanishes (or goes to a constant) in other solutions. The Schwarzschild solution with a cosmological constant leads to a cosmological solution as does Born-Infeld theory. However, Maxwell's theory does not as it is not possible to satisfy [formula] for all r on (0,  ∞  ). Some other Born-infeld cosmologies can be found in [\cite=Gi1] [\cite=Ga1].

Born-Infeld Theory

In nonlinear electrodynamics the Maxwell Lagrangian

[formula]

is replaced by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], F*μν is the dual of Fμν, and L is any function that reduces to ([\ref=Maxwell]) in the weak field limit. Born and Infeld took L to be given by

[formula]

For the solutions considered in this paper [formula] so that G2 = 0. Thus, all G2 dependences will be dropped.

The field equations are

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

The energy-momentum tensor is

[formula]

and the "Hamiltonian", which is a function of Pμν, is

[formula]

For the Born-Infeld Lagrangian

[formula]

and

[formula]

where P2 =  - 2PαβPαβ.

Cosmologies from Spherically Symmetric Solutions

Birkhoff's theorem holds for nonlinear electrodynamic theories and the general spherically symmetric solution is [\cite=Ho1] [\cite=Ho2] [\cite=Ho3] [\cite=Pe1] [\cite=De1] [\cite=Wi1] [\cite=Ol1]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

where P2 = Q2 / r4 and Λ is the cosmological constant.

If [formula] for 0 < r <   ∞   then r is a timelike coordinate and t is a spacelike coordinate. Relabeling r and t and denoting the spacelike variable by x gives

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Constant timelike surfaces have topology R  ×  S2 and the two sphere has radius t. The Ricci scalar is given by

[formula]

and R generically diverges as t goes to zero.

Equation ([\ref=mdot]) can be written as

[formula]

Integrating gives

[formula]

where m0 is a constant. It is important to remember that the constraint

[formula]

must be satisfied for all t > 0.

First consider the case Q = 0 and take H(0) = 0. The constraint becomes

[formula]

This will be satisfied if Λ > 0 and [formula]. Even though R remains finite as t goes to zero the scalar RμναβRμναβ diverges, so that t = 0 is an initial singularity. Thus, Schwarzschild with a positive cosmological constant can be converted into a cosmological solution with metric

[formula]

As t  →  0 the two sphere collapses but the x direction blows up. For large t the metric is

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Thus, at late times we have inflationary behaviour and the scale factor of the two sphere is the same as the scale factor for the x direction.

Next consider Maxwell's theory with H(P2) = 1 / 2P2 = Q2 / 2t4. The constraint is

[formula]

which cannot be satisfied for all t > 0. The problem is that the Q2 term diverges faster than the m0 term and has the wrong sign. This can be modified in nonlinear electrodynamics by including a more divergent term with the correct sign or by eliminating the divergence. If Maxwell's theory is modified so that [formula], the constraint becomes

[formula]

This inequality is satisfied for a wide range of values of the parameters m0,Q,Λ, and α. Here the additional term diverges more rapidly than the Maxwell term and has the correct sign. This spacetime behaves in a similar fashion to the case with Q = 0.

Finally consider the Born-Infeld Lagrangian. The constraint is

[formula]

Since the integral is greater than zero for all t > 0 the inequality will certainly be satisfied if [formula]. In Born-Infeld theory the electric contribution remains finite and does not present a problem as t goes to zero. For m0 > 0 this spacetime has similar properties to the case with Q = 0. It is possible to take m0 = 0. For small t

[formula]

Thus, we require that |Q|  ≥  a / 8π. Now let f(t) = t(2m(t) / t - 1). The derivative of f(t) is given by

[formula]

If Λ  ≥  8π / a2 and |Q|  ≥  a / 8π then f'(t) > 0 for t > 0 and 2m(t) / t - 1 > 0 for t > 0.

Equation ([\ref=3]) determines the spacetime metric given H(P2). The reverse process is also possible. For a metric of the form

[formula]

the Hamiltonian is given by

[formula]

To be physically reasonable H must reduce to the Maxwell Hamiltonian in the weak field limit.

Conclusion

Exact cosmological solutions to the Einstein field equations coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, including Born-Infeld theory, were constructed. These solution were produced by considering spherically symmetric solutions in which the roles of r and t are reversed. These spacetimes have an initial singularity and constant time hypersurfaces have topology R  ×  S2. The radius of the two sphere is t and the scale factor of the other dimension diverges in some cases as t goes to zero and vanishes (or goes to a constant) in other cases. At late times local observers would see the universe to be homogeneous and isotropic. Such solutions can be constructed from the Schwarzschild solution with a positive cosmological constant and from Born-Infeld theory. Maxwell theory does not lead to a cosmological solution because the roles of r and t cannot be reversed for all r > 0.
