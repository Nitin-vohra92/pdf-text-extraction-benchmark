BOUNDS ON THE NODAL STATUSES OF SOME TRANSFINITE GRAPHS

Abstract -- The bounds on the statuses of the nodes in a finite graph established by Entringer, Jackson, and Snyder are extended herein so that they apply to the statuses of the nodes in transfinite graphs of a certain kind.

Key Words: Statuses in graphs, transfinite generalization of status, distances in transfinite graphs.

Introduction

The purpose of this note is to extend the known bounds on the statuses of the nodes of a finite graph to nodes in transfinite graphs of a certain kind. That known result was established by Entringer, Jackson, and Snyder [\cite=ejs]. It states that the status s(x) of any node x in a finite connected graph G having p nodes and q branches satisfies the inequalities

[formula]

and that these bounds can be achieved for each q such that (p - 1)    ≤  q    ≤    p(p - 1) / 2. A modification of this result holds for transfinite graphs satisfying certain conditions.

Some Preliminary Definitions and Known Results

We shall use some definitions and symbolism appearing in [\cite=b8]. Also, we restrict our attention to transfinite graphs Gμ of rank μ, where for the sake of some simplicity we restrict μ to the positive natural numbers. The rather complicated recursive definitions of such μ-graphs appear in Section 2.4 of [\cite=b8]. All our arguments extend readily to graphs of higher ranks, that is, the transfinite-ordinal ranks. Since the distance from any nonmaximal node z is the same as the distance from any node of higher rank containing z, we can restrict our attention to the maximal nodes in Gμ, that is, to the nodes that are not contained in any node of higher rank. This is understood henceforth.

Transfinite nodes are defined in terms of tips (i.e., graphical extremities), which in turn are equivalence classes of one-ended paths, as stated in [\cite=b8]. The μ-nodes in Gμ are the nodes of highest rank in Gμ. A μ-node is said to be pristine if it does not contain a node of lower rank; We will assume that all the μ-nodes are pristine. Also, a node xρ of any rank ρ (ρ  ≤  μ) is called a nonsingleton if it contains at least two elements (either two (μ - 1)-tips of a (μ - 1)-tip and a node of rank lower than ρ).

Furthermore, two branches are said to be ρ-connected if there is a path of rank ρ or less that terminates at nodes of those branches. Actually, such path-connectedness need not exist between all pairs of branches. To insure that such path-connectedness does exist, we impose the following Condition A [\cite=b8]. We say that two tips are nondisconnectable if their representative paths meet infinitely often [\cite=b8]. Also, a node is said to embrace a tip if that tip is part of that node (see [\cite=b8] for the precise definition).

Condition A. If two tips are nondisconnectable, then either they are contained in the same node or at least one of them is the sole member of a maximal node.

Under this condition, for any two nonsingleton nodes there will be a path that terminates at them [\cite=b8], and moreover such path connectedness is a transitive binary relation for the nonsingleton nodes of Gμ; in fact, it is an equivalence relation [\cite=b8].

Throughout this work we assume that Gμ is μ-connected in the sense that every pair of branches are ρ-connected for some rank ρ  ≤  μ depending on the choice of those branches. As a result, the set of branches in Gμ is partitioned into subsets according to (μ - 1)-connectedness, and the subgraph of rank μ - 1 induced by such a subset is called a (μ - 1)-section [\cite=b8]. Because we are assuming that all the μ-nodes are pristine, it follows that every node of rank less than μ is contained within some (μ - 1)-section. Thus, the (μ - 1)-sections also partition the set of nodes of ranks less than μ. We say the a μ-node xμ is incident to a (μ - 1)-section Sμ - 1 if xμ contains a (μ - 1)-tip whose representative paths lie within Sμ - 1. Moreover, if a μ-node is incident to two or more (μ - 1)-sections, it serves as a connection between them.

Lengths of paths and the distances between nodes are defined in [\cite=b8]. By virtue of Condition A, the μ-connectedness of Gμ, and the assumption that all the μ-sections are pristine, we have the following results as a consequence of [\cite=b8]. The length of any path P within a (μ - 1)-section Sμ - 1 that is incident to a ρ-node xρ (ρ  <  μ) in Sμ - 1 and reaches a μ-node xμ incident to Sμ - 1 is ωμ. This is because P can reach xμ only through a (μ - 1)-tip. Consequently, we can define the μ-length of any two-ended path P that reaches or passes through at least one μ-node as ωμ  ·  n, where n is the number of incidences that P makes with μ-nodes; that is, when P terminates at a μ-node, there is one such incidence, and, when P passes through a μ-node from one (μ - 1)-section to another adjacent (μ - 1)-section, there are two such incidences. Furthermore, we define the μ-distance between any two nodes x and y as the minimum of the μ-lengths of all the paths that meet x and y; such a μ-distance exists because those μ-lengths are ordinals and any set of ordinals is well-ordered and therefore has a minimum. It is a fact that under our assumptions there will be a path terminating at x and y whose μ-length is that μ-distance; such a path is called an x,y geodesic.

The μ-Statuses of Nonsingleton Nodes

Even though Gμ is branchwise μ-connected, it can happen that there is no path between two nodes if at least one of them is a singleton, in which case no (path-based) distance will exist between them. However, under Condition A, distances between nonsingleton nodes always exist. For this reason, we shall restrict our definition of nodal statuses to the nonsingleton nodes.

Another convention that we shall adopt in order to extend ([\ref=1.1]) transfinitely is that the distance between any two nodes within a (μ - 1)-section is taken to be 0. Thus, it is only a transition to or from a μ-node that contributes to the length of a geodetic path and thereby to a distance. Without this assumption, the status of a node could be infinite. Also, we shall henceforth assume that the μ-connected μ-graph Gμ has only finitely many nonsingleton μ-nodes and only finitely many (μ - 1)- sections.

To define the μ-status of any nonsingleton node xρ (ρ  ≤  μ), we first choose a single node yαmm (αm  <  μ) for each (μ - 1)-section Sμ - 1m, one such node for each (μ - 1)-section, and designate it as the representative node for Sμ - 1m. Because we have taken the distances between nodes in a single (μ - 1)-section to be 0, we can take the distance from any node in Sμ - 1m to be the same as the distance from the representative node yαmm for Sμ - 1m. Then, we define the μ-status sμ(xρ) as the sum of the distances from xρ to all the nonsingleton μ-nodes plus the sum of the distances to the representative nodes of all the (μ - 1)-sections. In symbols,

[formula]

Here, k numbers the nonsingleton μ-nodes, there being K of them, and m numbers the (μ - 1)-sections, there being M of those. By our assumptions, K and M are natural numbers.

Conditions Imposed upon Gμ

Let us now list all the conditions we have assumed for Gμ.

Also, bear in mind the following considerations.

Note 4.7. We have restricted our attention to only the maximal nodes because the distance from any nonmaximal node is the same as the distance from the maximal node containing it.

Note 4.8. Similarly, we have considered in our analysis only the nonsingleton nodes because the singleton nodes do not contribute to the connectivity of Gμ. On the other hand, as a result of Assumptions 4.2 and 4.3, for any two nonsingleton nodes x and y there is a path terminating at x and y [\cite=b8]. Consequently, a distance is defined between x and y.

In view of all this, the μ-status s(xρ) for any maximal nonsingleton node xρ (ρ  ≤  μ) is well-defined by ([\ref=3.1]).

The Replacement 0-graph

In order to extend ([\ref=1.1]) transfinitely, we replace Gμ by a 0-graph in which the distances in G0 are the same as the μ-distances in Gμ except for a multiplicative factor ωμ. To do this, we adapt the replacement procedure given in [\cite=b8]. Remember that μ  ≥  1, that [formula] numbers the nonsingleton μ-nodes, and that [formula] numbers the (μ - 1)-sections. Now, we replace each nonsingleton μ-node xμk by a 0-node x0k. Furthermore, having chosen a nonsingleton ρm-node yρmm (0  ≤  ρm  ≤  μ - 1) within each (μ - 1)-section, we replace yρmm by a 0-node y0m. (If ρm = 0, no replacement is needed.) Thus, for each m we insert a branch between y0m and each x0k corresponding to a μ-node incident to the (μ - 1)-section Sμ - 1m that contains yρm. In this way, Gμ is replaced by a finite 0-graph consisting of the 0-nodes x0k and y0m [formula] [formula] and of the said branches. In particular, each (μ - 1)-section Sμ - 1m is replaced by a star 0-graph with y0m as its center 0-node and the x0k corresponding to the μ-nodes incident to Sμ - 1m as its peripheral 0-nodes.

Now, to each path P in Gμ there corresponds a unique path Q that passes through the 0-nodes x0k corresponding to the μ-nodes xμk. If one terminal node yρmm (ρm  <  μ) of P lies within a (μ - 1)-section, the path Q terminates correspondingly at the 0-node y0m. On the other hand, if P terminates at a μ-node xμk, then Q terminates at x0k. Furthermore, we define the μ-length |P| of P as ωμ times the number n of incidences that P makes with the μ-nodes, where we count an incidence once of P terminates at a μ-node and we count the incidence twice if P passes through a μ-node. On the other hand, the number of branches in Q is simply n. Thus, the length |Q| of Q is n. As a result of all this, the lengths of P and Q are related as follows:

[formula]

Bounds on the Statuses

In conformity with the way we have defined the μ-lengths of paths in Gμ, we can define the μ-distance between any two nodes in Gμ as ωμ times the distance between the corresponding 0-nodes in G0, where any node within a (μ - 1)-section Sμ - 1m is represented by the node yρmm for Sμ - 1m.

Thus, the μ-status of any node xρ (ρ  ≤  μ) of Gμ, as defined by ([\ref=3.1]), is simply ωμ times the status of the 0-node in G0.

To lift the bounds ([\ref=1.1]) to the transfinite case, we need merely determine the number p of 0-nodes and the number q of branches in G0. Specifically, p is the number of μ-nodes in Gμ plus the number of (μ - 1)-sections in Gμ. With regard to q, note again that each (μ - 1)-section Sμ - 1m has been replaced by a star graph with center at y0m and branches between y0m and every one of the x0k corresponding to the μ-nodes xμk incident to Sμ - 1m. Let δm be the number of such xμk; δm is the degree of y0m. Then,

[formula]

Altogether then, under the assumptions 4.1 to 4.6, we have the desired bounds on the status s(xρ) of any node xρ in Gμ as follows:

[formula]

These bounds can be achieved for each q such that p - 1    ≤    q    ≤    p(p - 1) / 2.

Two Final Comments

7.1. We have restricted our analysis to only the nonsingleton nodes in Gμ. Thus, the μ-status sμ(x) of any such node x is the sum of the distances from x to all (and only) the other nonsingleton μ-nodes and the other representative nonsingleton nodes in the (μ - 1)-sections (one representative node to each (μ - 1)-section. This restriction can be relaxed somewhat by allowing distances from x to include some of the singleton μ-nodes. Specifically, we can also allow a finite number of singleton μ-nodes such that the μ-distances to them from any nonsingleton node exists. Such singleton nodes can occur; see the set M defined in [\cite=b8].

7.2. We can also relax the restriction imposed by assumption 4.2 by taking definitions of entities in the transfinite graph to be based on walks rather than on paths. As a result, two branches that are not connected by a transfinite path may be connected by a transfinite walk, as is explained in [\cite=b8]. Thus, upon assuming that the walk-based transfinite graph Gμ is walk-connected, we can define walk-based distances between any two nodes of Gμ [\cite=b8]. In this case, we can discard assumption 4.3; it is no longer needed. Then, Gμ can be related to a unique 0-graph G0 whereby the μ-distance between nonsingleton walk-based nodes in Gμ is ωμ times the distance between the corresponding 0-nodes in G0. The procedure for doing this is much the same as that presented above. As a result, we again have ([\ref=3.1]) and ([\ref=5.1]), and also ([\ref=1.1]) replaced by ([\ref=6.1]), where sμ(xρ) is now defined as the sum of the walk-based μ-distances from xρ to the walk-based nonsingleton nodes in Gμ. Moreover, finitely many singleton μ-nodes can also be allowed in this case, as is explained in the preceding paragraph 7.1.
