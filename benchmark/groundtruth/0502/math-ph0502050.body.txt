Effective Hamiltonians for atoms in very strong magnetic fields

Introduction

The Pauli Hamiltonian of a non-relativistic atom with an infinitely heavy nucleus and electrons with spin in a constant magnetic field [formula] of strength B is given by:

[formula]

where [formula] are the coordinates of the j-th electron, [formula] is its spin, and [formula] is the gradient with respect to rj. Note that we have made the choice of [formula] for the vector potential of [formula], and that we are working in atomic units.

We fix the direction of [formula] to be the z-direction: [formula] with [formula] without loss of generality. Recall that the z-component of [formula] is given, in the Pauli representation, by

[formula]

acting on the N-fold tensor product [formula]. It is known (see [\cite=KaKu]) that HB: = HB(Z,N) defines an essentially self-adjoint operator on

[formula]

the Hilbert space of distinguishable electrons or "boltzons" (meaning particles satisfying the Boltzman statistics: we thank Beth Ruskai for introducing us to this expression). Physical atoms are of course modeled by HB restricted to the fermionic subspace

[formula]

of totally anti-symmetric wave-functions in [formula], where [formula] stands for exterior product. A useful alternative description of [formula], used in atomic physics, is given by the unitary map

[formula]

the isometry being defined by taking the components of [formula] with respect to the natural basis of [formula] consisting of the products [formula] of the normalized eigenvectors e± of σzj, e- corresponding to "spin down" and e+ to "spin up". In this new representation, σzj acts as the multiplication operator by sj  /  2, and the fermionic subspace [formula] of ([\ref=Boltz]) is simply obtained by anti-symmetrizing with respect to the 4-tuples of variables [formula].

The main results of this paper can be summarized in the following five theorems below. It is worthwhile to observe that HB commutes with each individual spin operator σzj and therefore decomposes in a direct sum which is unitarily equivalent to

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the z component of the total spin operator. So from now on we will consider only [formula] and denote it again by HB. Notice that this operator simply acts in [formula] Since the Hamiltonian HB also commutes with the total angular momentum operator in the field direction, which we will call [formula], we can fix a value [formula] of the latter. Our results will imply that the bottom of the spectrum of HB will necessarily occur for a non-negative value of [formula], and we will therefore restrict ourselves to [formula]. Let [formula] be the restriction of HB to the [formula]-th angular momentum channel (in the field direction), and let [formula] be the orthogonal projection onto the lowest Landau states with z-angular momentum [formula] (cf. ([\ref=Pi-eff]) for the precise definition). We define the effective Hamiltonian [formula] by

[formula]

and let

[formula]

be the projection onto the orthogonal complement (always restricting ourselves to the [formula]-th z-angular momentum channel). The operator [formula] is the first, and most encompassing, of three "effective Hamiltonians" we will consider in this paper. The two other ones, called [formula] and hBδ, will be defined below. It will be convenient to complete [formula] as follows

[formula]

For any self-adjoint operator A, we let σ(A) denote the spectrum of A and ρ(A) its resolvent set. Our first main result is:

Let α  =  α(B) be the unique positive solution of the equation

[formula]

and let [formula]. There exist positive constants Beff, ceff and Ceff, which only depend on Z,N and [formula], such that for all B  ≥  Beff, and all real ξ satisfying

[formula]

we have that [formula], and

[formula]

Some applications of Theorem [\ref=FMT], as well as of Theorems [\ref=SMT], [\ref=CorrSMT], [\ref=FermionizedMThms] and [\ref=ThMT] below, to the study of spectral properties of [formula] are given in the concluding remarks section.

The operator [formula] has the structure of a multi-particle Schrödinger operator on the real line, [formula]:

[formula]

with operator-valued potentials acting point-wise on a certain finite-dimensional Hilbert-space [formula], defined in ([\ref=VBM]) below. Essentially, [formula] is the vector space spanned by the lowest Landau states with angular momentum [formula] . As we will see, [formula] is canonically isomorphic to the space [formula] of vector-valued L2-functions , and the potentials in ([\ref=HsB1]) are simply obtained by projecting the respective Coulomb terms in ([\ref=HB]) along [formula]:

[formula]

We will show that the potentials ([\ref=defVeffietjk]) can be approximated by certain simpler ones, which will give rise to our two other effective Hamiltonians. Define the tempered distribution qB on [formula] by:

[formula]

where

[formula]

(with distributional derivative) is the finite part (in the sense of Hadamard) of the singular function 1 / |z|; (|z|- 1) should be interpreted as a regularization of the (3-dimensional) Coulomb potential restricted to the line. Also introduce (constant) finite dimensional operators [formula] and [formula], acting on the vector space [formula] introduced above, defined by

[formula]

and

[formula]

The superscripts "n" and "e" stand for "nucleus" and "electron", respectively, as a reminder that ([\ref=CjB]) is a vestige of the interaction between the j-th electron and the nucleus, while ([\ref=CjkB]) originates in the electron-electron interaction between electrons j and k. Finally, define an operator [formula] on [formula] (the 'C' standing for 'Coulomb') by

[formula]

As we will see in section 4, the right hand side of ([\ref=h0Bintro]) defines a self-adjoint operator [formula] on [formula], despite the distributional potentials. This will be a consequence of the Kato-Lax-Lions-Milgram-Nelson Theorem. The form domain of [formula] is simply the vector-valued first Sobolev space [formula], while its operator domain will be characterized in appendix A. As in ([\ref=GrandHeff]) we introduce

[formula]

Our second main theorem then is the following:

Let α  =  α(B) be as in Theorem [\ref=FMT], and put [formula] There exists positive constants BC, cC and CC which depend only on Z,N and [formula], such that for all B  ≥  BC and all real ξ satisfying

[formula]

we have that [formula], and

[formula]

A simpler effective Hamiltonian, our third and last one, and historically the first to be proposed (cf. [\cite=LSY], [\cite=BaSoY], [\cite=BD]), is roughly speaking obtained by only keeping the leading term in the potential of [formula]. More precisely, we put:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Looking back at ([\ref=qBintro]) it would seem natural to take as potential log Bvδ, but it turns out that 2α(B)vδ leads to smaller error estimates; notice that in view of ([\ref=AlphAsymptotics]), 2αvδ is also a O( log B) part of the potential in hBC. Furthermore, with this choice the coupling constant 2α(B) is positive for all B > 0 which is not the case for log B. Contrary to our previous two effective Hamiltonians, hBδ does not explicitly depend on [formula] anymore, but it will operate on an [formula] and B-dependent Hilbert space, namely [formula] (which in fact are canonically isomorphic for different B). Considering ([\ref=Hdelta1]) as acting on scalar [formula], we define the δ-model as being the operator

[formula]

We will often simply write hBδ, except when we want to stress the vector-valued nature of the L2-functions in the domain. Again as in ([\ref=GrandHeff]) we introduce

[formula]

Our third approximation theorem is:

Let α: = α(B) be as in Theorem [\ref=FMT], and put [formula]. There exist positive constants Bδ, cδ and Cδ, depending on N, Z and [formula], such that for all B  ≥  Bδ and real ξ satisfying

[formula]

we have that [formula], and

[formula]

See [\cite=BD] for weaker versions of this theorem. We also mention [\cite=BaSoY], which established the convergence of the ground state energy of fermionic HB (see below) to that of bosonic (scalar) hBδ on [formula], using variational arguments: these authors did not fix [formula], but they only proved convergence of the ground state energy, while we can conclude much more from the norm resolvent convergence to the effective hamiltonians; see for a list of applications of the results of the present paper. Earlier, [\cite=LSY] had shown that the ground state of the Hartree mean-field model associated to ([\ref=Hdelta1]) approximates the quantum mechanical ground state energy in the so-called hyper-strong limit Z,B / Z3  →    ∞  , assuming N / Z uniformly bounded. The idea that a model such as the δ-model could be relevant in the context of strong magnetic fields is not new in the physics literature, see e.g. [\cite=Spr].

We next turn to the effects of particle symmetry. Electrons in physical atoms are fermions, and we now consider the analogues of Theorems [\ref=FMT], [\ref=SMT] and [\ref=CorrSMT] for HB restricted to the fermionic subspace f  =  PAS(), where PAS is the orthogonal projection onto the subspace of anti-symmetric symmetric wave-functions defined by:

[formula]

with ( - 1)σ: = ( - 1)(σ). The projection PAS commutes with HB, [formula], [formula] and with the N-particle Landau Hamiltonian HB0 defined in ([\ref=LandauHam]) below, and therefore also with [formula] (see section 2). Recalling that we have fixed our spins to [formula], PAS for us will only act in the 'spatial' variables [formula]. Let [formula], the fermionic Pauli operator with z-angular momentum [formula]. Similarly, introduce 'fermionized' versions of the other operators: [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], hBδ,f: = PAShBδ, [formula] and finally [formula] A careful examination of the proofs of Theorems [\ref=FMT], [\ref=SMT] and [\ref=CorrSMT] will show:

Theorems [\ref=FMT], [\ref=SMT] and [\ref=CorrSMT] also hold true for the fermionized operators. For example, if ξ satisfies the conditions of theorem [\ref=FMT] with deff(ξ) replaced by [formula], then

[formula]

with the same constants as before. Similarly for [formula], [formula]

The operators [formula] and [formula] are easily described:

[formula]

where, using the notation of ([\ref=defVeffietjk]),

[formula]

and

[formula]

the average one-, respectively two-particle potentials. Similarly, [formula] equals

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

while [formula] is given by the same expression as hBδ, except of course that its domain changes.

To complete the picture, we finish with an explicit description of [formula], which is equal to [formula]. Fix [formula], and let

[formula]

the set of partitions of [formula], where, as usual, [formula] if [formula]. The vector space [formula] is spanned by the lowest Landau (generalized) eigenstates indexed by [formula], cf. section 2 below. The symmetric group SN acts on [formula] in the natural way, by permuting the indices of an element [formula] of [formula] Under this action, [formula] will decompose as a finite union of disjoint orbits:

[formula]

[formula] being a set of representatives of the orbits. If [formula] denotes the stabilizer of [formula], then we write [formula] as a disjoint union [formula], with 1 the subset of those [formula] such that [formula], and [formula], its complement. In other words, [formula] iff no two components of [formula] are the same, and [formula] iff at least two of its components are identical. Let [formula] be the space of anti-symmetrical wave functions in [formula]. We then will prove, in section 8, that:

There is a natural unitary isomorphism

[formula]

and

[formula]

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the precise definition of our effective projector [formula] In section 3 we establish, with the help of the Feschbach decomposition, a first approximation theorem, comparing [formula]'s resolvent at ξ with that of [formula], where the last term is an auxiliary 'potential' which itself depends on the spectral parameter ξ. Section 4 analyzes the large-B behavior of the potential of [formula], as well as that of [formula] Sections 5, 6 and 7 are devoted to the proofs of, respectively, theorems [\ref=FMT], [\ref=SMT] and [\ref=CorrSMT]. In section 8 we prove theorems [\ref=FermionizedMThms] and [\ref=ThMT]. Section 9, finally, concludes with some applications to the spectral theory of [formula], and some general observations.

Convention on constants. In the course of this work, we have had to introduce a large number of constants. To keep track of them, we will use the convention that whenever the subscript of a constant is a number, the number refers to the formula where the constant in question was first introduced. That is, C(x) := constant defined in formula (x).

Non-interacting electrons and the Lowest Landau Band

We begin by reviewing the spectral decomposition of

[formula]

the "free" Hamiltonian of N independent electrons interacting only with the field [formula]. Recall that we have fixed all electron spins in their szj =  - 1-state. The operator HB0 is just a direct sum of N one-particle operators [formula], whose spectral decomposition is explicitly known:

[formula]

Here, pz is the momentum in the field direction, and ΠBm,n is the projection, in the x,y-variables, onto the normalized eigenfunctions [formula] of the operator

[formula]

restricted to the m-eigenspace of Lz  =  xpy  -  ypx, the angular momentum in the field-direction. These eigenfunctions are explicitly known in terms of Laguerre functions, see e.g. [\cite=FW], but for our purposes we will only need those with n  =  0, m  ≥  0. These have a particularly simple expression: if (ρ,φ) are polar coordinates in the x,y-plane, then

[formula]

The spectral decomposition of HB0 is simply the sum of the one-particle decompositions, and the projections onto its eigenstates will be indexed by N-tuples [formula], [formula]. If we let

[formula]

then

[formula]

The Lowest Landau Band of HB0 is defined as

[formula]

where [formula], and if we put

[formula]

then 0 will be spanned by the tensor products [formula], with [formula] We will call the XBm the lowest Landau band states (these are not eigenvectors of HB0, but [formula] would be generalized eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0). The operator HB0 restricted to B0 simply is the free Laplacian in the field direction,

[formula]

where [formula].

We next reduce the Hamiltonians HB and HB0 to their angular momentum sectors with respect to the field direction. The total orbital angular momentum in the direction of [formula],

[formula]

commutes with HB and HB0, and is therefore a constant of motion for both Hamiltonians. If [formula] is the orthogonal projection onto the [formula]-th eigenspace of [formula], then we let

[formula]

acting on [formula]. Since we are primarily interested in the spectral behavior of HB near the bottom of its spectrum, we will restrict [formula] to [formula], for [formula] Indeed, notice that since [formula] is unitarily equivalent to [formula], one has [formula] as soon as B > 0.

We next let

[formula]

the set of partitions of [formula], and define the effective projection [formula] by

[formula]

This is simply the orthogonal projection onto [formula]. We also let [formula] be the orthogonal projection onto the orthogonal complement of [formula] in [formula]. Observe that

[formula]

If we let [formula] be the finite dimensional vector space spanned by the lowest Landau states with total angular momentum [formula],

[formula]

then we can identify the range of [formula] with the space [formula] of [formula]-valued L2-functions, as we will do without further comment.

To lighten the notations, we will often suppress one or both upper-indices B or [formula], unless where this would cause confusion. This will always be clearly indicated, usually at the beginning of a section.

Estimates for Feschbach decompositions

We fix a non-negative integer [formula]. In this section we will drop all upper-indices B, [formula], and simply write H for [formula], H0 for [formula] and Πeff respectively [formula] for [formula] and [formula]. We write our atomic Hamiltonian [formula] as

[formula]

where

[formula]

the electrostatic potential, and introduce the operators

[formula]

and its adjoint, [formula]. These are to be considered as operators on Πeff, [formula], and between these two Hilbert spaces, respectively. We furthermore put

[formula]

and for [formula] introduce the resolvents (wherever defined)

[formula]

where

[formula]

Strictly speaking [formula] is not a resolvent since the potential (ξ) depends on the spectral parameter ξ. The operators R and [formula] act on, respectively, the ranges of [formula] and of Πeff. Finally, let

[formula]

T commutes with Πeff and [formula], and [formula]. Note that

[formula]

on the range of [formula]

Using matrix notation associated to the decomposition [formula], we decompose H as

[formula]

By the classical Feschbach formula, we then have

[formula]

for those [formula] for which the right hand side makes sense. The following theorem is the main result of this section: recall that ρ(A) denotes the resolvent set of an operator A, and σ(A) its spectrum.

Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

If ξ  ≤  0 and if the field strength B  ≥  B(), then [formula]. If, moreover, ξ∉σ(Heff  +  ), then ξ∈ρ(H), and

[formula]

where [formula] is the distance of ξ to σ(heff  +  ).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=ME]. The proof consists of estimating the relevant matrix elements in the Feschbach formula. This will be done in several steps. Let

[formula]

the resolvent of [formula] on [formula]

Bound on R0. Since [formula] on [formula] and since ξ  ≤  0, it immediately follows that [formula] Write [formula] as

[formula]

the sum of electron-nucleus and the electron-electron interactions.

A remark on notation: we will often leave the projection [formula] understood when multiplying operators on the left and/or right by R0 or R, and for example simply write R1 / 20nR1 / 20 instead of the more explicit [formula]

Bound on R1 / 20nR1 / 20. First, since R0  ≤  B- 1 on the range of [formula],

[formula]

By Cauchy-Schwarz,

[formula]

Next, using Hardy's inequality on [formula]: |rj|- 2  ≤    -  4Δj, and the fact that

[formula]

we find that

[formula]

since ξ  ≤  0. It follows from these estimates that

[formula]

We note, as a consequence, that if [formula], then [formula] if B  >  b0. For later reference we also note the:

Bound on R1 / 202nR1 / 20: the estimates above immediately imply that this positive operator is bounded from above by [formula]

Existence of and bound on R. Since the electron-electron repulsion e  ≥  0, it follows that [formula], where [formula], the resolvent of an atom with non-interacting electrons. Using the symmetrized resolvent formula,

[formula]

we see that RNI exists and is positive if B  >  b0 and ξ  ≤  0. Hence [formula] and therefore also [formula] and R. Moreover, if [formula], then every ξ  ≤  0 belongs to [formula] and

[formula]

Bound on R1 / 202eR1 / 20: The following elementary operator inequality is very useful to estimate the electron-electron interactions.

[formula]

Proof. The unitary transformation induced by the following orthogonal transformation of [formula],

[formula]

commutes with the Laplacian, and transforms |rj  -  rk|- 2 into 2- 1|s|- 2. By Hardy's inequality,

[formula]

and transforming back to the (rj,rk)-coordinates yields ([\ref=Hardy']). QED

We can then estimate:

[formula]

and therefore, by similar arguments as before,

[formula]

on [formula]

Bound on R1 / 20: By the general identity [formula], we have:

[formula]

Bound on [formula]: (Remember that we have shown that R  ≥  0, so its square root is well-defined.) We first estimate [formula], as follows. Recalling the non-interacting resolvent [formula] introduced above, we have that:

[formula]

Hence its norm can be estimated by:

[formula]

from which we obtain an estimate for [formula] by taking square roots. Therefore, if B  ≥  B()  =  4b0 as above,

[formula]

We now come to the proof of ([\ref=MainEstimate]). By Feschbach's formula, we have

[formula]

where we have used the following elementary estimate for the norm of matrices of operators:

[formula]

Hence if B  >  B() and if [formula], we obtain

[formula]

with [formula] QED

( of the proof) Theorem [\ref=ME] also holds, if we replace H and heff  +   by their fermionized versions Hf, heff,f  +  f, and [formula] by the distance of ξ to the spectrum of heff,f  +  f.

Proof. Simply write down the Feschbach's formula ([\ref=Feschbach]) for Hf with respect to the decomposition [formula] of f, and estimate as in ([\ref=block-matrix-norm]), where all operators will now have a sub-index 'f'. Next use that PAS commutes with everything, and trivially estimate [formula], for A  =  R,R1 / 2 and [formula], except for [formula], which will be estimated by 1 over the distance of ξ to the spectrum of Heff,f  +  f. QED

The proof shows that in the fermionic case, Theorem [\ref=ME] will at least be true with the same constants as for the boltzonic case. The optimal constants for fermions might be smaller, though.

Effective potentials for large fields

The operator [formula] of Theorem [\ref=ME] acts on [formula], a Hilbert space which depends on both B and [formula], and which is canonically isomorphic to the space of [formula]-valued L2-functions on [formula],

[formula]

(Recall that [formula].) We will mostly suppress the [formula]-dependence from our notations, [formula] being fixed in our analysis. The potential term of hBeff,

[formula]

can be interpreted as an operator valued function of [formula], with values in the space of linear operators on [formula] and acting in the natural way on [formula] To get rid of the B-dependence of our Hilbert spaces we do a unitary re-scaling. Let us pose [formula] and similarly for y and z. Define a unitary operator UBxy on [formula] by:

[formula]

Since [formula], it follows that

[formula]

Let us write Beff in multi-particle form:

[formula]

with VBj and VBjk defined by ([\ref=defVeffietjk]). Then [formula], with

[formula]

and likewise for VBjk: [formula], with

[formula]

The operator

[formula]

will now act on the fixed, B-independent, Hilbert space, [formula], and

[formula]

The next step will be to examine the asymptotic behavior of [formula] as B  →    ∞  . The main idea is contained in lemma [\ref=Asymp-Lemma] below. We introduce the free Laplacian on [formula],

[formula]

and its resolvent:

[formula]

We will need this resolvent both in dimension N and dimension 1. To distinguish between these two cases we will, in the 1-dimensional case, systematically use β2 as spectral parameter instead of α2, reserving the latter for the multidimensional case.

If u is a function or tempered distribution on [formula], with values in some auxiliary Hilbert space F, then [formula] is a norm on the s-th Sobolev space [formula]. A linear operator A sends [formula] continuously into [formula] iff the L2-operator norm [formula] is finite. The case of interest for us will be s  =  1. We will also need the Fourier transform [formula], but only in dimension 1, for which we normalize as follows:

[formula]

There will consequently be a factor of (2π)- 1 in the inversion formula.

Recall that

[formula]

with the derivative in distribution sense. Let F be a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space, and L(F) the space of linear operators on F.

Let [formula] be an L(F)-valued tempered distribution on [formula], such that its Fourier transform can be identified with a locally integrable function [formula]. Assume also:

(i) There exist C0,C1∈L(F) and a  >  1 / 2, such that:

[formula]

(ii) If

[formula]

denotes the error in the approximation ([\ref=AsympF-Hat]), then

[formula]

For each λ > 0 let

[formula]

where δ is Dirac's delta-distribution in 0, and γ  =  Γ'(1) is the Euler constant. If R00( - β2) denotes the free resolvent in dimension 1 and β  >  0, then

[formula]

Remark. Observe that the integral ([\ref=ErrorAsymp]) converges in 0, since we assumed that a  >  1  /  2 in ([\ref=AsympF-Hat]).

Proof. It is known that

[formula]

where γ is Euler's constant: cf. e.g. [\cite=Schw]. Therefore

[formula]

and

[formula]

is an integral operator with kernel:

[formula]

since multiplication by a distribution a(x) becomes an integral operator with kernel (2π)- 1Fa(ζ  -  ζ') after conjugation by [formula]. Since conjugation by the Fourier transform does not change the operator norm, it follows that the norm in ([\ref=Asymp-Est]) can be bounded by the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of ([\ref=AL1]), whose square equals:

[formula]

Here we have used the elementary integral identity:

[formula]

where a,b  >  0. This finishes the proof of lemma [\ref=Asymp-Lemma]. QED.

We will apply the previous lemma to our potentials ([\ref=defVeffietjk]), but before doing so we first state and prove a weaker variant, which will be used to prove Theorem [\ref=FMT]. Let us introduce the (numerical) constant:

[formula]

Numerical evaluation of the integral (using either Mathematica or Maple 8) gives C2()≃1.53.

Let [formula] be an L(F)-valued tempered distribution on [formula] such that

[formula]

Then for all λ  ≥  e and all ε  >  0,

[formula]

Proof. Conjugating as before by the Fourier transform, and estimating the operator norm by the Hilbert-Schmidt one, we find that the left hand side of ([\ref=Asymp1a-Est]) is bounded, by the square root of

[formula]

By ([\ref=HypAsympPot1a]) we can bound

[formula]

since we suppose that λ  ≥  e. Hence, using ([\ref=AL2]) again, we find that our norm is bounded by the square root of

[formula]

by ([\ref=AsympPot1a:c]). Since C2()  ≥  1 / 2, we see that ([\ref=Asymp1a-Est]) will be bounded by [formula], as claimed. QED

The next step will be to apply lemma [\ref=Asymp-Lemma] to the potentials V1j and V1jk, with [formula]. We introduce the B-dependent tempered distribution q  =  qB, and linear operators [formula] by:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Observe that ([\ref=Cn]) and ([\ref=Ce]) are related to ([\ref=CjB]) and ([\ref=CjkB]) by conjugation by UBxy. See also remark [\ref=interpr:v_C] for a physical interpretation of these three terms.

Let [formula], β  >  0 be the free resolvent in dimension 1. There exists a positive constant [formula] only depending on [formula], such that for all B,β  >  0,

[formula]

and

[formula]

the norm being the operator norm on [formula].

To simplify future estimates, we have taken the same constant in both inequalities.

Proof. Recall the formulas ([\ref=def:V1j]) and ([\ref=def:V1jk]) for V1j(z) and V1jk(z). We need the asymptotics of their Fourier-transforms at 0. By [\cite=AS], the Fourier transform of (1  +  z2)- 1 / 2 equals

[formula]

where K0 is the Macdonald function. Since the projector Π1eff effectively only acts in the x and y-variables, it follows that

[formula]

with a similar formula for FV1jk.

Now it is known that

[formula]

and that K0(|ζ|) is bounded on |ζ|  ≥  1 (even exponentially decreasing there): see e.g. [\cite=AS]. It then easily follows that, as ζ  →  0 and as operators on Π1eff,

[formula]

with an error of O(|ζ2 log |ζ| |). An appeal to lemma [\ref=Asymp-Lemma], with [formula] and with C0  =  2 and C1  =    -  2γ  +  Cnj respectively C1  =   - 2γ  +  Cejk, then finishes the proof. QED

We will likewise need lemma [\ref=AsympPot1a] for [formula]. We can without loss of generality assume that j  =  1, by permutational symmetry of [formula]. As we have seen above, [formula]. It can easily be verified that [formula], so that, for example,

[formula]

The operator norm on the right and side can be evaluated explicitly, and behaves asymptotically for large positive [formula] as [formula]

We next extend lemma [\ref=AsympPot1] to multi-particle potentials. Let us define the multi-particle potential vC by

[formula]

Let [formula], α  >  0, be the resolvent of the free Hamiltonian in [formula]. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

Proof. We split both potentials into their 'electron-nucleus' and 'electron-electron' parts:

[formula]

and similarly for vC: vC  =  vC,n  +  vC,e  =  vBC,n  +  vBC,e. Writing Bs,ν(z) for [formula] (with a mild abuse of notation), where ν  =  n or e, we bound the left hand side of ([\ref=V-eff1]) by

[formula]

and estimate the two terms separately. Let R00,j( - β2) be the 1-dimensional resolvent in the variable zj, with a β which will be picked below. We will simply write R00 for R00(  -  α2) and R00,j for R00,j(  -  β2). If we put

[formula]

and

[formula]

then, by ([\ref=asympVj]),

[formula]

if we pick [formula]; this choice actually minimizes β- 1 / 2 max (1,Nβ2  /  α2) as a function of β  ≥  0, as is easily checked. Similar estimates show that -  R1 / 200ΔnR1 / 200 is bounded from above, in operator sense, by the same number, and we therefore conclude that the first norm in ([\ref=V-eff2]) is bounded by [formula]

To estimate the second term of ([\ref=V-eff2]), we will use the following lemma, which is analogous to lemma [\ref=FE-special] from section 2. Let Δj  =    -  d2  /  dz2j, Δk  =    -  d2 / dz2k.

Let [formula] be an L(F)-valued distribution on [formula] (F a finite-dimensional Hilbert space), such that [formula] is self-adjoint, for β  >  0. Then for all μ  >  0,

[formula]

where the norm on the left hand side is of course taken in [formula]

Proof. We use a similar change of variables as in the proof of lemma [\ref=FE-special]: [formula], [formula]. Then, with ≃ denoting unitary equivalence,

[formula]

Observing that

[formula]

on [formula], the lemma follows. QED

Let us write

[formula]

the 2-dimensional free resolvent, where μ will be optimized at the end of the proof. Recall that R00  =  R00( - α2), and put

[formula]

Then, using lemmas [\ref=FE-special'] and [\ref=AsympPot1], R1 / 2(Beff,e  -  vBC,e)R1 / 200 can be estimated from above as follows:

[formula]

where we minimized the right hand side over μ by choosing [formula]. The similar upper bound for  -  R1 / 2(e  -  vBC,e)R1 / 200 gives the desired estimate for the second norm in ([\ref=V-eff2]), and combining the two estimates, we have proved lemma [\ref=AsympPot2]. QED

We now derive a similar estimate for B as B  →    ∞  .

Let R00(  -  α2) be the free resolvent in dimension N, and let U  =  UBxy be the unitary transformation defined by ([\ref=def-U]). Then, if ξ  ≤  0,

[formula]

with

[formula]

Proof. Recall that [formula], where [formula] on [formula]. Hence

[formula]

where [formula], and similarly for [formula]. Since for ξ  ≤  0, 0  ≤  R  ≤  2 / B (see section 3), we have that, letting (  ·  ,z) be the function (x,y)  →  (x,y,z),

[formula]

As in the previous lemma, we treat the two terms separately. By Cauchy-Schwarz,

[formula]

where ρ2j  =  x2j  +  y2j. As before, let R00,j(  -  β2) be the resolvent of h00,j  =   - (1 / 2)d2  /  dz2j on [formula]. We first estimate the L2-norm of each

[formula]

by conjugating with the Fourier transform [formula]. Since [formula], ([\ref=est-W1]) then becomes an integral operator with kernel

[formula]

The norm of ([\ref=est-W2]) can be estimated by its Hilbert-Schmidt norm, whose square can be bounded by:

[formula]

where we have put

[formula]

Note that C() is independent of j, because of the permutational symmetry of [formula]. It follows that:

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

if we choose [formula] The same inequality then holds for the norm, since the operator we estimate is positive.

We next treat the interaction term [formula] in a similar way as in the proof of lemma [\ref=AsympPot2]. First, by Cauchy-Schwarz again,

[formula]

where we have put ρ2jk  =  (xj  -  xk)2  +  (yj  -  yk)2. Since the rotation (rj,rk)  →   [formula] commutes with Π1eff (since it commutes with H10 and with [formula]), we find, after a unitary transformation, that

[formula]

compare the proof of lemma [\ref=FE-special']. Hence, using similar arguments as before,

[formula]

if we choose [formula]. Adding this estimate to the one for 2n, and remembering the factor 4 from ([\ref=est-W0.5]), we have proved ([\ref=est-W] ) with the constant [formula]. A priori, C() might still depend on [formula], but it in fact does not, as we will finally show. We compute C() in the Landau basis ([\ref=LLBF]) of [formula], with respect to which Π1eff  ρ- 11  Π1eff diagonalizes:

[formula]

It is known that

[formula]

cf. e.g. [\cite=AS], formula (6.1.12), page 255. Using this, one easily finds that

[formula]

which completes the proof of the lemma. QED

To prove Theorem [\ref=CorrSMT] we will need to control the Sobolev norm of VB1  -  vBδ. This is done in the following lemma, which we formulate in slightly greater generality than needed, with an eye to future applications.

Let [formula] be defined as in ([\ref=defVeffietjk]), c  >  0 and let αc  =  αc(B) be the unique positive solution of

[formula]

Then the constant

[formula]

is finite and depends only on [formula]. Moreover for all c  >  0 and all B > 0

[formula]

Observe that if c  =  2, then αc(B) is the α(B) from Theorem [\ref=FMT]: cf. ([\ref=FMT:alpha]). Also note that the constant C() is independent of c  >  0.

Proof. The first statement follows at once using the explicit knowledge of FV11 obtained in the proof of lemma [\ref=AsympPot1]. To prove the estimate ([\ref=VeffMoinsDelta]) we introduce the auxiliary function X by

[formula]

where in the first line we used equation ([\ref=alpha-c]). The Fourier transform of VB1 - cαc(B)δ acts as convolution by a function, and we estimate the norm of [formula] by its Hilbert-Schmidt norm, as in the proofs of lemmas [\ref=Asymp-Lemma], [\ref=AsympPot1a]. It follows that

[formula]

First,

[formula]

We next look at the contribution of X, which we split in two parts:

[formula]

since

[formula]

and

[formula]

The rest is now elementary. Notice in particular that [formula].

The limit potential ([\ref=V-eff]) suggests defining an effective Hamiltonian hC  =  hBC by:

[formula]

As it stands, this is just a formal expression, and our first task is to give a meaning to hC as a self-adjoint operator on [formula]. We do this by showing that vC is form-bounded with respect h00, with zero relative form-bound. Let 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 denote the duality between distributions and test functions.

The quadratic forms u  →  〈δ,|u|2〉  =  |u(0)|2 and u  →  〈(1  /  |z|),|u|2〉 are well-defined on [formula], and form-bounded with respect to h00, with relative bound zero. More precisely, we have for all ε  >  0 that

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

Proof. This is well-known for δ. For (|z|- 1) we first note that, since (|z|- 1)  =   - 2- 1( log |ζ|)  -  2γδ0, it suffices to prove the form-boundedness of - 1( log |ζ|). The latter will follow from:

[formula]

for all ε  >  0. To prove ([\ref=relFlog]), observe that after conjugation by the Fourier transform [formula], and estimating the operator norm by the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, the square of ([\ref=relFlog]) can be bounded by:

[formula]

Changing variables and using ([\ref=AL2]), we find that ([\ref=HS]) can be bounded by

[formula]

Hence, using ([\ref=rel-delta]),

[formula]

which implies ([\ref=relPf]) since [formula]

Because of the terms Cnjδ(zj) and Cejkδ(zj  -  zk) we have to extend the first part of lemma [\ref=relformbound] to the vector-valued case, but this is immediate: we just note that if C a linear operator on [formula] (or any finite-dimensional vector space, for that matter), then the right interpretation of Cδ as quadratic form on [formula] is given by [formula], where (  ·  ,  ·  ) is the inner product on [formula].

Finally, we lift lemma [\ref=relformbound] to [formula]. Recall that if [formula] is a linear map, then the pull-back L*Λ of a distribution Λ on [formula] is well-defined, and can be computed by going to linear coordinates z' with respect to which L(z')  =  z'1. It then immediately follows from lemma [\ref=relformbound] that L*δ and L*qB will be form-bounded with respect to h00 on [formula], with relative bound 0. Taking L(z)  =  Lj(z)  =  zj and L(z)  =  Ljk(z)  =  zj  -  zk, we see that the sesqui-linear form tBC(u) given by

[formula]

is well-defined on [formula], and bounded from below by - C||u||2, for some constant C, depending on B,Z,N and [formula]. By the Kato-Lax-Lions-Milgram-Nelson Theorem (cf. e.g. [\cite=RS2]), tBC defines a unique self-adjoint operator, which we will call [formula], and informally write as ([\ref=EffHam1]). In Appendix A we will give a characterization of the operator domain of hBC. Similar arguments will define hBδ as a self-adjoint operator, cf. [\cite=BD].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=FMT]

We will first compare the resolvents of [formula] and of heff  +  , where [formula] was defined at the beginning of section 3. Put

[formula]

and let

[formula]

where α  =  α(B) is the function defined by ([\ref=FMT:alpha]) , and

[formula]

with [formula] the unique positive solution of

[formula]

where CV11 is defined by ([\ref=HypAsympPot1a]) with [formula] (see ([\ref=C_V1:1]) for an upper bound). Note that both constants only depend on N, Z and [formula], and this in a controlled way.

We then have:

If B  ≥  B(), ξ  ≤  0 and

[formula]

with α  =  α(B) is as in Theorem [\ref=FMT], then ξ∈ρ(heff  +  ), and [formula]. Furthermore,

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=FMT']. It clearly suffices to establish Theorem [\ref=FMT'] after conjugation by UBxy, defined by ([\ref=def-U]). To simplify notations, we will simply denote the conjugated operators by the same letters as the original ones. Using the symmetrized resolvent formula we estimate

[formula]

where

[formula]

with the convention that A1 / 2: = (A)|A|1 / 2, if A is a self-adjoint operator. Now let μ  <   inf (σ(heff), to be specified later. The following elementary lemma will allow us to replace ξ by μ in ([\ref=FMT':3]).

If μ  <   inf σ(heff), then for all real ξ in the resolvent set ρ(heff),

[formula]

Proof. We distinguish two cases: inf σ(heff)  <  ξ  <  0 and ξ  <   inf σ(heff). (Observe that inf σ(heff)  <  0, by the HVZ Theorem, since this is already the case for N  =  1). In the first case, let (ξ-,ξ+) be the largest open interval in ρ(heff) which contains ξ. Since

[formula]

A characterization of the operator domain of hC

In this appendix we will characterize the operator domain of hC  =  hBC. It will in fact be convenient to consider a slightly more general situation. Let   =  {Lν,1  ≤  ν  ≤  K}, be a finite collection of hyperplanes in [formula] (we might more generally consider non-singular C1-hypersurfaces). Let F be a finite dimensional complex vector space, with Hermitian inner product (  ·  ,  ·  ) and let Aν,Bν be Hermitian operators on F. Let [formula] be the k-th Sobolev space on [formula], with values in F. Then the following sesquilinear form is well-defined on [formula] and bounded from below:

[formula]

〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 denoting the duality between distributions and test functions. We let

[formula]

be the associated self-adjoint operator, whose existence is guaranteed by the [formula]-Theorem. Let [formula] be the set of connected components of [formula], so that [formula] and [formula], if R,R'∈,R  ≠  R'. Note that, on any of these components R, L*j(1  /  |  ·  |) simply equals the function 1  /  |Lj(z)|. We will identify Lj with an element of [formula], using the Euclidean inner product on [formula]; the latter will be denoted by a dot: z  ·  w, to distinguish it from the Hermitian inner product (v,w) on F. If we let H2(R,F) be the F-valued Sobolev space of order 2 on the open subset [formula], then the domain of [formula] can be characterized as follows:

Let [formula]. Then [formula] iff the following three conditions hold:

(i) [formula]

(ii) For each R∈,

[formula]

(iii) For each j and for each [formula]:

[formula]

as ε  →  0.

Proof. We will use the following characterization ( see [\cite=K]) of [formula]:

[formula]

the norm on the right being the L2-norm. Here we may, and will, suppose without loss of generality that [formula], the space of compactly supported F-valued C1-functions.

To analyze ([\ref=Kato]), we will first establish a convenient integral expression for the pull-backs of δ and of (1 / |  ·  |) under a linear map [formula]. Using the Euclidean inner product, we can identify L with an element of [formula], which we also denote by L. Using the definition of pull-back (cf. Hörmander [\cite=H], chapter 6), one easily shows that if dσL denotes the Euclidean surface measure on (L), and [formula] is the Euclidean norm of L, then

[formula]

and

[formula]

In fact, since taking pull-backs is coordinate invariant, it suffices to verify these formulas in a orthogonal coordinate system in which [formula].

We next observe that, for each R∈, there exists a (unique) function [formula], such that

[formula]

and if ε  >  0, we define Rε by:

[formula]

Observe that the boundary of Rε, as well as that of R, are polyhedrae, each of whose faces are contained in one the hypersurfaces {( - 1)sR(j)Lj  =  ε} and {Lj  =  0}, respectively. On such a face, the outward-pointing normal nR,ε can be identified with the vector [formula] (translated to the relevant base point on the face, to be precise). Note, that nR,ε is only defined a.e. on the boundary (with respect to the surface measure). This will not cause difficulties, though.

Suppose now that [formula] and in particular satisfies the conditions ([\ref=Kato]). We then have, for any [formula],

[formula]

We want to apply Gauss' divergence Theorem to each of the integrals over Rε: this is allowed since if [formula] satisfies ([\ref=Kato]), then by choosing v compactly supported in R, we see that

[formula]

which obviously implies that Δu∈L2loc(R,F) (since we are staying away from the singularities on the hyperplanes), and hence u∈H2loc(R,F). Now

[formula]

dσR,ε being the euclidean surface measure on the boundary. Furthermore,

[formula]

Using this, the second term in ([\ref=tL2]) can, after re-arranging, be written as:

[formula]

the surface integrals being with respect to the natural surface measures. Since v is compactly supported, the third sum will vanish, in the limit of ε  →  0. This follows from the local integrability of u  ·   log |Lj| on {Lk  =  0} (if j  ≠  k), which can be seen as follows. Since u∈H1, its restriction u|{Lk  =  0} is in (vector-valued) L2. On the other hand, log |Lj|, restricted to {Lk  =  0} is in [formula], and therefore u log |Lj|, restricted to {Lk  =  0} is locally integrable. Rearranging also the sum over [formula] of the boundary terms in ([\ref=tL3]) as a sum of integrals over the various hypersurfaces {Lj  =    ±  ε}, we conclude that for [formula],

[formula]

Since u∈H1 implies that [formula], and since (u,v)∈L1({Lj  =  0}), we can replace the next to last term by

[formula]

We can, for the same reason, replace v in the second integral by its restriction to {Lj  =  0}. Letting ε  →  0, it follows that if u satisfies ([\ref=Kato]), then it satisfies (i), (ii) and (iii).

Conversely, suppose that u satisfies conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of the theorem. Then running the argument backwards shows that [formula], first for all compactly supported v and thence for all [formula]. Hence [formula], by ([\ref=Kato]). QED
