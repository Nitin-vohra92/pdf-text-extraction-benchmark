Definition

A refined counter-example to the support conjecture for abelian varieties

Let A be an abelian variety over a number field K and let P and Q be K-rational points of A. By inverting a suitable element in the ring of integers of K, one can always find a Dedekind domain O with fraction field K such that A extends to an abelian scheme A over O and P and Q extend to O-points of A. Therefore, one can speak of reducing P and Q (mod [formula]) for almost all (i.e., all but finitely many) primes [formula]. In [\cite=C-RS], C. Corrales-Rodrigáñez and R. Schoof proved that when dim A  =  1, the condition

[formula]

for all integers n and almost all prime ideals [formula] implies

[formula]

In [\cite=Larsen], M. Larsen proved that ([\ref=e:implication]) does not imply ([\ref=e:strong]) for general abelian varieties but that it does imply

[formula]

and some positive integer k. The counter-example presented to ([\ref=e:strong]) actually satisfies something stronger than ([\ref=e:weak]), namely

[formula]

and some torsion point T∈A(K).

An early draft of [\cite=arxiv] (version 2) claimed that ([\ref=e:implication]) in fact implies ([\ref=e:medium]). The proof given was incorrect, and the statement was removed from subsequent versions. (Version 3 is essentially the same as the published version [\cite=Larsen], while version 4 corrects a series of misprints, in which P was written for Q and vice versa throughout several paragraphs of the proof of the main theorem.)

In this note we present an example to show that ([\ref=e:implication]) does not imply ([\ref=e:medium]).

There exists an abelian variety A over a number field K and points P and Q which satisfy ([\ref=e:implication]) but not ([\ref=e:medium]).

Let p be a prime. Let K be a number field and let E be an elliptic curve over K without complex multiplication that possesses a point R∈E(K) of infinite order. Suppose in addition that the p-torsion points of E are rational over K and let R1,R2∈E(K) be two independent points of order p. Consider the abelian surface A obtained by dividing E  ×  E by the subgroup generated by the point (R1,R2). Then A is defined over K.

We describe the ring of K-endomorphisms of A. Let [formula], and let λ1,λ2∈p- 1Λ map to R1 and R2 respectively. Thus, if for certain integers a and b we have aλ1 + bλ2∈Λ, then necessarily [formula]. Let

[formula]

The complex torus [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], and any endomorphism of [formula] is given by a complex 2  ×  2 matrix

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some [formula]. As E does not have complex multiplication, ([\ref=e:lambda-squared]) implies [formula]. Multiplying ([\ref=e:torsion-image]) by p, we deduce that [formula], and then ([\ref=e:torsion-image]) implies [formula]. Conversely, any matrix ([\ref=e:matrix]) whose entries satisfy [formula] for some [formula], lies in [formula] and therefore in [formula]. Since the curve E and the points R1, R2 are defined over K, it lies therefore in [formula].

Let P and Q denote the images of the points (R,0) and (R,R) in A(K) respectively. Suppose that [formula] for some prime [formula] of good reduction and characteristic different from p. This means that (nR,nR) is contained in the subgroup generated by (R1,R2) in the group of points on E  ×  E modulo [formula]. Since the characteristic of [formula] is not p, the torsion points R1 and R2 are distinct modulo [formula]. This implies that [formula]. It follows that [formula]. Therefore condition ([\ref=e:implication]) is satisfied. And of course, so is the conclusion ([\ref=e:weak]) of Larsen's Theorem with k = p and [formula] the endomorphism with matrix [formula].

However, ([\ref=e:medium]) does not hold because there is no endomorphism [formula] for which P = gQ plus a torsion point. Indeed, this would imply

[formula]

for some [formula] and some torsion points T1,T2∈E(K). Since R has infinite order, inspection of the second coordinate shows that k + pc + pd = 0 so that [formula]. On the other hand, looking at the first coordinate we see that 1 = pa + pb + k, a contradiction.
