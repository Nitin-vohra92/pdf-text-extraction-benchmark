On integration of the closed KdV dressing chain

Introduction

This introduction is a citation from the paper [\cite=VSha]. The Darboux transformation scheme of dressing you can found at [\cite=L] [\cite=Mat] [\cite=LeZa], the chains were introduced at [\cite=We], studied at [\cite=Sha] [\cite={Novik}]. Consider a dressing chain for a Sturm-Liouville differential operator

[formula]

It is connected to the the linear Schrödinger equation

[formula]

by qn  =  σnx  +  σ2n  +  μn,      αn  =  μn  -  μn + 1. Let us close the chain ([\ref=1]) by the condition

[formula]

and assume that [formula] then we have finite dimensional dynamical system

[formula]

As was shown by Veselov and Shabat [\cite=VSha], for N = 2n + 1, it is bi-Hamiltonian system of the following form in gi = fi + fi + 1 coordinates:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and the generating function for hi is

[formula]

This is the end of the citation with the only comment that the generating function could be obtained as irreducible representation of the symmetry group of the dressing chain equations ([\ref=1]) [\cite=Lt]. More general symmetry is studied in [\cite=FSV].

Explicit formulas for the solutions of the the chain equations (N = 3)

If the system ([\ref=1]) is interpreted as a result of factorization of the operator SL of the equation ([\ref=2]) and the relation ([\ref=3]) supplies the necessary condition for this. If, further the factorization is linked to the DT, then μ is the spectral parameter corresponding to the auxiliary spectral function that parameterized the transformation. The parameter α is zero in this case.

Let us consider equations

[formula]

that is equivalent to the system ([\ref=4]) under the condition ([\ref=3]) with N=3. We use two integrals

[formula]

From (1) one obtains

[formula]

Using the first equation (2) σ3 = C - σ1  -  σ2 we will obtain the equation containing [formula]. As the next step we eliminate the remaining variable σ2 with the help the second integral in (2) and the first also. Thus, we get the equation

[formula]

The last equation has the form

[formula]

where a,b,d are constants defined by the previous expression (3). The extra multipliers 6,4 have been included for a convenience. The relation ([\ref=w]) is an elliptic curve in variables [formula] and therefore it is uniformised by elliptic functions. Let us built the invariants (capital letters are chosen that to distinguish them from variables gj of the chain)

[formula]

So, the pair (b,a) is a point on a curve

[formula]

Therefore, there exists a parameter ν such that the following equations will be hold:

[formula]

This means that we take three new parameters G2,G3,ν instead of old ones a,b,d depended on five parameters of the chain: (μ1,μ2,μ3,A,C). Now we may write

[formula]

that yields

[formula]

Note, the σ1 is not Weierstrass's σ-function in the theory of elliptic functions, but ζ is standard Weierstrass ζ-function. The solution σ1(x) contains three arbitrary constants (according to the third order of equations (1)) G2,G3,x0 which are, in its turn, defined by five ones μj,A,C in explicit but transcendental way. Parameter ν is not exceptional

[formula]

where [formula] denotes an elliptic integral of the first kind (inversion of elliptic function [formula]).

Remark 1: Just obtained solution solution is exactly logarithmic derivative of the Ψ-function for the 1-gap Lame potential

[formula]

and distinguished from the solution

[formula]

by the shift of the spectral parameter α.

Remark 2: If one interests in σi ([\ref=w]) in a connection with KdV equation theory, the dependence on time could be obtained using the t-chains [\cite=Lt], obtained by means of MKdV equation for σ and conservation laws [\cite=Wad].
