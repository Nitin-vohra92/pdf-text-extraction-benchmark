A very short proof of Cauchy's interlace theorem for eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices

We use an overlooked characterization of interlacing to give a two sentence proof of Cauchy's interlace theorem[\cite=hwang]. Recall that if polynomials f(x) and g(x) have all real roots [formula] and [formula] then we say that f and g interlace if and only if

[formula]

The following can be found in [\cite=rahman], along with a discussion of its history back to Hermite.

The roots of polynomials f,g interlace if and only if the linear combinations f + αg have all real roots for all [formula].

If A is a Hermitian matrix, and B is a principle submatrix of A, then the eigenvalues of B interlace the eigenvalues of A.

Choose [formula], partition [formula] and consider the following equation that follows from linearity of the determinant:

[formula]

Since the matrix on the left hand side is the characteristic polynomial of a Hermitian matrix, |A - xI|  +  α|B - xI| has all real roots for any α, and hence the eigenvalues interlace.
