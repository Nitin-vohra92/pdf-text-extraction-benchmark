On the survival and disruption of Earth mass CDM micro-haloes

Discussion

The rate of energy transfer by tidal heating by a class of objects depends on several factors including their mean density n *  and mean mass m * . Zhao et al. assumed n*m* = 0.1 for the Galactic disk and n*m* = 0.001 for halo stars. Observations suggest that more appropriate numbers would be 0.05 and < 0.0001 for disk and halo stars respectively, [\citep=MB1981] [\citep=Flynn1996] [\citep=Gould1998] [\citep=Ivezic2000] [\citep=Spagna2004]. Here the halo density is inferred from star counts, proper motion surveys, deep HST images and Sloan RR Lyrae counts. In their revised comment (version #4) Zhao et al. replaced the "halo" contribution with a "bulge" component. However this does not change the observational evidence that the stellar density high above the local Galactic disk is very low. Furthermore extrapolating the Galactic bulge to the solar radius is premature since recent observations suggest that the bulge is really part of the Galactic bar [\citep=Fr1998] [\citep=Pi2004], truncated at 4 kpc that is possibly undergoing a complex buckling instability. In which case it is unlikely that the bulge contributes to the halo density at the solar radius. These estimates of the halo density are all at least an order of magnitude lower than assumed by Zhao et al., which reduces the heating rate by non-disk stars to a minor level.

For Earth mass micro-halos with a half mass radius r1 / 2 = 0.005 pc and [formula] we find a critical impact parameter with a star, such that its internal energy changes by of order itself, to be bmin = 0.012 pc. The disk surface density is observed to be [formula] [\citep=K1989], therefore the probability of a disruptive collision per disk crossing is less than 0.02. This neglects the clustering of stars in the disk and is a crude estimate of survival probability but demonstrates that most of the haloes are not in the single encounter disruption regime. In Diemand et al. (2005) we estimated the disruption timescale by integrating the impulsive heating [formula] over all encounters and comparing to the binding energy of CDM haloes [formula] i.e. Binney & Tremaine (1989). With appropriate factors for the internal structure of these haloes we found a disruption timescale of tdis  â‰ˆ  30 Gyrs, assuming that the micro-haloes spend one percent of their time in the disk.

As mentioned in Diemand et al. (2005) we expect encounters with stars and molecular clouds to lead to some disruption and mass loss but that most such structures will stay intact. The impulse approximation is an approximation, as are semi-analytic models for such mass loss - tidal heating rarely leads to complete disruption and the high density central cores of orbiting systems can easily remain intact. Numerical simulations are vital to understand these complex dynamical processes. A more detailed study supported by numerical simulations in the spirit of Moore (1993) by the authors is in preparation. The most important factor in the survival statistics of micro-haloes is how many survive similar mass mergers as a Galactic mass halo is built up. However, even if just a few percent survive the hierarchical growth, many micro-haloes will lie within one parsec from the sun. Their dense cuspy cores will be sources of gamma-ray emission which could be uniquely distinguished by their high proper motions of order minutes of arc per year.
