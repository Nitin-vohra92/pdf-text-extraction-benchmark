Two multicolor Ramsey numbers

Two new bounds for multicolor Ramsey numbers are proved: R(K3,K3,C4,C4)  ≥  27 and R4(C4)  ≤  19.

Introduction

We prove two new bounds for multicolor Ramsey numbers, a lower bound for R(K3,K3,C4,C4) by coloring K26, and an upper bound for R4(C4) by a density argument.

The Ramsey number R(K3,K3,C4,C4)

From the survey of Ramsey numbers by Radziszowski [\cite=r] we know that R(K3,K3,C4,C4)  ≥  26. We use C5-decompositions to construct a four-coloring of the edges of K26, which show that R(K3,K3,C4,C4)  ≥  27. The technique used in this section was invented by Exoo and Reynolds [\cite=er].

R(K3,K3,C4,C4)  ≥  27.

Proof: Let X,Y,I,, and [formula] be defined by

The critical coloring which shows that R(K3,K3) > 5 and R(C4,C4) > 5 have the adjacency matrices X and Y. Observe that X + Y + I is the all-ones 5  ×  5 matrix.

We now construct four 26  ×  26 adjacency matrices Mi, so that M1 and M2 contain no K3, and M3 and M4 contain no C4.

Given a triangle-free graph on n vertices, we can construct a triangle-free graph on nm vertices by replacing each vertex with m vertices and each edge with Km,m. We construct the two first graphs, which are isomorphic, by beginning with C5, replacing the edges with K5,5 - e, and then adding a vertex with five edges.

[formula]

We denote the vertices from the top of the matrices as [formula]. The graphs are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:noK3]. Vertices 1 - 25 are the triangle-free constructions from C5 and K5,5 - e. Vertex 26 is in no triangle, since its neighbors have no edges between them. Hence, the graphs are triangle-free.

The remaining edges are distributed as described by the adjacency matrices M3 and M4.

[formula]

It is not hard to see that M1 + M2 + M3 + M4 is the adjacency matrix of K26. It is clear from Figure [\ref=fig:noC4] that there are no quadrilaterals. [formula]

The Ramsey number R4(C4)

From the Ramsey number survey [\cite=r] we also know that 18  ≤  R4(C4)  ≤  21. It was shown by Clapham, Flockhart and Sheehan [\cite=frs] that a C4-free graph with 19 vertices has at most 42 edges. Since 4  ·  42 = 168 and there are 171 edges in K19, it is not possible to four-color the edges of K19 without a monochromatic quadrilateral.

R4(C4)  ≤  19.
