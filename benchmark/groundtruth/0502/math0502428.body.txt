The colored Jones polynomials and the Alexander polynomial of the figure-eight knot

Introduction

Let K be a knot and JN(K;t) its colored Jones polynomial corresponding to the N-dimensional irreducible representation of [formula] normalized so that JN(U;t) = 1 for the unknot U. The volume conjecture [\cite=Murakami/Murakami:ACTAM101] states that where v3 is the hyperbolic volume of the ideal regular hyperbolic tetrahedron, and [formula] denotes the simplicial volume. Note that this conjecture was first proposed by R. Kashaev [\cite=Kashaev:LETMP97] in a different way. It is generalized by S. Gukov [\cite=Gukov:03] to a relation of the limit

[formula]

with a fixed complex number a to the A-polynomial of K [\cite=Cooper/Culler/Gillet/Long/Shalen:INVEM1994], and the volume and the Chern-Simons invariant of a three-manifold obtained by Dehn surgery along K. See also [\cite=Murakami:KYUMJ2004] [\cite=Murakami/Yokota:2004] about the generalized volume conjecture for the figure-eight knot.

On the other hand, the author proved also in [\cite=Murakami:KYUMJ2004] that the limit [\eqref=eq:limit] vanishes for the figure-eight knot if a is real and [formula] or a is purely imaginary and |a| < π / 3. S. Garoufalidis and T. Le proved [\cite=Garoufalidis/Le:2005] that for any knot K, [\eqref=eq:limit] vanishes if a is purely imaginary and sufficiently small. This shows that the series [formula] grows polynomially when a is small. One may ask whether the series diverges or not.

In this paper we study the 'genuine' limit lim N  →    ∞JN(E; exp (a / N)) for the figure-eight knot E when a is a small complex number, and show that the limit does exist and equals the inverse of its Alexander polynomial. More precisely we will show the following equality.

Let E be the figure-eight knot. If a is a complex number with |2 cosh a - 2| < 1 and [formula], then the series [formula] converges and where Δ(E;t) =  - t + 3 - t- 1 is the Alexander polynomial of E.

The range [formula] looks like an 'oval' (not a mathematical one) around the origin whose boundary goes through the four points [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] on the Gaussian plane (see Lemma [\ref=lem:cosh]). The author does not know whether this 'oval' is the 'circle of convergence' or not.

Note that the inequality |2 cosh a - 2| < 1 is equal to |Δ(E; exp a) - 1| < 1. This may suggest another relation between the colored Jones polynomials and the Alexander polynomial.

Proof

We first recall the formula of the figure-eight knot due to K. Habiro and Le [\cite=Habiro:SURIK00] (see also [\cite=Masbaum:AGT03]). If we replace t with exp (a / N) we have with where

We first show that [formula] converges.

For any complex number a with |2 cosh a - 2| < 1 and [formula], the series [formula] converges.

From Lemmas [\ref=lem:cosh_ua_va] and [\ref=lem:cosh_ua], we have the following inequalities for 0 < M < N:

[formula]

where we put δ: = |2 cosh a - 2| < 1. So we have for 0 < k < M < N, where ⌊x⌋ is the greatest integer that does not exceed x.

Putting M': = ⌊εM⌋ we have From Lemma [\ref=lem:ExpIntegralE], this is equal to

[formula]

Note that since the last term in [\eqref=eq:J_N-J_M] can be arbitrarily small.

Since we can apply Laplace's method to study the asymptotic behavior for large M: (See for example [\cite=Olver:1974].) Therefore [formula] can be arbitrarily small if M is sufficiently large, which means that the sequence [formula] is a Cauchy sequence and so it converges.

Now that we know the convergence, we use an inhomogeneous recursion formula of JN(E;t) to find the limit. It is known that JN(E;t) satisfies the following formula [\cite=Garoufalidis/Le:2003] (see also [\cite=Gelca/Sain:JKNOT2004] for a homogeneous recursion formula).

[formula]

We want to show that the series [formula] and [formula] also converge and both limits coincide with that of [formula].

For l = 1 or 2, put

[formula]

so that [formula].

The series [formula] converges and shares the limit with [formula].

From Lemma [\ref=lem:cosh_ua_va] and Corollary [\ref=cor], we have

From Lemma [\ref=lem:cosh_x] there exists a positive number ε' such that if j / N < ε' then Putting [formula], we have if j / N < ε' and so if k / N < ε'.

Therefore we have which can be arbitrarily small when N is sufficiently large, since 0 < δ < 1. So the series [formula] (l = 1 or 2) converges and its limit is equal to that of [formula].

Therefore putting [formula] and w: =  exp a, we have from [\eqref=eq:recursion] So we finally have winch is equal to 1 / Δ(E; exp a).

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm].

We used an inhomogeneous recursion formula for the colored Jones polynomial of the figure-eight knot. Note that Garoufalidis and Le proved that there always exists a homogeneous formula for any knot [\cite=Garoufalidis/Le:2003].

The relation between the A-polynomial and the Alexander polynomial [\cite=Cooper/Culler/Gillet/Long/Shalen:INVEM1994], the AJ-conjecture proposed by Garoufalidis [\cite=Garoufalidis:GEOTO2004], and Theorem [\ref=thm] suggest that for any knot K if the series [formula] converges for some a, then the limit would be 1 / Δ(K; exp a) with Δ(K;t) the Alexander polynomial of K.

In [\cite=Murakami:INTJM62004] the author proved that for any torus knot T, lim N  →    ∞JN(T; exp a  /  N) = 1 / Δ(T; exp a) if a is near [formula] and [formula].

P. Melvin and H. Morton [\cite=Melvin/Morton:COMMP95] observed the following formal power series:

[formula]

and conjectured the following (Melvin-Morton-Rozansky conjecture).

bjk(K) = 0 if k > j, and

[formula].

This conjecture was 'proved' by L. Rozansky [\cite=Rozansky:COMMP96] non-rigorously, and proved by D. Bar-Natan and Garoufalidis ([\cite=BarNatan/Garoufalidis:INVEM96]).

Replacing h with a / N, we have from (i) and (ii)

[formula]

So we may regard Theorem [\ref=thm] as an analytic version of the Melvin-Morton-Rozansky conjecture.

Appendix

In this appendix we give several technical lemmas used in the paper.

For a complex number [formula] with x, [formula], the condition |2 cosh a - 2| < 1 is equivalent to the condition cosh x  -   cos y < 1 / 2.

Since [formula], and [formula], we have | cosh a - 1| =  cosh x  -   cos y.

Especially we have [formula].

If a complex number a satisfies |2 cosh a - 2| < 1 and [formula], then for any real number u with 0 < u < 1, we have | cosh ua - 1| < | cosh a - 1|.

From Lemma [\ref=lem:cosh], cosh x  -   cos y < 1 / 2 with [formula]. Since cosh x is increasing (decreasing, respectively) for x > 0 (x < 0, respectively) and cos y is decreasing (increasing, respectively) for 0 < y < π / 3 (0 > y >  - π / 3, respectively), we have

[formula]

For a complex number a with |2 cosh a - 2| < 1 and [formula], and real numbers u and v with 0  ≤  u < v < 1, we have Moreover the equality holds only when a = 0.

It is clear that both hand sides are equal when a = 0. So we assume [formula] and prove the strict inequality.

Put [formula] with (x,y)  ≠  (0,0) and |y| < π / 3.

We will show that [formula] is decreasing with respect to u for 0 < u < 1. Since φ(x,y,u) = φ( - x,y,u) = φ(x, - y,u), we may assume that [formula] and [formula]. Since we have Put

[formula]

We will show

φ1(x,y,u) > 0 when x > 0 and [formula], and

φ2(x,y,u) > 0 when [formula] and y > 0.

First we will show (1). Note that if x > 0, φ1(x,0,u) =  sinh ux( cosh x  -   cosh ux) > 0, and so we will assume that y > 0.

Since φ1(0,y,u) = 0, it is sufficient to show that is positive when x > 0, π / 3 > y > 0, and 1 > u > 0. Note that is positive since its partial derivative with respect to y is [formula], which is positive. Moreover we have since 0 < u < 1 and [formula] for 0 < z < π / 3. Therefore ∂  φ1(x,y,u) / ∂  x is also positive.

Next we will show (2). Note that if π / 3 > y > 0, φ2(0,y,u) =  sin uy( cos uy  -   cos y) > 0, and so we will assume that x > 0. Since φ2(x,y,0) = 0, it is sufficient to show that is positive when x > 0, π / 3 > y > 0, and 1 > u > 0. The first term is clearly positive and so we will show that u sin y cos uy  -   sin uy cos y is positive. But this can be easily verified since it is 0 when y = 0 and its derivative with respect to y is [formula], which is positive.

There exists a positive number ε such that for a complex number [formula] with [formula] and [formula], and a real number u with 0 < u < ε, we have

We will show that if 0 < u < ε. Putting [formula] with |x| < π and [formula], the left hand side equals Since it remains the same if we alter the signs of x or y, we may assume that [formula] and [formula] ((x,y)  ≠  (0,0)). Put

[formula]

We will show that α1(x,y,u), α2(x,y,u), β1(x,y,u), and β2(x,y,u) are all positive.

Since 0 < u < 1, sinh x is increasing for any x, and sin y is increasing when 0  ≤  y < π / 3, we have

By the Taylor expansion of α2(x,y,u) around x = 0, we have Since sin y is increasing for 0 < y < π / 3 and 0 < u < 1, we have sin y - u2n sin uy > 0. Therefore α2(x,y,u) > 0.

The Taylor expansions of β1(x,y,u) and β2(x,y,u) around u = 0 give

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Therefore β(x,y,u) is positive for small u if [formula].

When cosh x cos y = 1 we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

cosh x cos x < 1 for 0 < x < π, which means that x  ≠  y when cosh x cos y = 1. So β(x,y,u) > 0 for small u since the coefficient of u4 in [\eqref=eq:beta] is positive.

Thus we have concluded that β(x,y,u) > 0 for small u.

For a positive integer m and a positive real number a, we have

Integration by parts gives and the proof is complete.

For a complex number a with |2 cosh a - 2| < 1, [formula], and [formula], there exists a positive number ε' > 0 such that if 0 < x < ε' and 0 < u < ε', then

Using the Taylor expansion with respect to x and u around x = u = 0, we have where Ra(u,x) is the terms with total degrees of u and x are greater than two.

From Lemma [\ref=lem:Re_a], we have if x and u are sufficiently small.

Moreover we have From Lemma [\ref=lem:Re_a^2], we have [formula] if |2 cosh a - 2| < 1, and the other inequality follows.

For a complex number [formula] with [formula], we have

We put [formula] with |y| < π. Then we have if |y| < π and (x,y)  ≠  (0,0).

For a complex number [formula] with |2 cosh a - 2| < 1 and [formula], we have

Putting [formula] with [formula], we have with

We will show that f(x,y) > 0. We may assume [formula], [formula] ((x,y)  ≠  (0,0)) as before. Since when x > 0, we will assume that y > 0.

Since f(x,y) is analytic, it is sufficient to prove that every nth derivative of f at x = 0 is positive when n is even and zero when n is odd.

Since

[formula]

we have It is clear that - y2( cos 2y  -   cos y) > 0 since y < π / 3. If n if even and [formula], then since y < π / 3 we have To show that is positive, we will consider the function g(y): =  - 2y2 + 2( cos 2y  -   cos y) + 4y sin y. Since is easily verified to be positive, we have g(y) > 0. So [formula] is also positive.
