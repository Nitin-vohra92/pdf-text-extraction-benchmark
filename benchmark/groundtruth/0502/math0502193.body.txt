Mahler Measure Variations, Eisenstein Series and Instanton Expansions.

Introduction

The logarithmic Mahler measure [formula] and the Mahler measure [formula] of a Laurent polynomial F(x,y) with complex coefficients are:

[formula]

Wondering how the Mahler measure depends on the coefficients of the Laurent polynomial, and more in particular on the constant term, we will look at the Mahler measure [formula] of Laurent polynomials

[formula]

where [formula] is a fixed weighted homogeneous polynomial and t is a complex variable. Geometrically speaking, we look at the Mahler measure of the fibres of the map [formula], (X,Y,Z)  ↦  [null] on the (weighted) projective plane [formula]. In the examples these fibres are elliptic curves. The variation in the Mahler measure is then related to the variation in the periods, or rather the period ratio, of these elliptic curves (see §[\ref=Section_1]). This is what Rodriguez Villegas was investigating when he noticed that some of his formulas looked similar to formulas in the literature on Mirror Symmetry; see the final remarks in [\cite=RV]. The modest goal of the present paper is to point out that actual instanton expansions matching his examples do occur in the physics literature [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV] [\cite=KZ] [\cite=CKYZ]. The relation is, however, more intriguing and less straightforward than one might expect from the remarks in [\cite=RV]:

Observation: The expansions [formula] of the weight 3 modular forms in Examples 1,  2,  3 of [\cite=RV] are related to the instanton expansions [formula] in Examples E6,  E5,  E8, respectively, in [\cite=KMV] [\cite=LMW], via the inverse function relations

[formula]

The constant κ is - 3, - 4, - 1 for Examples E6,  E5,  E8, respectively.

The Mahler measure of the elliptic curve with modular parameter [formula] is [formula] with ν = 3,  2,  6 for Examples E6,  E5,  E8, respectively. [formula]

That Examples 1,  2,  3 of [\cite=RV] line up with Examples E6,  E5,  E8 in [\cite=KMV] [\cite=LMW] is immediately obvious from the formulas for the elliptic pencils and their Picard-Fuchs equations which are explicitly given in [\cite=KMV] [\cite=LMW] [\cite=RV]. Looking at how the various authors get from the Picard-Fuchs equations to their expansions directly leads to Relation ([\ref=eq:Qqintro]); for more details see Section [\ref=Section_1].

In Section [\ref=section_examples] we present six such examples including the above ones and the E7 case of [\cite=KMV] [\cite=LMW]. In each case the computer output suggests that the numbers an and bn are integers. Except for the bn in four examples we have no proof for this suggested integrality.

Discussion and new directions. While the second product in ([\ref=eq:Qqintro]) summarizes some of results (instanton expansions) in the String Theory literature of the 1990's, Mahler measure and an analogue of the first product in ([\ref=eq:Qqintro]) appear in the String related literature of the 2000's. Theorem 3.5 of [\cite=KOS], for instance, gives a formula for the partition function of a dimer model which is exactly the same as the defining formula ([\ref=eq:mahler]) for the Mahler measure of the characteristic polynomial of that model. In [\cite=S2] we show that the polynomials of Examples [formula] 3, [formula] 4 and [formula] 6 of the present paper are characteristic polynomials of dimer models. The partition functions of these dimer models can therefore be given as the multiplicative inverses of the first products in ([\ref=eq:Qqintro]). For Example [formula] 3, for instance, this product is

[formula]

There is here some similarity with McMahon's function

[formula]

which appears in partition functions in [\cite=O] [\cite=ORV]. The fact that McMahon's function is the generating function for plane partitions (i.e. with 3 dimensional Young diagrams) led to unexpected new directions in String Theory research: the melting crystal and random surface pictures [\cite=KOS] [\cite=O] [\cite=ORV].

Details of the Observation

We investigate Laurent polynomials of the form

[formula]

with t a complex parameter and [formula] as in Table [\ref=table_1]. Writing ξ = t- 1 and assuming [formula] one then finds

[formula]

with

[formula]

and β an as yet undetermined complex number of absolute value 1. The number β is, of course, irrelevant for ([\ref=eq:mahlerQ]), but for the correct match with [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV] it will be necessary to take here an appropriate ξ-independent constant.

Thus

[formula]

with

[formula]

We refer to Table [\ref=table_2] for concrete examples. Now let [formula] denote the closure of

[formula]

in the (appropriately weighted) projective plane. Restricting to values of t = ξ- 1 for which the curve [formula] is non-singular, differentiating ([\ref=eq:period1]) and using the residue theorem one finds

[formula]

where γ is a closed loop and ωt is a holomorphic 1-form on the curve [formula],

[formula]

on the coordinate patch where the denominator does not vanish.

Thus [formula] is a period of ωt. The periods of ωt are functions of ξ = t- 1 which satisfy a second order linear differential equation: the Picard-Fuchs equation of the elliptic pencil. In our examples there is only one solution g1(ξ) of the Picard-Fuchs equation which is holomorphic in a neighborhood of ξ = 0 and has g1(0) = 1. Differentiating ([\ref=eq:Qxi]) shows that this solution is

[formula]

A second solution has the form

[formula]

where h(ξ) is a holomorphic function of ξ which vanishes at ξ = 0. The classical procedure in analyzing elliptic pencils is to consider the period ratio and to set

[formula]

Formulas ([\ref=eq:Qxi]) and ([\ref=eq:qxi]) give Q and q as functions of ξ, while

[formula]

One can eliminate ξ and directly express Q as a function of q and vice versa. Although, one could now express this inverse function relationship through product expansions as in ([\ref=eq:Qqintro]), it is better to wait: in the examples there is a positive integer ν (see Table [\ref=table_2]) such that Qν is a function of qν and vice versa. It is this latter inverse function relationship which is used in ([\ref=eq:Qqintro]) with

[formula]

Here are more details about the role of ν. One solution of the Picard-Fuchs differential equation is:

[formula]

with ψ  =  ξν, um and cn as in Table [\ref=table_2]. The numbers um and (A,B,λ) in Table [\ref=table_2] satisfy the recurrence relation

[formula]

This can easily be checked by hand for the hypergeometric cases [formula] 1-[formula] 4. The recurrence in case [formula] 5 is due to Apéry; the numbers um appear in his famous irrationality proof for ζ(2). The recurrence in case [formula] 6 is due to Cusick. Proofs for the recurrences in cases [formula] 5 and [formula] 6 (which in fact first derive the Picard-Fuchs equation) can be found in, for instance, [\cite=SB] § 11. The (A,B,λ)-notation was introduced by Zagier [\cite=Z], who made an extensive search for all such triples for which all um in the recurrence ([\ref=eq:recurrence]) are integers.

The recurrence relation ([\ref=eq:recurrence]) is equivalent with the differential equation

[formula]

for the generating function g1 in ([\ref=eq:generating]). A second solution of the differential equation ([\ref=eq:differential]) can be obtained by the method of Frobenius. For this we make the Ansatz

[formula]

This is a solution of ([\ref=eq:differential]) if and only if ε2 = 0 and for all m  ≥  0

[formula]

We set u0(ε) = 1, solve the recurrrence and then expand

[formula]

Then g1(ψ) and g2(ψ) are solutions of ([\ref=eq:differential]), [formula] as before and g2(ψ) = g1(ψ) log ψ + h(ψ) where h(ψ) is a power series in ψ with h(0) = 0. Now set, with ν as in Table [\ref=table_2],

[formula]

This definition of q agrees with ([\ref=eq:qxi]), but note that [formula] is actually a function of ψ  =  ξν and [formula].

Now recall ([\ref=eq:period3]) and ([\ref=eq:generating]):

[formula]

This shows that [formula] is actually a function of ψ and that [formula] for some constant α. One can eliminate ψ and directly express [formula] as a function of [formula] and vice versa. This is the inverse function relationship used in ([\ref=eq:Qqintro]), with α =  - 1.

By comparing the above formulas for [formula] and for [formula] with the formulas in [formula]13 of [\cite=RV] one sees that our [formula] equals Rodriguez Villegas' e(τ), which in the examples has an expansion like an Eisenstein series of weight 3:

[formula]

Note that ([\ref=eq:period3]) determines [formula] only up to a multiplicative constant. This constant is irrelevant for the expansion ([\ref=eq:dQdq]). On the other hand, for [\cite=LMW] fixing this constant is very relevant. It is called fixing the B-field. Equations (4.10) and (4.13) of [\cite=LMW] essentially boil down to

[formula]

to really get the expansions of [\cite=LMW] Equation (4.10) the right hand side of ([\ref=eq:dqdQ]) has to be multiplied by an appropriate constant (see the numerical results in the next section).

With ([\ref=eq:dQdq]) and ([\ref=eq:dqdQ]) one can express [formula] as a function of [formula] and vice versa, both up to a multiplicative constant. These constants are fixed by

[formula]

Thus one arrives at the following functional relation between [formula] and [formula]:

[formula]

Incidentally, the relation between the α here and the β in ([\ref=eq:period1]) is: α  =  βν. In the examples α  =    ±  1 and all an and bn turn out to be integers. Except for some of the bn we have no proof for this integrality.

Numerical results for six examples.

Our examples deal with pencils of elliptic curves in a (weighted) projective plane [formula] described by the polynomials in Table [\ref=table_1]:

[formula]

Beauville [\cite=Beau] showed that there are exactly six semi-stable families of elliptic curves over [formula] with four singular fibres. His list consists of cases [formula] 3 - [formula] 6 in our Table [\ref=table_1] plus the polynomials (X + Y)((X + Y + Z)2 - 4YZ) and X3 + Y3 + Z3. We do not explicitly discuss the latter two, since the results coincide with those of [formula] 4 resp. [formula] 3.

Table [\ref=table_2] shows that cases [formula] 1 - [formula] 4 are of hypergeometric origin; more precisely they result by a substution t  ↦  t6,t4,t3,t2, respectively, from elliptic pencils with exactly three singular fibres. Families of elliptic curves with exactly three singular fibres have been classified in [\cite=SH]. From the tables in [\cite=SH] one can see that our examples come from the singular fibre configurations [formula] [formula]. Kodaira's notation for the singular fibres corresponds as follows with Dynkin diagrams: II*  =  E8, III*  =  E7, IV*  =  E6, I*1  =  E5 = D5. This agrees with the computations hereafter according to which examples [formula] 1 -[formula] 4 give cases E8,E7,E6,E5 in [\cite=KMV] [\cite=LMW].

We now come to the actual calculations (using PARI). From the input in the form of the triple (A,B,λ) we compute g1 and [formula] as functions of ψ using Formulas ([\ref=eq:epsrecur])-([\ref=eq:q]). Inverting the latter functional relation we get ψ and g1 as functions of [formula]. The numbers bn are then computed from the expansion (cf. ([\ref=eq:dQdq]), ([\ref=eq:dQdpsi]))

[formula]

Having the numbers bn we compute [formula] and the numbers an from ([\ref=eq:Qq]):

[formula]

Typically α =  - 1 leads to the numbers which are reported in [\cite=LMW] Equations (4.10); for the conifold case, though, α = 1, as remarked in loc. cit..

We report the results of the calculations in tables for the numbers an and bn and as η-products or Eisenstein series for [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The elliptic pencils and Picard-Fuchs equations of Examples [formula] 3-[formula] 6 are well-known and well documented in the literature [\cite=Z] [\cite=RV]; also [formula] 1 appears in [\cite=RV] as example 3. So we have taken the expressions for [formula] and [formula] directly from [\cite=Z] [\cite=RV]. Zagier [\cite=Z] gives an argument for "recognizing modularity" which actually proves that the expressions are correct. However, as an extra security check we have checked that the [formula]-expansions of these expressions coincide with our PARI calculations to order at least 100.

[formula] 1: (A,B,λ) = (432,0,60)  ,  α =  - 1.

This corresponds to the E8 example in [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV] and Example 3 in [\cite=RV].

[formula]

The numbers of an are the instanton numbers of [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV] Example E8. They also appear in [\cite=CKYZ] Table 7 column X6(1123). More precisely the expansion for the E8 case in [\cite=LMW] Eq. (4.10) is:

[formula]

Rodriguez Villegas [\cite=RV] Example 3 gives the following expressions for, in our notation, [formula], [formula] and [formula]:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the Eisenstein series

[formula]

[formula] 2: (A,B,λ) = (64,0,12)  ,  α =  - 1.

This corresponds to the E7 example in [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV], but has no explicitly worked out counterpart in [\cite=RV].

[formula]

The numbers of 2an are the instanton numbers of [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV] Example E7. They also appear in [\cite=CKYZ] Table 7 column X4(1112). More precisely the expansion for the E7 case in [\cite=LMW] Eq. (4.10) is:

[formula]

Here we can only offer (without reference to proofs in the literature) expressions for [formula], [formula] and [formula], which are correct to at least [formula]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula] 3: (A,B,λ) = (27,0,6)  ,  α =  - 1.

This corresponds to the E6 example in [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV] and Example 1 in [\cite=RV].

[formula]

The numbers of 3an are the instanton numbers of [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV] Example E6. The numbers [formula] appear in [\cite=CKYZ] Table 1 and in [\cite=KZ] Fig. 2. More precisely the expansion for the E6 case in [\cite=LMW] Eq. (4.10) is:

[formula]

Zagier [\cite=Z] and Rodriguez Villegas [\cite=RV] give the following expressions for, in our notation, [formula], [formula] and [formula]:

[formula]

where χ- 3 denotes the quadratic Dirichlet character [formula], i.e.

[formula]

According to [\cite=ABYZ] one also has [formula]

[formula] 4: (A,B,λ) = (16,0,4)  ,  α =  - 1.

This corresponds to the E5 example in [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV] and Example 2 in [\cite=RV].

[formula]

The numbers of 4an are the instanton numbers of [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV] Example E5. More precisely the expansion for the E5 case in [\cite=LMW] Eq. (4.10) is:

[formula]

Zagier [\cite=Z] and Rodriguez Villegas [\cite=RV] give the following expressions for, in our notation, [formula], [formula] and [formula]:

[formula]

where χ- 4 denotes the quadratic Dirichlet character [formula], i.e.

[formula]

According to [\cite=ABYZ] one also has [formula]

Remark: Taking (A,B,λ) = (16,0,4)  ,  α = 1 leads to the instanton numbers of [\cite=LMW] Example Conifold.

[formula] 5: (A,B,λ) = (11, - 1,3)  ,  α =  - 1.

This example does not appear in [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV] or [\cite=RV].

[formula]

Zagier [\cite=Z] gives for [formula] and [formula] the expressions

[formula]

where [formula] is the quadratic character and χ is the quartic character [formula], i.e.

[formula]

the latter congruence can also be written as [formula] in [formula].

From this we infer

[formula]

[formula] 6: (A,B,λ) = (7, - 8,2)  ,  α =  - 1.

This example does not appear in [\cite=LMW] [\cite=KMV] or [\cite=RV].

[formula]

Zagier [\cite=Z] gives for [formula] and [formula] the expressions

[formula]

From this one then obtains

[formula]

Here [formula] and [formula] are the same as in Example [formula] 3. Note that bn  =  ( - 1)n - 1χ- 3(n).
