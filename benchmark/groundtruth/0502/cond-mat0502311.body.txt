Interpretation of the "S-shaped" temperature dependence of luminescent peaks from semiconductors

Anomalous temperature dependence of luminescence peak position has been frequently observed in semiconductors. [\cite=ChoYH1998-APL73:1370] [\cite=EliseevPG1997-APL71:569] [\cite=GrenouilletL2000-APL76:2241] [\cite=HongYG2003-APL83:5446] [\cite=YuHB2004-CPL21:1323] [\cite=BellA2004-JAP95:4670] [\cite=CaoXA2003-APL82:3614] [\cite=OlsthoornSM1993-JAP73:7798] A typical such phenomenon is so-called "S-shaped" temperature dependence. That is, as the temperature continuously increases, the luminescence peak redshifts first, then blueshifts, finally redshifts again. This unusual temperature dependence of luminescence peak significantly deviates from that predicted by either the Varshni [\cite=VarshniYP1967-Physica34:149] or Bose-Einstein [\cite=VinaL1984-PRB30:1979] formula. For an ideally perfect semiconductor, these formula predict a monotonic decrease of the semiconductor band gap with increasing temperature. The "S-shaped" temperature-induced shift of luminescence peak has been known to be closely related to the carrier localization in semiconductors for a long time. [\cite=ChoYH1998-APL73:1370] Several attempts have been made to interpret the phenomenon. For example, a band-tail emission model was proposed by Eliseev et al. [\cite=EliseevPG1997-APL71:569] to explain the frequently observed blueshift of the emission peak in InGaN QWs at higher temperatures. However, to our best knowledge, no a model can reproduce the "S-shaped" shift.

In this letter, starting from a newly developed luminescence model for localized state ensemble, [\cite=LiQ2001-APL79:1810] [\cite=LiQ-cond-mat-0411128] we quantitatively interpret the "S-shaped" temperature dependence of luminescence peaks from several representative materials. It is found that the redistribution of carriers within the localized states due to the transfer between different localized states and the thermal escape of carriers from the higher energy states leads to the occurrence of the "S-shaped" temperature dependence of the luminescence paek. Excellent agreement between the theoretical calculation and the experimental data is achieved over the whole studied temperature range.

Figure [\ref=Fig:S-shape] shows the luminescence peak positions against temperature for four different materials of InGaAsN, [\cite=GrenouilletL2000-APL76:2241] GaInNP, [\cite=HongYG2003-APL83:5446] InGaN, [\cite=YuHB2004-CPL21:1323] and AlGaN [\cite=BellA2004-JAP95:4670]. The solid squares represent the experimental data while the solid lines are the calculated results using the model described in detail in ref. [\cite=LiQ-cond-mat-0411128]. The emission colors of these materials vary from ultraviolet (AlGaN, 3.9 eV) to near-infrared (InGaAsN, 0.965 eV). In these materials, the emission spectra are from the radiative recombination of the localized excitons due to either large-scale inhomogeneity in composition or the N-induced localized states. [\cite=GrenouilletL2000-APL76:2241] [\cite=HongYG2003-APL83:5446] [\cite=YuHB2004-CPL21:1323] [\cite=BellA2004-JAP95:4670] [\cite=JohnsonNM2000-PT53:31] Considering the radiative recombination, thermal escape, and re-capture of the excitons in a localized state ensemble, we derive a distribution function of localized carriers from a rate equation under quasi-steady state. [\cite=LiQ-cond-mat-0411128] Assuming that the localized state ensemble has a Gaussian-type energetic distribution of density of states, the luminescence spectrum of the localized excitons is found. The temperature dependence of the luminescence peak positions can be given by [\cite=LiQ-cond-mat-0411128]

[formula]

where the second term on the right describes the bandgap shrinking according to Varshni's empirical formula. α is the Varshni's parameter and Θ the Debye temperature. The third term represents the effect of thermal redistribution of localized carriers. kB is the Boltzmann constant. The dimensionless coefficient x(T) can be obtained by numerically solving the following equation [\cite=LiQ-cond-mat-0411128] [\cite=LiQ2001-APL79:1810]

[formula]

where E0 and σ are the central energy and broadening parameter for the distribution of the localized states, respectively. 1 / τtr is the escape rate and 1 / τr the radiative recombination rate of the localized carriers. Like the Fermi level in the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, Ea gives a special energy level below which the localized states are occupied by the excitons at 0 K. It is shown that the magnitude and sign of Ea - E0 strongly affect the temperature dependence of the luminescence paek. When Ea - E0 is taken a negative value, the "S-shaped" temperature dependence (the solid lines) of the luminescence peak can be well produced, as shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig:S-shape]. The parameters adopted in the calculations are summarized in Table [\ref=Tab:parameters].

As mentioned earlier, Ea - E0 plays an important role in determining the temperature behavior of the luminescence peak of the localized excitons, particularly in the low temperature region. As the central energetic position of the localized state distribution, E0 is determined for a given material. However, the energetic position of Ea is found to be dependent on both the concentration of carriers and the magnitude of the built-in electric field in the material. The magnitude and even the sign of Ea - E0 can thus be changed through internally or externally adjusting the carrier density and the electric field. Figure [\ref=Fig:Eliseev] shows the electroluminescence peak positions (various symbols) as a function of temperature and injected current in InGaN single-quantum-well light-emitting-diode, reported by Eliseev at al..[\cite=EliseevPG1997-APL71:569] The solid curves are the calculated results using Eqs. ([\ref=eq:peak-position]) and ([\ref=eq:solve-x]). Excellent agreement between the theoretical results and the experimental data was obtained. The values of the parameters used in the calculations are also listed in Table [\ref=Tab:parameters]. From the table, an interesting observation is that the magnitude of Ea - E0 systematically varies with increasing the injected electrical current during the measurements. It is known that the increase of the injected electric current can result in the increase of the carrier concentration. On the other hand, the increase of the injected electric current may cause a strength decrease of the effective electric field in the diode due to the screening out effect of the electrically injected carriers on the existing huge piezoelectric field. [\cite=TakeuchiT1997-JJAPP236:382] [\cite=TakeuchiT1998-APL73:1691] [\cite=BernardiniF1997-PRB56:10024] [\cite=WetzelC2000-PRB61:2159] [\cite=LefebvreP2001-APL78:1252] [\cite=SalaFD1999-APL74:2002] [\cite=LiQ2002-JJAPP241:L1093] Since the energetic position of Ea is dependent on both the carrier concentration and the magnitude of the effective electric field, it is not difficult for one to understand that the magnitude of Ea - E0 changes with the injected electric current.

An interesting phenomenon in Fig. [\ref=Fig:Eliseev] is that the originally scattered electroluminescence peaks in low temperature region for the different injected currents tend to converge at high temperatures. Figure [\ref=Fig:Eliseev2](A) depicts the spectral peak positions of a blue InGaN single-quantum-well light-emitting-diode at several different temperatures as a function of the injected current. [\cite=EliseevPG2003] At 70 and 100 K, the peak position increases as the injected current increases. However, when the temperature ≥   125 K, a plateau region appears. In other words, the peak position does not change with the injected current in the region. This indicates that at higher temperatures, the influence of the magnitude of Ea - E0 on the temperature dependence of the peak positions will become weaker. This strange behavior can be well interpreted using Eqs. ([\ref=eq:peak-position]) and ([\ref=eq:solve-x]). At high temperatures, the solution of Eq. ([\ref=eq:solve-x]) can be found to be x  ≈  (σ / kBT)2 and Eq. ([\ref=eq:peak-position]) becomes [\cite=LiQ-cond-mat-0411128] [\cite=LiQ2001-APL79:1810]

[formula]

Note that Ea - E0 does not appear in the above equation, which indicates that the peak positions are no longer dependent on Ea - E0 at the high temperatures. Figure [\ref=Fig:Eliseev2](B) shows the calculated peak positions as a function of Ea - E0 for different temperatures using Eqs. ([\ref=eq:peak-position]) and ([\ref=eq:solve-x]). Compared Fig. 3(A) with (B), it can be concluded that the behaviors in the experimental data is quantitatively produced by the theoretical calculations.

In conclusions, the "S-shaped" temperature dependence of the luminescence peak positions, which is a frequently observed phenomenon in many semiconductors, is successfully modeled using a recently developed luminescence model for localized state ensemble. The energetic difference between the quasi-Fermi level (Ea) and the central energy (E0) of the localized state distribution essentially determines the details of temperature behavior of the luminescence peaks. The model could be useful for experimentalists to quantitatively explain their experimental results in temperature dependent luminescence studies.
