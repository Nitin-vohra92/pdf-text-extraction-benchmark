The first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator on locally reducible Riemannian manifolds

Introduction

Let M be a compact Riemannian spin manifold with positive scalar curvature s. A well known consequence of the Schrödinger-Lichnerowicz formula [\cite=S] [\cite=L]

[formula]

is the Lichnerowicz vanishing theorem [\cite=L]: the kernel of the Dirac operator D coincides with the space of parallel spinors. If this kernel is non-trivial, then the scalar curvature must be zero and even more, M must be Ricci-flat. The simply connected irreducible manifolds which admit parallel spinors were described by Wang [\cite=W]. They are exactly the manifolds whose holonomy group is one of SU(n), Sp(n), G2, Spin(7). For each of these cases Wang found the dimension of the space of parallel spinors.

If the scalar curvature is not identically zero, then the kernel of D is trivial. This holds true, in particular, if s > 0, which we shall assume from now on. In this case an estimate for the square of the first eigenvalue λ of the Dirac operator was obtained by Friedrich [\cite=F]:

[formula]

where n is the dimension of the manifold. The limiting case of this estimate (i.e., the case of equality in ([\ref=1])) is characterized by the existence of a non-trivial real Killing spinor on M. It was shown by Bär [\cite=B] that the last property is equivalent to the existence of a parallel spinor on the cone over M. Thus, using Wang's results, he classified the simply connected manifolds admitting real Killing spinors. They are the sphere Sn, the Einstein-Sasakian manifolds, the 3-Sasakian manifolds, the 6-dimensional nearly Kähler manifolds and the 7-dimensional manifolds with nearly parallel vector cross product [\cite=B].

The manifolds with non-trivial real Killing spinors have constant positive scalar curvature. They are furthermore Einstein, locally irreducible and their holonomy is SO(n). In particular, they do not admit any parallel k-form for [formula] [\cite=H]. This shows that the estimate ([\ref=1]) cannot be sharp, for example, on Kähler or quaternionic Kähler manifolds. Indeed, better estimates have been proved in these cases by Kirchberg [\cite=K1] [\cite=K2] and Kramer, Semmelmann, Weingart [\cite=KSW] respectively.

Another situation in which ([\ref=1]) is not sharp was considered by the author, G. Grantcharov and S. Ivanov. In [\cite=AGI] they showed that if M admits a non-trivial parallel 1-form, then

[formula]

and the universal cover of a manifold, on which the first eigenvalue is the smallest possible, is a Riemannian product [formula], where N is a simply connected manifold with a real Killing spinor. (In fact, it was proved by Moroianu and Ornea [\cite=MO] that the same holds true under the weaker assumption that the 1-form is harmonic and has constant length.)

A manifold with a non-trivial parallel 1-form is locally a product of a 1-dimensional and an (n - 1)-dimensional manifold. In [\cite=Kim] Kim considered the more general situation where the manifold is locally a product of Riemannian manifolds of arbitrary dimensions n1 and n2. More precisely, he proved the following generalization of ([\ref=2]). Let the tangent bundle [formula], where T1 and T2 are parallel, dim Ti  =  ni, i = 1,2, and n1  ≤  n2. Then the first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator satisfies

[formula]

Kim also gave examples of manifolds on which the equality in ([\ref=3]) is attained. These are global products M  =  M1  ×  M2, where dim M1  =  n1, dim M2  =  n2, M2 admits a real Killing spinor and M1 has a parallel spinor if n1  <  n2 or either a parallel or a real Killing spinor if n1  =  n2. In [\cite=Kim] Kim stated the question of whether these examples give the general form of the universal coverings of the manifolds on which the limiting case of ([\ref=3]) occurs.

In the present paper we show that the answer of this question is positive. More generally, we consider manifolds which are locally a product of k Riemannian manifolds and find an estimate for the first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator. We also describe the universal covers of the manifolds on which the limiting case of this estimate is attained. We summarize our results in the following theorem. Notice that the estimate ([\ref=4]) contains ([\ref=1]), ([\ref=2]) and ([\ref=3]) as special cases. We remark also that nk  >  1 because of the positivity of the scalar curvature and that compact manifolds on which ([\ref=4]) is an equality do exist. For example, [formula], where Mi, [formula], is a compact manifold admitting a parallel spinor (e.g., [formula] (ni times)) and Mj, [formula], is a compact manifold of dimension nk admitting a real Killing spinor (e.g., Mj  =  Snk).

The proof of ([\ref=4]) uses a typical technique for such situations. We introduce certain suitable twistor operator and prove a Weitzenböck formula including this operator and the Dirac operator, which in its turn implies ([\ref=4]). This simple proof is somewhat different than the proof of ([\ref=3]) in [\cite=Kim] but its advantage is that it allows us to handle easily the limiting case.

Preliminaries

Let M be a compact Riemannian spin manifold such that the tangent bundle

[formula]

where Ti are parallel and pairwise orthogonal distributions of dimension ni, [formula].

We denote the pointwise inner products by <    ·  ,  ·    >   and the corresponding norms by |  ·  |. The global inner products will be denoted by (  ·  ,  ·  ), [formula], and the corresponding global norms by ||  ·  ||.

By [formula] we will denote an adapted local orthonormal frame, i.e., such that [formula] spans Ti. The dual frame will be denoted by [formula] [formula]. Since [formula] are parallel, we can always assume that [formula] at a fixed point x.

Another consequence of the parallelism of Ti is that R(X,Y) = 0 whenever X∈Ti, Y∈Tj with [formula].

Let si be the "scalar curvature" of Ti, i.e.,

[formula]

Hence the scalar curvature s of M is [formula].

We denote by pi the orthogonal projections from TM onto Ti and from T*M onto T*i.

Let ΣM be the spinor bundle of M, [formula] the covariant derivative of the Levi-Civita connection and [formula] the Clifford multiplication (we write also α  ·  ψ instead of [formula]). Thus the Dirac operator [formula]

We define [formula] by [formula] and Di:Γ(ΣM)  →  Γ(ΣM) by [formula], i.e., [formula]. So we have

[formula]

Next we list several formulae whose proofs are straightforward and quite similar to those of the corresponding results about the Dirac operator D.

Let X∈Γ(TM) (resp. α∈Γ(T*M)) be orthogonal to Ti (resp. T*i) and [formula] (resp. [formula]) at a given point x. Then

[formula]

This implies, in particular,

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

We also have

[formula]

and the following "partial" Schrödinger-Lichnerowicz formula

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th1]

Let [formula] be defined by

[formula]

Clearly, this definition does not depend on the choice of the adapted frame {ei,l} and [formula].

We introduce the following "adapted" twistor operator

[formula]

In other words,

[formula]

We easily see

[formula]

Using the Schrödinger-Lichnerowicz formula ([\ref=0]) and ([\ref=8]), this implies

[formula]

By ([\ref=7]) [formula]. Hence

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

Since nk  ≥  ni for each i, we obtain that the first eigenvalue λ of D satisfies ([\ref=4]). This proves the first part of the theorem.

Suppose now that for the first eigenvalue λ we have [formula] Then for each eigenspinor ψ of D for λ we have Pψ  =  0, Diψ  =  0 if ni  <  nk and s is constant on the support of ψ. But D2 is an elliptic operator of second order and it follows from [\cite=A] that each eigenspinor of D does not vanish on a dense open subset of M. Thus the scalar curvature s is constant on the whole manifold and the parallelism of Ti implies that the same is true for si, [formula].

The equation Pψ  =  0 is equivalent to

[formula]

If Diψ  =  0 (in particular, if ni  <  nk), then

[formula]

Let [formula]. This means that ni  =  nk. We can write ([\ref=10]) as

[formula]

where [formula] is the 1-form corresponding to X via the metric. Since Dψ is also an eigenspinor of D for the eigenvalue λ, ([\ref=12]) is satisfied by it too:

[formula]

Now, if X∈Γ(TM) and [formula], then ([\ref=5]) and ([\ref=6]) imply that at x

[formula]

This, together with ([\ref=12]), shows that

[formula]

By a straightforward computation, similar to the case of the usual twistor spinors, ([\ref=12]) and ([\ref=9]) yield

[formula]

In particular, by ([\ref=8]), [formula].

Let [formula]. By ([\ref=12]), ([\ref=15]) and ([\ref=16]) we obtain

[formula]

At least one of φi + and φi - is not identically zero because the same is true for ψ. Let x∈M be such that, for example, [formula]. The universal cover [formula] of M is a Riemannian product [formula] because of the decomposition ([\ref=4.5]). Let the point [formula] project on x. Denote by [formula] the inclusion [formula]. Consider the pull-back [formula] of ΣM to Mi, where [formula] is the projection. The bundle [formula] is a Clifford module on Mi and is therefore a sum of finitely many, say ri, copies of the spinor bundle ΣMi of Mi. Also the Levi-Civita connection on ΣM pulls back to the Levi-Civita connection on [formula]. Thus ([\ref=17]) implies that [formula] and each of [formula] is a real Killing spinor on Mi. Since [formula], at least one of [formula] is not identically zero. Therefore Mi admits a non-trivial real Killing spinor if [formula].

In a similar way ([\ref=11]) implies that Mi admits a non-trivial parallel spinor if Diψ  =  0.

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=th1].
