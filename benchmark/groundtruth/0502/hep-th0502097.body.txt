Introduction.

AdS/CFT correspondence is a strong/weak coupling duality. It maps the strongly coupled N = 4 Yang-Mills theory to the Type IIB superstring theory on AdS5  ×  S5. It is a useful tool for studying the dynamics of the strongly coupled Yang-Mills theory, but it would be even more important to use this duality to learn more about the string theory. AdS/CFT correspondence relates the string theory to the gauge field theory which at this time is understood much better then the string theory. It would be useful to learn how to rewrite the gauge theory in stringy degrees of freedom.

Recently the classical strings in AdS5  ×  S5 were identified on the gauge theory side as coherent states in the sector of single-trace operators with the large R-charge [\cite=FT02] [\cite=Tseytlin] [\cite=Russo] [\cite=MinahanZarembo] [\cite=FT03] [\cite=FTQ] [\cite=Kruczenski]. The dynamics of such states is essentially classical because they are composed of the large number of partons (a large number of degrees of freedom).

It was conjectured that the number of partons is in the classical limit a conserved quantity [\cite=Minahan]. We have argued in [\cite=Notes] (using the results of [\cite=ArutyunovStaudacher] [\cite=Engquist] [\cite=KT]) that this conserved quantity corresponds to a hidden symmetry of the classical string theory in AdS5  ×  S5. Classical string in AdS5  ×  S5 is an integrable system [\cite=MandalSuryanarayanaWadia] [\cite=BPR] [\cite=KMMZ] [\cite=KazakovZarembo] [\cite=BKS] [\cite=SchaferNameki]. An infinite family of local conserved charges was found by Pohlmeyer [\cite=Pohlmeyer]. The hidden symmetry corresponding to the length of the operator is generated by an action variable; it is an infinite linear combination of the Pohlmeyer charges.

In this paper we will fix the coefficients of this infinite linear combination by considering the plane wave limit [\cite=BMN]. In the plane wave limit the worldsheet theory becomes the theory of free massive fields. Our action variable in this limit counts the total number of oscillators in the excited state. We will apply the Bäcklund transformation in the plane wave limit and obtain in this limit an explicit expression for the generating function of the local conserved charges. We will find that the Pohlmeyer charges become the local conserved charges of the free massive fields, and that the oscillator number is indeed an infinite linear combination of them.

The explicit expression for the action variable and the arguments of [\cite=Anomalous] allow us to answer the following question: given the classical string worldsheet in AdS5  ×  S5, how to compute the anomalous dimension of the corresponding field theory operator? The answer is given by Eq. ([\ref=LogC]).

Integrability is a very useful feature of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and the plane wave limit provides an interesting tool for understanding the integrable structures. The worldsheet sigma-model can be understood in some regime as an integrable perturbation of the free massive theory. Integrable structure of the worldsheet theory was studied from this point of view in [\cite=Alday] [\cite=SwansonMay] [\cite=SwansonOct]. In particular, the plane wave limit of the commuting conserved charges (and the 1 / R2 corrections) was studied on the classical and quantum level in [\cite=SwansonMay] [\cite=SwansonOct]. The way we use the plane wave limit here is somewhat similar to considerations in Sections 2 and 3 of [\cite=KRT].

AdS5  ×  S5 and the plane wave.

A special choice of coordinates in AdS5  ×  S5.

Let us consider the embeddings of AdS5 as the hyperboloid [formula] and S5 as the sphere [formula]. Let [formula] denote the coordinates of [formula] and [formula] the coordinates of [formula]. The hyperboloid and the sphere are given by the equations

[formula]

The metric of AdS5  ×  S5 is:

[formula]

We will consider the string localized near the equator of the sphere. The following parametrization of AdS5  ×  S5 is useful:

[formula]

Here ε is a small parameter which is usually chosen to be of the order 1 / R. We will use the conformal coordinates on the worldsheet. This means that the embedding x(τ,σ) satisfies the constraints:

[formula]

With these constraints the equations of motion are:

[formula]

In the plane wave perturbation theory the embedding x(τ,σ) has a regular expansion in powers of ε. Let us describe the first approximation.

An approximate solution for the classical string.

Let μ be a constant parameter. There is an approximate solution for which the eight "transverse" coordinates [formula] satisfy the plane wave equations of motion

[formula]

with the constraint

[formula]

To describe this solution we have to define x+(τ,σ) and x-(τ,σ). Let us introduce the functions x- ,A(τ,σ) and x- ,S(τ,σ) defined by the equations:

[formula]

[formula]

where φ is an arbitrary function of τ,σ satisfying (∂2τ  -  ∂2σ)φ = 0. The results of the calculations in this paper do not depend on the choice of φ. We will use φ = cσ with a constant c. We put:

[formula]

This solves ([\ref=EqM]) approximately, the right hand side of ([\ref=EqM]) is of the order ε3. It is possible to modify the definition of x- ,A and x- ,S by the terms of the order ε2, so that the modified solution solves the constraints ([\ref=Virasoro]) exactly. These corrections will not spoil the equations of motion ([\ref=EqM]) in the order ε2; we will not need the explicit formula for these correcting terms in this paper.

Relation between μ and angular momentum.

The string worldsheet action in the plane wave region is:

[formula]

Here [formula] denotes the terms which do not contain time derivatives and the terms of the higher order in ε2. We will write y2 or (y,y) instead of [formula]. The vector field [formula] is a Killing vector. The corresponding momentum up to the terms of the order o(ε2) is

[formula]

The Killing vector field [formula] is periodic with the period 2π. Let us denote J the corresponding angular momentum. We have:

[formula]

The momentum corresponding to [formula] up to the terms of the order ε2 is

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Bäcklund transformations and Pohlmeyer charges.

Bäcklund transformations.

We will restrict ourselves to the case when [formula], which means that the string fluctuates only in S5; the projection of the worldsheet to AdS5 is a fixed timelike geodesic. We will discuss the general case xi  ≠  0 at the end of the paper. Consider the Bäcklund transformation which does not change the AdS part of the worldsheet X but changes the S5 part Y  →  Y':

[formula]

Here γ is a constant parameter. We will also use the notation Y(γ) = Y'. Notice that

[formula]

Let us apply the transformation Y  →  Y' in the plane wave limit. At the zeroth order in ε2 we get:

[formula]

and (Y',∂-Y) = (Y',∂+Y) + O(ε2). Eqs. ([\ref=BT]) at the zeroth order in ε2:

[formula]

This implies that [formula]. We will choose the plus sign. Let us introduce α:

[formula]

With this notation τ0' = τ0 + 2μ- 1α. Then up to the terms of the order ε2 we have:

[formula]

We can use ([\ref=ConstantAngle]) to find the transformation x- ,S  →  x- ,S':

[formula]

The parameter μ- 1 is the small parameter of the null-surface perturbation theory. In the leading order in 1 / μ we have [formula] and the Bäcklund transformation is just a time shift:

[formula]

This formula follows directly from ([\ref=BT]). We have used that ∂2τY =  - μ2Y in the limit μ  →    ∞  . Therefore we should consider μ- 1∂τ to be of the order 1 in the 1 / μ-expansion. We can define the Bäcklund transformations in the null-surface perturbation theory as perturbative solutions of ([\ref=BT]) which are power series in μ- 1, the first approximation given by ([\ref=FirstApproximation]). The corrections to ([\ref=FirstApproximation]) by the higher powers of μ- 1 involve higher derivatives in τ and σ and depend on γ as rational functions. When γ is small we can expand these corrections in powers of γ, and when γ is large in powers of γ- 1. Therefore the definition of the Bäcklund transformation as a power series in 1 / μ agrees with the usual definition as a power series in γ or 1 / γ.

Pohlmeyer charges.

The generating function for the conserved charges is given by:

[formula]

The free field y has an oscillator expansion:

[formula]

where [formula]. We will suppress the index i and write [formula] instead of [formula]. The Bäcklund transformation for the oscillators is:

[formula]

The oscillator expansion of ([\ref=GeneratingFunction]) is:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Taking into account ([\ref=MuAndJ]) we get

[formula]

This is the generating function for the "left" Pohlmeyer charges. In the generating function for the "right" charges we replace +(γ) with -(γ) which is obtained from +(γ) by replacing n  →   - n. We can also consider the average of the left and right generating functions:

[formula]

where

[formula]

A relation between E+ and E-.

Eq. ([\ref=EPlus]) can be also written in the following way:

[formula]

It is usually understood that E(γ) is the generating function of the conserved charges; it is defined as a power series in γ. But we see from ([\ref=WithLambda]) that the expansion in powers of [formula] is in fact the expansion in powers of the expression [formula] which is small in the null-surface limit μ  →    ∞  . Therefore we can analytically continue E(γ) to finite values of γ. It follows from ω2 - n2  =  μ2 that

[formula]

This identity follows from the definitions ([\ref=BT]), ([\ref=GGF]). Eq. ([\ref=BT]) defines the left Bäcklund transformation Y  →  Y'. The definition of the right Bäcklund transformation Y  →  Y'' differs from ([\ref=BT]) by ∂+  ↔  ∂-. With this definition Y'(γ) =  - Y''( - γ- 1). Now ([\ref=LeftRightSymmetry]) follows from the formula ([\ref=GGF]) for the generating function.

An action variable in the plane wave limit.

Action variable and local conserved charges of the free massive theory.

The Hamiltonian of the plane wave theory is:

[formula]

where pi(σ) = ∂τxi and qi(σ) = ∂τyi are the momenta conjugate to xi and yi respectively:

[formula]

Consider the following action variable:

[formula]

This quantity is conserved and generates periodic trajectories. In the oscillator language:

[formula]

On the other hand the free massive theory has an infinite family of local conserved charges:

[formula]

One can see that I is an infinite linear combination of Ik:

[formula]

In this section we will show that Ik descend from the Pohlmeyer charges of the sigma model on S5. We will argue that Eq.([\ref=PlaneWaveLimit]) provides an expression for the action variable in terms of the local conserved charges (which is valid not only in the plane wave limit).

Integral formula.

There is an integral formula:

[formula]

This means that:

[formula]

This is an integral representation for the action variable in terms of the conserved charges. We derived this formula in the plane wave limit, but we conjecture that it is valid also outside of the plane wave limit. In other words, the right hand side of ([\ref=Integral]) should generate periodic trajectories on the phase space of the classical string in AdS5  ×  S5.

Expansion in powers of [formula].

Let us rewrite ([\ref=Even]) in the following way:

[formula]

Notice that [formula]. Let us define the local conserved charges 2k as follows:

[formula]

One can verify the following identities:

[formula]

These equations agree with the results of [\cite=ArutyunovStaudacher] [\cite=Engquist] (see the discussion in [\cite=Notes]). In the next order we have:

[formula]

An infinite linear combination of local conserved charges.

Instead of expanding E in powers of γ let us now expand it in powers of [formula]. Define Gk as follows:

[formula]

Then Eqs. ([\ref=LocalIntegrals]) and ([\ref=WithNu]) imply that in the plane wave limit

[formula]

Therefore Gk are the "improved" currents of [\cite=ArutyunovStaudacher] [\cite=Engquist]. Indeed, the density of the k-th improved current is proportional to |pS|1 - 2k where pS  =  ∂τxS is the push-forward of [formula] by the embedding of the string worldsheet in the S5; it is assumed that τ and σ are conformal coordinates on the worldsheet and σ is periodic with the period 2π. The plane wave limit keeps the terms quadratic in y. The typical term is [formula]. In the plane wave limit |pS|≃μ and Y≃εy. Therefore in the plane wave limit this quadratic term will be of the form [formula] which is in agreement with ([\ref=PWImproved]) and ([\ref=LocalIntegrals]).

Eqs. ([\ref=EandJ]) and ([\ref=WithNu]) imply that the action variable is an infinite sum of Gk:

[formula]

We have so far considered only the S5 part of the string worldsheet. Therefore the Pohlmeyer charges Gk which we considered should be really denoted GSk. The index S tells us that these charges came from the S5 sigma model. One can introduce in the same way the Pohlmeyer charges GAk in the AdS5 sigma model. We would get:

[formula]

Here βin are the Fourier modes of xi(τ,σ). Arguments of [\cite=Anomalous] show that the anomalous dimension has the following expansion in these charges:

[formula]

We derived this expression from the plane wave limit, but it should be valid for all classical strings in AdS5  ×  S5, at least in the perturbative expansion around the null-surfaces [\cite=Notes] [\cite=KT] [\cite=Anomalous]. Eq. ([\ref=LogC]) agrees with the usual definition of the anomalous dimension in the plane wave limit as [formula].
