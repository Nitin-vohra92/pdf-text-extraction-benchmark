Absolute frequency measurement of the 7s2 1S0 -   7s7p 1P1 transition in 225Ra

Radium (Ra) is the heaviest alkaline earth metal and it offers unique possibilities for measuring parity and time reversal symmetry violation. The particular atomic and nuclear [\cite=Flambaum:1999eu] [\cite=Engel:2000jk] [\cite=Engel:2003xy] [\cite=Dzuba:2000lq] [\cite=Dobaczewski:2005qv] [\cite=BieroN:2009ty] [\cite=Dzuba:2007eu] [\cite=BieroN:2007fv] structure in Ra isotopes cause the largest enhancement for permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) [\cite=Scielzo:2006rt] in any atom. This arises from the close proximity of the 7s7p  3P1 and 7s6d 3D2 states [\cite=Flambaum:1999eu]. The exploitation of the enhancement from this 5  cm- 1 separation requires precise knowledge of Ra atomic properties such as the absolute frequencies of transitions that are relevant for laser cooling and state manipulation (see Fig. [\ref=RaLevelscheme_483nm]). Many isotopes of Ra are available from radioactive sources such as 229Th [\cite=Willmann:2012jk] [\cite=Jungmann:2003qv] [\cite=Jungmann:2006] [\cite=Guest:2007hb], or at online isotope production facilities such as ISOLDE, CERN, Switzerland [\cite=Ahmad:1983jk] [\cite=Wendt:1987].

A sensitive search for EDMs requires efficient collection of the atoms in an optical trap because of the low abundance of Ra isotopes. A strategy for efficient laser cooling and trapping has been developed with the chemical homologue barium (Ba). Exploiting the strong 6s2  1S0-6s6p  1P1 transition  [\cite=Dammalapati:2009] [\cite=De:2009nx] resulted in an efficiency of ~  1% for slowing and capturing Ba from an atomic beam, whereas capture efficiencies of below 10- 6 were reported for Ra when using the weak intercombination transition 7s2  1S0-7s7p  3P1[\cite=Guest:2007hb].

The optical spectrum of Ra was first studied by Rasmussen [\cite=Rasmussen:1934]. This identified Ra as an alkaline earth metal. Hyperfine splittings and isotope shifts were determined for the 7s2  1S0-7s7p  1,3P1 transitions by collinear laser spectroscopy [\cite=Ahmad:1983jk] [\cite=Wendt:1987] with intense Ra ion beams at ISOLDE, lifetimes of low lying states were determined in ANL, USA [\cite=Scielzo:2006rt] [\cite=Trimble:2009]; no absolute frequencies are quoted.

Here we report on a laser spectroscopy measurement of the frequency of the strong 7s2  1S0-7s7p  1P1 transition in 225Ra in an atomic beam. The laser frequency was recorded with an optical frequency comb. A set of reference lines in molecular tellurium (130Te2) were measured simultaneously. An uncertainty of about 1 MHz is achieved. This is sufficiently small for efficient laser cooling on that transition compared to the natural linewidth of 30 MHz [\cite=Dzuba:2000lq].

Doppler-free saturated absorption spectroscopy of 130Te2 provides a reliable secondary frequency standard over a wide range in the visible spectrum. The absence of nuclear spin results in a spectrum without hyperfine structure. Many of the linear absorption lines are listed in the130Te2 atlas  [\cite=TelluriumAtlas] which reports the analysis of Fourier transform spectroscopy in the wavelength range of 450 nm to 600 nm. Several lines have been independently calibrated to MHz accuracy in interferometric measurements for particular experiments, e.g. for 1S-2S transitions in hydrogen, deuterium, positronium and muonium [\cite=Boshier:1989ty] or strong lines around 500 nm [\cite=Gillaspy:1991sf]. Deviations of up to 0.003 cm- 1 (100 MHz) from the values in reference [\cite=TelluriumAtlas] have been found. This makes independent calibration of individual reference lines indispensable. The strongest Te2 line in the vicinity of the 7s2  1S0(F = 1/2)-7s7p  1P1(F = 3/2)transition in 225Ra is at 20 715.477 7 cm- 1 (Line 2004 in [\cite=TelluriumAtlas]).

Isotopically pure 130Te2 contained in a quartz cell of dimensions (100 mm ×   25 mm) is heated to temperatures between 700 K and 800 K for sufficient vapor density. The temperature is maintained by a Watlow heater element of inner diameter 50 mm and length 150 mm. It is monitored by a K-type thermocouple placed next to the cell. Light for the transitions in 225Ra and 130Te2 is obtained through second harmonic generation (SHG) by feeding light from a Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent MBR110) at wavelength 966 nm into a KNbO3 crystal inside a linear enhancement cavity (see Fig. [\ref=TeSatAbs_Setup_publication]). The light at wavelength 483 nm is focused into an acousto-optic modulator (AOM1, MT350, AA Optoelectronics) operated at frequency f[formula] = 450 MHz. It provides a frequency offset, which bridges the separation between the nearest line in 130Te2 and the transition in 225Ra. The 0[formula]-order beam from AOM1 serves for saturated absorption in Te2 and the minus first-order beam is used for spectroscopy on 225Ra. For the latter the light is overlapped with an effusive 225Ra atomic beam from an oven filled with 30  μg of 229Th (half-life 7340 y), coresponding to source strength 10 μCi. The oven is contained inside a UHV vacuum chamber with residual gas pressure below 10- 9 mbar. Typically 225Ra atoms were accumulated for one week inside the cavity of the oven, which when heated to temperature 900 K produced a flux of 106 s- 1 cm- 2 for about one hour. Optical windows for laser beam access enable the alignment of the laser beam orthogonal to the atomic Ra beam. Fluorescence light is collected through an interference filter under right angle to both beams with a photomultiplier tube (PMT).

The light for 130Te2 spectroscopy is passed through a thick beamplitter plate (BS) to provide two probe beams and one pump beam. The parallel probe beams are passed though the 130Te2 cell. The pump beam at intensity 400(50) μW/mm2 is focused into an acousto-optic modulator (AOM2) operated at f[formula] = 60 MHz. The driving rf power is chopped at f[formula] ≈   13 kHz to provide amplitude modulation of the beam. This light is overlapped on a polarizing beam splitter cube (PBS) with one of the probe beams in the 130Te2 cell. The difference in absorption for both probe beams is measured on a balanced photo detector (PD). This signal is demodulated in a lock-in amplifier to obtain the saturated absorption signal. The vapor pressure in the 130Te2 cell is monitored by linear absorption that corresponds to the Te#  3 saturated absorption line (see Fig. [\ref=TeAbs_AbsoluteTemp]). A model from [\cite=Barwood:1991xy] [\cite=Machol:1958qv] fits the data with χ2 / 5 = 1.146.

A fraction of the infrared (IR) light from the Ti:Sapphire laser overlaps with light from the frequency comb (Menlo Systems FC1500-250) on a photodiode to measure their beatnote at frequency fBN. The frequency fTe of the transition in 130Te2 is

[formula]

Here m is the mode number, frep is the repetition rate and fCEO = 20 000 000 Hz is the carrier envelope offset frequency of the comb. The long term accuracy of the frequency comb derives from a Global Positioning System (GPS) stabilized Rb clock to better than 10- 11 [\cite=Ludlow:2008ty]. This corresponds to a frequency uncertainty of 0.006 MHz for our measurments in 130Te2. The mode number m is determined with a wavelength meter (HighFinesse Å ngstrom WS6 VIS) that was calibrated with light at sufficiently known frequency. n1 and n2 are the sideband diffraction orders from AOM1 and AOM2, while f1 and f2 are the respective operating frequencies. Fig. [\ref=Te_2004_thesis] and Fig. [\ref=Te_2008_2009_thesis] display saturated (top) and linear absorption (bottom) spectra in 130Te2. The repetition rate frep, the offset frequency fCEO and the operation parameters for AOM1 and AOM2 were all kept constant while the IR light frequency was scanned across the transitions. Six of the recorded lines are displayed in Fig. [\ref=Te_Lines_detail_thesis_BS]. The measured saturated absorption lines are fitted with Lorentzian line shapes,

[formula]

where ω0 is the center frequency and Γ is the width of the profile.

Linear absorption of the pump beam was measured by transmitting light through the 130Te2 cell for vapor pressures ranging from 0.2 mbar to 1.6 mbar. Saturated absorption was measured at cell temperature 804(5) K and Te2 vapor pressure ~  1.6 mbar. For all individual saturated absorption lines frequency uncertainties due to the fitting procedure are of order 0.1 MHz. The linewidths of the transitions is between 11 and 29 MHz while the signal strengths varied by a factor 125 in the range from line Te#  0 (Fig. [\ref=Te_2004_thesis]) to line Te#  51 (Fig. [\ref=Te_2004_thesis](Inset)). The frequencies and wavenumbers for the saturated absorption lines are listed in Table [\ref=Frequencies_Strengths_Te].

The pressure shift [\cite=Demtroder:2003] [\cite=Brebrick:1968jk] of similar lines in 130Te2 has been determined previously to be 1 MHz/mbar  [\cite=Barr:1985xy] [\cite=Barwood:1991xy] [\cite=McIntyre:1987jk] [\cite=McIntyre:1990jk]. During the measurements the maximum observed fluctuation of the 130Te2 cell temperature was ±   5 K. This limits the frequency uncertainty due to pressure shifts for the lines measured in 130Te2 to below 0.2 MHz.

The absolute frequency of the 1S0(F = 1/2)-1P1(F' = 3/2) transition in 225Ra is measured with saturated absorption line Te#  51 in 130Te2 as a reference. The transition frequency in Ra is obtained through

[formula]

where ΔfTeRa is the observed frequency difference between the reference line and the 225Ra transition. We find the transition in 225Ra (see Fig. [\ref=Ra_483nm_13Apr2011_thesis_1]) to be centered 418(1) MHz below the reference. This yields an absolute frequency of f225Ra = 621 042 124(2) MHz, respectively 20 715.735 42(6) cm- 1. Together with the isotope shift in this transition of f225Ra -   f226Ra   =   2 236 (15) MHz [\cite=Wendt:1987] and the magnetic dipole interaction constant A(1P1) = 2 796.5(2.5) MHz for 225Ra [\cite=Ahmad:1983jk] we have the transition frequency f226Ra = 621 038 489(15) MHz for this transition in 226Ra (see Table [\ref=Absolute_Frequency_Ra_483nm]). The measurement here was performed with a retroreflected beam (see Fig. [\ref=TeSatAbs_Setup_publication]). The overlap angle of both beams was better than 1 mrad, corresponding to a separation ≤   1 mm of the counter-propagating beams at distance 1 m from the interaction region. The beam alignment was optimized by minimizing the linewidth of the fluorescence signal. This causes residual first-order Doppler shift ΔDoppler ≤   2   MHz for the thermal atomic beam in our experiment.

We exploited an offline atomic beam of 225Ra for Doppler-free laser induced spectroscopy on the 1S0 -   1P1 transition. It is the main transition for efficient slowing of atoms to within the capture range of a magneto optical trap. Our measurement of the transition frequency with uncertainty 2 MHz is an improvement by some two orders of magnitude over a previous measurement for the same transition in 226Ra. This together with the calibration of several lines in Te2 molecules to accuracy MHz provides crucial input for the design of a sensitive search for an EDM in atomic Ra.
