Using 3D Spectroscopy to Probe the Orbital Structure of Composite Bulges

Introduction

Although the standard picture of the stellar structure of disk galaxies combines a disk and a central bulge, recent studies have suggested a dichotomy between galaxies which host classical bulges - round, kinematically hot, and presumed to originate from violent mergers at high redshift - and those with pseudobulges, where the central excess stellar light is from a flattened, kinematically cool structure, presumed to originate from some long-term, internal ("secular") processes.

We have recently found evidence that some disk galaxies can harbor both a classical bulge and a disky pseuduobulge (we use the term "disky pseudobulges" to distinguish them from bar-derived box/peanut structures, which are sometimes also called pseudobulges). Evidence for this includes a combination of highly flattened isophotes, disky substructures (spirals, nuclear rings, nuclear bars), and stellar kinematics dominated by rotation in the disky pseudobulge, and rounder isophotes and stellar kinematics dominated by velocity dispersion in the classical-bulge region; see [\citet=nowak10] and [\citet=erwin14] for details.

As part of our SINFONI Search for Supermassive Black Holes (S3BH), we observed approximately 30 disk and elliptical galaxies with the SINFONI IFU on the VLT, using natural- or laser-guide-star adaptive optics to obtain 3D K-band spectroscopy of the galaxy centers; our sample includes three well-defined examples of composite-bulge galaxies. We combine the high-resolution stellar kinematics derived from this data with larger-scale, ground-based spectroscopy and HST and ground-based imaging to measure SMBH masses via Schwarzschild dynamical modeling [\citep=nowak07] [\citep=nowak08] [\citep=nowak10] [\citep=rusli11] [\citep=rusli13].

As part of the Schwarzschild modeling process, we obtain weighted libraries of stellar orbits for the central galaxy regions; these can be used to explore the relative contributions of ordered (rotational) and random stellar motions within classical and disky pseudobulge regions. Fig. [\ref=fig1] shows part of this analysis, plotting the planar/vertical anisotropy of 3D stellar orbits as a function of radius for an S0 with a purely classical bulge (NGC 1332) and for three composite-bulge galaxies. The anisotropy term measures the relative amounts of "equatorial" dispersion (that is, radial and azimuthal dispersions added in quadrature) versus vertical dispersion (with respect to the equatorial plane). In all four galaxies, the dispersion is approximately isotropic within the classical-bulge region, and shifts to an equatorial-dominant state in the disk outside (for NGC 1332) or in the disky pseudobulge region (for the composite-bulge galaxies). This is additional evidence supporting the argument that what we identify as "classical bulges" in the composite-bulge systems are isotropic, pressure-supported components similar to low-luminosity ellipticals, while the disky pseudobulges have stellar kinematics similar to those of large-scale disks.

Full details of this study are presented in [\citet=erwin14].
