A remark on unique continuation for the Cauchy-Riemann operator

Introduction

The unique continuation property is one of the most interesting properties of holomorphic functions [formula]. This property says that if f vanishes in a non-empty open subset of [formula] then it must be identically zero. Note that [formula] satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equation (i∂y  +  ∂x)u = 0 if and only if it defines a holomorphic function [formula] on [formula]. From this point of view, one can see that a C1 function satisfying the equation has the unique continuation property.

In this note we consider a class of non-holomorphic functions u which satisfy the differential inequality

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Cauchy-Riemann operator and V(x,y) is a function on [formula].

The best positive result for [\eqref=inequality] is due to Wolff [\cite=W] (see Theorem 4 there) who proved the property for V∈Lp with p > 2. On the other hand, there is a counterexample [\cite=M] to unique continuation for [\eqref=inequality] with V∈Lp for p < 2. The remaining case p = 2 seems to be unknown for the differential inequality [\eqref=inequality], and note that L2 is a scale-invariant space of V for the equation [formula]. Here we shall handle this problem. Our unique continuation result is the following theorem which is based on bounds for a Fourier multiplier from Lp to Lq.

Let 1 < p < 2 < q <   ∞   and 1 / p - 1 / q = 1 / 2. Assume that [formula] satisfies the inequality [\eqref=inequality] with V∈L2 and vanishes in a non-empty open subset of [formula]. Then it must be identically zero.

The unique continuation property also holds for harmonic functions, which satisfy the Laplace equation Δu = 0, since they are real parts of holomorphic functions. This was first extended by Carleman  [\cite=C] to a class of non-harmonic functions satisfying the inequality |Δu|  ≤  |Vu| with [formula]. There is an extensive literature on later developments in this subject. In particular, the problem of finding all the possible Lp functions V, for which |Δu|  ≤  |Vu| has the unique continuation, is completely solved (see [\cite=JK] [\cite=KN] [\cite=KT]). See also the survey papers of Kenig [\cite=K] and Wolff [\cite=W2] for more details, and the recent paper of Kenig and Wang [\cite=KW] for a stronger result which gives a quantitative form of the unique continuation.

Throughout the paper, the letter C stands for positive constants possibly different at each occurrence. Also, the notations [formula] and F- 1(f) denote the Fourier and the inverse Fourier transforms of f, respectively.

A preliminary lemma

The standard method to study the unique continuation property is to obtain a suitable Carleman inequality for relevant differential operator. This method originated from Carleman's classical work [\cite=C] for elliptic operators. In our case we need to obtain the following inequality for the Cauchy-Riemann operator [formula], which will be used in the next section for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm]:

Let [formula]. For all t > 0, we have

[formula]

if 1 < p < 2 < q <   ∞   and 1 / p - 1 / q = 1 / 2. Here, [formula] and C is a constant independent of t.

First we note that

[formula]

for [formula]. Then the inequality [\eqref=Sobo] is equivalent to

[formula]

By setting g = z- tf, we are reduced to showing that for [formula]. To show this, let us first set

[formula]

and let [formula] be a smooth function such that ψδ = 0 in the ball B(0,δ) and ψδ = 1 in [formula]. Then, using the Fourier transform in [\eqref=0], we see that Thus, by Fatou's lemma we are finally reduced to showing the following uniform boundedness for a multiplier operator having the multiplier m(ξ,η) = ψδ(ξ,η) / ( - η + iξ):

[formula]

uniformly in δ > 0.

From now on, we will show [\eqref=multi] using Young's inequality for convolutions and Littlewood-Paley theorem ([\cite=G]). Let us first set for [formula]

[formula]

where χk(  ·  ) = χ(2k  ·  ) for [formula] which is such that χ(ξ,η) = 1 if [formula], and zero otherwise. Also, [formula]. Now we claim that

[formula]

uniformly in [formula]. Then, since 1 < p < 2 < q <   ∞  , by the Littlewood-Paley theorem together with Minkowski's inequality, we get the desired inequality [\eqref=multi] as follows:

[formula]

where hk is given by (ξ,η) = χk(ξ,η)(ξ,η). Now it remains to show the claim [\eqref=multi2]. But, this follows easily from Young's inequality. Indeed, note that

[formula]

and by Plancherel's theorem

[formula]

Since we are assuming the gap condition 1 / p - 1 / q = 1 / 2, by Young's inequality for convolutions, this readily implies that

[formula]

as desired.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm]

The proof is standard once one has the Carleman inequality [\eqref=Sobo] in Lemma [\ref=lem].

Without loss of generality, we may show that u must vanish identically if it vanishes in a sufficiently small neighborhood of zero. Then, since we are assuming that [formula] vanishes near zero, from [\eqref=Sobo] with a standard limiting argument involving a C∞0 approximate identity, it follows that Thus by [\eqref=inequality] we see that

[formula]

where B(0,r) is the ball of radius r > 0 centered at 0. Then, using Hölder's inequality with 1 / p - 1 / q = 1 / 2, the first term on the right-hand side in the above can be absorbed into the left-hand side as follows:

[formula]

if we choose r small enough. Here, [formula] is finite since u∈Lq vanishes near zero. Hence we get

[formula]

By letting t  →    ∞  , we now conclude that u = 0 on B(0,r). This implies [formula] by a standard connectedness argument.
