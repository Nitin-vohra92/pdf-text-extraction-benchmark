Lemma

On the Diophantine equation X2N  +  22α52βp2γ  =  Z5

Introduction

In 2001, Arif and Abu Muriefah [\cite=ArMu01] (and in 2002, independently, Le [\cite=Le02]) proved that there is no integer solution to the equation x2  +  22m  =  yn, with m  ≥  3, n  ≥  3, and gcd (x,y)  =  1. Since that time, there has been great interest in studying many variations of this equation. Of particular interest here are those in which the 22m is replaced by a power of a different prime or with the product of a small number of primes raised to powers. We consider an equation of the latter form, in which we also replace the variable exponent in the final term with the constant 5 and allow for any even exponent greater than 2 on the first term. Our equation is actually inspired by the work of Bennett [\cite=Be06] in which he considers the equation x2n  +  y2n  =  z5, with n  >  1. We do not require that the middle term be raised to the power 2n, only that it be an even square with few prime factors.

Let p be an odd prime, α a positive integer, and β and γ non-negative integers. The equation

[formula]

has no solution with X, Z, [formula], N  >  1, and gcd (X,Z)  =  1.

Note that the condition N  >  1 is necessary for the theorem to hold, since, for example, 412  +  22  ·  192  =  55.

A number of special cases of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] are already known. For N  =  2, Bruin [\cite=Br03] proved that equation ([\ref=maineq]) has no positive integer solutions and for N  =  3, Bennett and Chen [\cite=BeCh12] proved likewise. The theorem is also known to be true for β  =  γ  =  0 [\cite=ArMu01] [\cite=Le02], β  ≠  0 and γ  =  0 [\cite=LuTo08], p  =  3 and β  =  0 [\cite=Lu02], p  =  11 and β  =  0 [\cite=CaDe10], p  =  13 [\cite=GoLuTo08], p  =  17 [\cite=GoMaTo12], p  =  19 and β  =  0 [\cite=SoUlZh12], 22α52βp2γ  ≤  100 (see, for example, [\cite=BuMiSi06]), and N divisible by a prime greater than 17 that is congruent to 1 modulo 4 [\cite=Ch10].

We note further that, since equation ([\ref=maineq]) is of the form X2N  +  C2  =  Z5, a result of Darmon and Granville [\cite=DaGr95] guarantees that, for any given value of N, there are at most finitely many integer solutions with gcd (X,Z)  =  1.

In the following section, we first present and prove a lemma important to the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]. We then state a simplified version of a result due to Bennett and Skinner [\cite=BeSk04], specific to our needs. In Section [\ref=proof], we prove Theorem [\ref=mainthm], following the ideas and methods found in [\cite=Be06].

Preliminaries

We begin with two lemmas.

Let p, α, β, and γ be as in Theorem [\ref=mainthm], with p  ≠  5. Let u and [formula] be coprime, with v even, such that

[formula]

Then v4  -  10u2v2  +  5u4  ≠  5.

Suppose that v4  -  10u2v2  +  5u4  =  5. Then, by equation ([\ref=lv()]),

[formula]

and β  ≥  2. Combining the two equations, we find that 5(u2  -  v2)2  -  5  =  4v4  =  24α  +  254β  -  4p4γ, and so (u2  -  v2  +  1)(u2  -  v2  -  1)  =  24α  +  254β  -  5p4γ. Since gcd (u2  -  v2  +  1,u2  -  v2  -  1)  =  2 and [formula],

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Subtracting, then dividing by 2, we obtain

[formula]

Now, [formula] and, since p  ≠  5, [formula]. Hence, equation ([\ref=lk]) implies that k  =  0. It follows that [formula] and so we have p4γ  -  24α54β  -  5  =  1 with γ  ≠  0. If p  ≠  3, then reducing modulo 3 yields a contradiction. Thus p  =  3 and

[formula]

But this provides a positive integer solution to the equation X2  +  2a  ·  5b  =  YN with gcd (X,Y)  =  1, 4|N, a  >  0, and b  ≥  3, contradicting [\cite=LuTo08].

Therefore, v4  -  10u2v2  +  5u4  ≠  5.

Following a "modular approach" to solving Diophantine equations, Bennett and Skinner [\cite=BeSk04] developed the main tools we use in proving Theorem [\ref=mainthm]. We give here a corollary of a particular case of one of their results, based on the presentation given in [\cite=CohenII]. As usual, for [formula], let vp(a) denote the p-valuation of a.

Let x7  +  Cy7  =  z2 with C, x, y, [formula], xy  ≠    ±  1, x, Cy, and z nonzero and pairwise relatively prime, [formula], v2(Cy7)  ≥  6, and for all primes q, vq(C)  <  7. Then there exists a newform of level

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]

Let p, α, β, and γ be as in Theorem [\ref=mainthm] and suppose that (N,X,Z)  =  (n,x,z) is a solution to equation ([\ref=maineq]) with n, x, [formula], n  >  1, and gcd (x,z)  =  1. Note that, since α  ≥  1, x and z are both odd.

We assume without loss of generality that p  ≠  5 and that n is prime. As noted in the introduction, by [\cite=Br03], n  ≠  2, and by [\cite=BeCh12], n  ≠  3.

Suppose that n  =  5. By equation ([\ref=maineq]),

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Since x and z are odd, z  -  x2 is even. Note that, since x  ≥  1 and α  ≥  1, x10  +  22α52βp2γ  ≥  5, which implies that z  >  1, and, therefore, z4  +  z3x2  +  z2x4  +  zx6  +  x8  ≠  1 or 5.

If β  =  0, then gcd (z  -  x2,z4  +  z3x2  +  z2x4  +  zx6  +  x8)  =  1 and so

If β  ≠  0, then, noting that [formula], we have 5|(z  -  x2). So [formula] and gcd (z  -  x2,z4  +  z3x2  +  z2x4  +  zx6  +  x8)  =  5. Hence, from equation ([\ref=n=5]),

Thus, in either case, we have z  =  x2  +  22α5j, with j  ≥  0. So equation ([\ref=n=5main]) becomes 22α52βp2γ  =  (x2  +  22α5j)5  -  x10. Expanding and removing a factor of 22α, we have

[formula]

If β  =  0, then j  =  0 and reducing equation ([\ref=split]) modulo 8 yields [formula], a contradiction. If β  ≠  0, then j  =  2β  -  1 and reducing equation ([\ref=split]) modulo 3 yields [formula], another contradiction. Hence, n  ≠  5.

So n  ≥  7.

Writing equation ([\ref=maineq]) in the form [formula], a classical argument (see, for example, [\cite=CohenII]) yields nonzero coprime integers, u and v, of opposite parity, such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since x is odd, equation ([\ref=u()]) implies that u is odd. Since u and v are of opposite parity, v is even.

Further, since gcd (u,v)  =  1,

If 5|v, then [formula] and so [formula]. Thus, since gcd (v,v4  -  10u2v2  +  5u4)  =  5, by equation ([\ref=v()]), v4  -  10u2v2  +  5u4  =  5 or ±  5pγ. By Lemma [\ref=5], the first is impossible. Therefore, we have

[formula]

with γ  ≠  0.

If [formula], then, by equation ([\ref=v()]), β  =  0. Since gcd (v,v4  -  10u2v2  +  5u4)  =  1, v4  -  10u2v2  +  5u4  =    ±  1 or ±  pγ. But [formula], since v is even. Hence, in this case,

[formula]

Combining equations ([\ref=5midv]) and ([\ref=5nmidv]), we have

[formula]

where k  =  β  -  1 if 5|v, and k  =  0 otherwise.

Now, if 5|u, then [formula] and we have gcd (u,u4  -  10u2v2  +  5v4)  =  5. Since [formula] and n is odd, by equation ([\ref=u()]), there exist nonzero coprime integers A1, [formula] such that

[formula]

Thus, [formula]. Recalling that [formula], we can combine this with equation ([\ref=5nmidv]), letting [formula], to obtain

[formula]

Reducing the second part of ([\ref=5u^4]) modulo 8, we find that [formula], and hence B1 is odd and not equal to ±  1. By [\cite=BeSk04], there is no integer solution to the equation Xn  +  24α  +  2Yn  =  5Z2, satisfying these conditions. Thus, we have a contradiction.

On the other hand, if [formula], then gcd (u,u4  -  10u2v2  +  5v4)  =  1. This together with equation ([\ref=u()]) and the fact that n is odd implies that there exist nonzero coprime integers A2, [formula] such that

[formula]

Thus, [formula]. Combining this with equation ([\ref=v]) and letting w2  =  u2  -  5v2 yields

[formula]

By equation ([\ref=u^4]), since u is not divisible by 2 or 5, neither is B2. So gcd (B2,w2)  =  1. By [\cite=BeSk04], there is no integer solution to the equation Xn  +  24α + 254k + 1Yn  =  Z2, satisfying these conditions, with prime n  ≥  11. Hence, we have a contradiction unless n  =  7.

For the case n  =  7 (still assuming that [formula]), we first note that 4α  +  2  ≥  6, [formula], and, since gcd (u,v)  =  1, [formula]. Evaluating equation ([\ref=5w_2]) modulo 3, recalling that n  =  7, yields [formula], implying that [formula]. On the other hand, evaluating equation ([\ref=5w_2]) modulo 8 yields [formula]. Thus B2  ≠    ±  1.

Rewriting equation ([\ref=5w_2]) in the form

[formula]

with ri, [formula] such that 0  ≤  ri  <  7, for i∈{1,2}, we can apply Lemma [\ref=BeSk] (with C  =  2r15r2). Hence, there exists a newform of level N7, where N7∈{1,2,5,10}. But, as is well-known (see, for example, [\cite=CohenII]), there are no newforms of any of these levels. Therefore n  ≠  7, yielding another contradiction.

Hence the initial supposition is false, and the theorem is proved.
