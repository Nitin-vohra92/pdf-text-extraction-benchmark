Introduction

We study the infinite graph whose vertices correspond to points in d-dimensional Euclidean space and where two vertices p,q are considered adjacent p  ~  q if d(p,q)  =  1. We denote this graph by [formula].

Recall that the chromatic number χ(G) of a graph G is the smallest number of colors needed for a proper coloring, i.e. the smallest k so that there exists a function [formula] such that whenever p  ~  q, we have f(p)  ≠  f(q).

Determining the chromatic number of the plane [formula] is a well known problem in combinatorics. For several decades the bounds have held fast at

[formula]

See Soifer's "The mathematical coloring book" [\cite=Soifer] for an encyclopedic overview of this problem and its history.

The problem has also been studied in higher dimensions. See [\cite=Soifer] and Kupavskii-Raigorodskii's paper [\cite=KR09]. With the aid of extensive calculations in the free and open-source software Sage [\cite=sage], we obtain new lower bounds for [formula] in dimensions [formula]. We verified all of the computations in Maple 17.

Our main result is the following.

We have that [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]

As far as we are aware, the best previously published lower bounds were, respectively:

[formula] by Larman and Rogers in 1972 [\cite=LR72], and [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] by Kupavskii and Raigorodskii in 2009 [\cite=KR09].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We prove the bounds [formula], [formula], and [formula] in Section [\ref=sec:hcube]; the bound [formula] in Section [\ref=sec:hsec]; and the bound [formula] in Section [\ref=sec:E8].

Hypercube graphs

Graphs constructed on vertices of the d-dimensional cube {0,1}d provide important examples in geometric graph theory. Frankl and Wilson's proof that

[formula]

for some constant C > 0, for example, uses such graphs [\cite=FW81]. See also Kahn and Kalai's subsequent counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture [\cite=KK93].

Define the hypercube graph C(d,u) to have vertices V = {0,1}d, with two vertices adjacent if their Hamming distance is u. Note that Hamming distance u corresponds to Euclidean distance [formula]. So by dilating Euclidean space by a factor of [formula], we see that C(d,u) is a unit-distance graph in [formula].

For d odd C(d,u) is bipartite, so for our purposes these are not very interesting. For d even C(d,u) has two isomorphic connected components -- we denote one of these "half-cube" connected components on 2d - 1 vertices by H(d,u). In general we have that

[formula]

For example C(5,2) is a graph on 32 vertices, regular of degree 10, and the half-cube H(5,2) is a graph on 16 vertices.

Recall that for a graph G with |V(G)| vertices and independence number α(G), we have that

[formula]

One checks that the independence number α(H(5,2))  =  2. Then the independence-number bound gives that χ(H)  ≥  8, and since H is a unit-distance graph in [formula], this also gives that [formula]. This half-cube example is well known; see for example [\cite=LR72].

In Figure [\ref=fig:asy] we summarize our results on chromatic numbers of hypercube graphs for small d and u. In some cases we were able to compute χ(C(d,u)) exactly. In some other cases we were not, but we were still able to compute the independence number α(C(d,u)), giving a lower bound.

We obtain new lower bounds on [formula] for d  =  10 and d = 11 this way, in both cases with Hamming distance u = 4. According to a calculation in Sage, the halfcube H(10,4) has independence number α(H(10,4))  =  20. There are 512 vertices, so then

[formula]

and since the chromatic number is an integer,

[formula]

According to another calculation in Sage, the half-cube H(11,4) has independence number α(H(10,4))  =  32. There are 1024 vertices, and then we have

[formula]

This last example also gives a new record lower bound [formula].

Since Hamming distance 4 corresponds to Euclidean distance 2, these graphs still have rational coordinates when rescaled to unit-distance graphs.

Hyperplane slices of hypercube graphs

Let C(d,u,s) denote the intersection of C(d,u) with the hyperplane at height s

[formula]

Clearly, C(d,u,s) is a unit distance graph in Rd - 1, so

[formula]

For example, C(10,4) has 210 = 1024 vertices and is regular of degree [formula], where the subgraph C(10,4,5) has [formula] vertices and is regular of degree 100.

We found with a computation in Sage that

[formula]

so

[formula]

This gives an alternate proof for the currently best known bound of Kupavskii and Raigorodskii [\cite=KR09].

A unit-distance graph in [formula]

Let G0 be a graph whose vertices are the 240 shortest vectors in the E8 lattice. These may also be described as the vertices of an 8-dimensional Gosset polytope.

Concretely, there are 112 vertices with integer entries obtained from arbitrary permutations of the vectors

[formula]

and 128 vertices with integer entries obtained from all vectors

[formula]

with an even number of minus signs.

Adjacency is with respect to Euclidean distance 4. So for example, (2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0) is adjacent to (0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0).

The graph G0 lives on a 7-dimensional sphere of radius [formula]. A pair of vertices on this sphere is adjacent if and only if the corresponding vectors are orthogonal.

Now define P to be the set of integer points within distance 4 of the origin.

Our algorithm is as follows.

Initialize G0 as above.

Choose a vertex x∈P outside of the current graph Gi.

If the independence number remains unchanged on adding vertex x to the graph Gi then add X, i.e. if α(Gi  +  x)  =  α(Gi), then set V(Gi + 1): = V(Gi)  +  x.

If there are any more points in P outside of the graph V(Gi) , go to step (2).

After experimentation, we found that at least 49 points (Figure [\ref=fig:add]) could be added without increasing the independence number, which then gives a unit-distance graph G with

[formula]

so [formula]. Our graph G can be rescaled to have rational coordinates and unit distance, so this also gives the new lower bound [formula].

Mann used extensive computer-aided calculations to hunt for unit-distance graphs with large chromatic number in 2003 [\cite=M03] -- he established the lower bounds [formula], [formula], and [formula].

Cibulka studied similar constructions in [\cite=Cibulka08]. He also added points to Gosset polytopes one at a time, and used computer-aided calculations to establish the bounds [formula] and [formula].

Unit-distance graphs built on Gosset polytopes go back at least to the landmark paper of Larman and Rogers in 1972 [\cite=LR72]. They in turn thanked McMullen for suggesting the idea. Larman and Rogers exhibited a configuration of 64 points, a "spindle" over the 7-dimensional Gosset polytope, to establish the previous record lower bound
