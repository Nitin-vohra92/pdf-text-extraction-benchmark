Introduction

Triangulated categories were introduced independently in algebraic geometry by Verdier in his thése [\cite=Ve77], and in algebraic topology by Puppe [\cite=Pu62] in the early sixies, which have by now become indispensable in many areas of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, stable homotopy theory and representation theory [\cite=BBD82] [\cite=Ha88] [\cite=Ma83]. The basic properties of triangulated categories can be found in Neeman's book [\cite=Ne01].

Let C be a triangulated category with triangles Δ. Beligiannis [\cite=Be00] developed homological algebra in C which parallels the homological algebra in an exact category in the sense of Quillen. By specifying a class of triangles ξ  ⊆  Δ, which is called a proper class of triangles, he introduced ξ-projective objects, ξ-projective dimensions and their duals.

Auslander and Bridger generalized in [\cite=AB69] finitely generated projective modules to finitely generated modules of Gorenstein dimension zero over commutative noetherian rings. Furthermore, Enochs and Jenda introduced in [\cite=EJ95] Gorenstein projective modules for arbitrary modules over a general ring, which is a generalization of finitely generated modules of Gorenstein dimension zero, and dually they defined Gorenstein injective modules. Gorenstein homological algebra has been extensively studied by many authors, see for example [\cite=AM02] [\cite=Ch00] [\cite=EJ00] [\cite=Ho04].

As a natural generalization of modules of Gorenstein dimension zero, Beligiannis [\cite=Bel00] defined the concept of an X-Gorenstein object in an additive category C for a contravariantly finite subcategory X of C such that any X-epic has kernal in C. In an attempt to extend the theory, Asadollahi and Salarian [\cite=AS04] introduced and studied ξ-Gorenstein projective and ξ-Gorenstein injective objects, and then ξ-Gorenstein projective and ξ-Gorenstein injective dimensions of objects in a triangulated category which are defined by modifying what Enochs and Jenda have done in an abelian category [\cite=EJ00].

Let A be an abelian category and X an additive full subcategory of A. Sather-Wagstaff, Sharif and White introduced in [\cite=SSW08] the Gorenstein category G(X), which is defined as [formula]. Set G0(X) = X, G1(X) = G(X), and inductively set Gn + 1(X) = Gn(G(X)) for any [formula]. They proved that when X is self-orthogonal, Gn(X) = G(X) for any [formula]; and they proposed the question whether G2(X) = G(X) holds for an arbitrary subcategory X. See [\cite=SSW08]. Recently, Huang [\cite=Hu13] proved that the answer to this question is affirmative. This shows that G(X), in particular the subcategory (A) of all Gorenstein projective objects, has a strong stability. Kong and Zhang give a slight generalization of this stability by a different method [\cite=KZ14].

Inspired by the above results, we consider the stability of the subcategory (ξ) of all ξ-Gorenstein projective objects, which is introduced by Asadollahi and Salarian [\cite=AS04]. Set G0P(ξ) = P(ξ), G1P(ξ) = (ξ), and inductively set Gn + 1P(ξ) = Gn((ξ)) for any [formula]. A natural question is whether GnP(ξ)  =  (ξ).

In Section 2, we give some terminologies and some preliminary results. Section 3 is devoted to answer the above question. We will prove the following theorem.

Main theorem Let C be a triangulated category with enough ξ-projectives, where ξ is a proper class of triangles. Then GnP(ξ) = (ξ) for any n  ≥  1.

The above theorem shows that the subcategory (ξ) of all ξ-Gorenstein projective objects has a strong stability. That is, an iteration of the procedure used to define the ξ-Gorenstein projective objects yields exactly the ξ-Gorenstein projective objects. Finally, we give some equivalent characterizations for ξ-Gorenstein projective dimension of an object A in C.

Some basic facts in triangulated categories

This section is devoted to recall the definitions and elementary properties of triangulated categories used throughout the paper. For the terminology we shall follow [\cite=AS04] [\cite=AS06] [\cite=Be00].

Let C be an additive category and Σ:C  →  C be an additive functor. Let (C,Σ) denote the category whose objects are diagrams in C of the form A  →  B  →  C  →  ΣA, and morphisms between two objects Ai  →  Bi  →  Ci  →  ΣAi, i = 1,2, are a triple of morphisms α:A1  →  A2, β:B1  →  B2 and γ:C1  →  C2, such that the following diagram commutes:

[formula]

A triangulated category is a triple (C,Σ,Δ), where C is an additive category, Σ is an autoequivalence of C and Δ is a full subcategory of (C,Σ) which satisfies the following axioms. The elements of Δ are then called triangles.

(Tr1) Every diagram isomorphic to a triangle is a triangle. Every morphism f:A  →  B in C can be embedded into a triangle [formula]. For any object A∈C, the diagram [formula] is a triangle, where 1A denotes the identity morphism from A to A.

(Tr2) [formula] is a triangle if and only if [formula].

(Tr3) Given triangles [formula], i = 1,2, and morphism α:A1  →  A2, β:B1  →  B2 such that f2α  =  βf1, there exists a morphism γ:C1  →  C2 such that (α,β,γ) is a morphism from the first triangle to the second.

(Tr4) (The Octahedral Axiom) Given triangles

[formula]

there exist morphisms f':C'  →  B' and g':B'  →  A' such that the following diagram commutes and the third column is a triangle:

[formula]

Some equivalent formulations for the Octahedral Axiom [formula] are given in [\cite=Be00], which are more convient to use. If C = (C,Σ,Δ) satisfies all the axioms of a triangulated category except possible of [formula], then [formula] is equivalent to each of the following:

[formula]: For any triangle [formula] and morphism ε:E  →  C, there exists a commutative diagram:

[formula]

in which all horizontal and vertical diagrams are triangles in Δ.

[formula]: For any triangle [formula] and morphism α:A  →  D, there exists a commutative diagram:

[formula]

in which all horizontal and vertical diagrams are triangles in Δ.

The following definitions are quoted verbatim from [\cite=Be00]. A class of triangles ξ is closed under base change if for any triangle [formula] and any morphism ε:E  →  C as in the base change diagram above, the triangle [formula] belongs to ξ. Dually, a class of triangles ξ is closed under cobase change if for any triangle [formula] and any morphism α:A  →  D as in the cobase change diagram above, the triangle [formula] belongs to ξ. A class of triangles ξ is closed under suspension if for any triangle [formula] and [formula], the triangle [formula] is in ξ. A class of triangles ξ is called saturated if in the situation of base change, whenever the third vertical and the second horizontal triangles are in ξ, then the triangle [formula] is in ξ. An easy consequence of the octahedral axiom is that ξ is saturated if and only if in the situation of cobase change, whenever the second vertical and the third horizontal triangles are in ξ, then the triangle [formula] is in ξ.

A triangle [formula] is called split if it is isomorphic to the triangle [formula]. It is easy to see that (T) is split if and only if f is a section or g is a retraction or h = 0. The full subcategory of Δ consisting of the split triangles will be denoted by Δ0.

([\cite=Be00]) Let C = (C,Σ,Δ) be a triangulated category. A class ξ  ⊆  Δ is called a proper class of triangles if the following conditions hold.

(1) ξ is closed under isomorphisms, finite coproducts and Δ0  ⊆  ξ  ⊆  Δ.

(2) ξ is closed under suspensions and is saturated.

(3) ξ is closed under base and cobase change.

It is known that Δ0 and the class of all triangles Δ in C are proper classes of triangles. There are more interesting examples of proper classes of triangles enumerated in [\cite=Be00].

Throughout we fix a proper class ξ of triangles in the triangulated category C.

([\cite=Be00]) An object P∈C (resp., I∈C) is called ξ-projective (resp., ξ-injective) if for any triangle A  →  B  →  C  →  ΣA in ξ, the induced sequence of abelian groups [formula] (resp., [formula]) is exact.

It follows easily from the definition that the subcategory P(ξ) of ξ-projective objects and the subcategory I(ξ) of ξ-injective objects are full, additive, Σ-stable, and closed under isomorphisms and direct summands. The category C is said to have enough ξ-projectives (resp., ξ-injectives) if for any object A∈C, there exists a triangle K  →  P  →  A  →  ΣK (resp., A  →  I  →  L  →  ΣA) in ξ with P∈P(ξ) (resp., I∈I(ξ)). However, it is not so easy to find a proper class ξ of triangles in a triangulated category having enough ξ-projectives or ξ-injectives in general. Here we present a nontrivial example due to Beligiannis, and also, see more nontrivial examples in [\cite=Be00], which are of great interest. Take C to be the unbounded homotopy category of complexes of objects from a Grothendieck category which has enough projectives. Then the so-called Cartan-Eilenberg projective and injective complexes form the relative projective and injective objects for a proper class of triangles in C.

The following lemma is quoted from [\cite=Be00].

Let C have enough ξ-projectives. Then a triangle A  →  B  →  C  →  ΣA is in ξ if and only if for all P∈P(ξ) the induced sequence [formula] is exact.

Recall that an ξ-exact sequence X is a diagram

[formula]

in C, such that for each [formula], there exists triangle [formula] in ξ and the differential is defined as dn = fn - 1gn for any n.

Let X be a full and additive subcategory of C. A triangle A  →  B  →  C  →  ΣA in ξ is called C( - ,X)-exact (resp., C(X, - )-exact), if for any X∈X, the induced sequence of abelian groups [formula] (resp., [formula]) is exact.

A complete ξ-projective resolution is a diagram

[formula]

in C such that for any integer n, Pn∈P(ξ) and there exist C( - ,P(ξ))-exact triangles

[formula]

in ξ and the differential is defined as dn = fn - 1gn for any n.

(see [\cite=AS04]) Let [formula] be a complete ξ-projective resolution in C. So for any integer n, there exist triangles

[formula]

in ξ. The objects Kn for any integer n, are called ξ-Gorenstein projective (ξ-Gprojective for short).

Dually, one can define complete ξ-injective resolution and ξ-Gorenstein injective (ξ-Ginjective for short) objects.

We denote by (ξ) and (ξ) the subcategory of ξ-Gprojective and ξ-Ginjective objects of C respectively. It is obvious that P(ξ)  ⊆  (ξ) and I(ξ)  ⊆  (ξ); (ξ) and (ξ) are full, additive, Σ-stable, and closed under isomorphisms and direct summands.

Main results

Throughout the paper, C is a triangulated category with enough ξ-projectives and enough ξ-injectives, where ξ is a fixed proper class of triangles.

Recall that in [\cite=AS04] a diagram

[formula]

in C is a complete ξ-projective resolution, if for any n, Pn∈P(ξ), and there exist C( - ,P(ξ))-exact triangles

[formula]

in ξ and the differential is defined as dn = fn - 1gn for any n. That is, [formula] is an ξ-exact sequence of ξ-projective objects, and is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact. The objects Kn for any integer n, are called ξ-Gorenstein projective (ξ-Gprojective for short). Dually, one can define complete ξ-injective resolution and ξ-Gorenstein injective (ξ-Ginjective for short) objects.

We study only the case of ξ-Gprojective objects since the study of the ξ-Ginjective objects is dual.

An ξ-Gprojective resolution of A∈C is an ξ-exact sequence [formula] in C, such that Gn∈(ξ) for all n  ≥  0. The definition is different from [\cite=AS04].

Let C be a triangulated category with enough ξ-projectives, A∈C. Then A has an ξ-projective resolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact if and only if A has an ξ-Gprojective resolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact.

Proof Since P(ξ)  ⊆  (ξ), it is enough to show the "if" part. Assume that A has an ξ-Gprojective resolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact. Then there exists a triangle δ:B  →  G0  →  A  →  ΣB∈ξ which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact, where G0∈(ξ) and B has an ξ-Gprojective resolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact. Since G0∈(ξ), there exists a triangle η:G0'  →  P0  →  G0  →  ΣG0'∈ξ such that G0'∈(ξ), P0∈P(ξ) and it is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact. By base change, we have the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

Since ξ is closed under base change, we have η'∈ξ. Applying the functor C(P(ξ), - ) to the above diagram, we obtain the following commutative diagram

[formula]

By snake lemma, we get that the second vertical sequence is exact, and so L  →  P0  →  A  →  ΣL∈ξ by Lemma [\ref=lem1]. For any Q∈P(ξ), applying C( - ,Q) to the above base change diagram, we obtain the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

By snake lemma, one can get that C(δ',Q) and C(η',Q) are exact. Since B has an ξ-Gprojective resolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact, there exists a triangle C  →  G1  →  B  →  ΣC∈ξ which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact, where G1∈(ξ) and C has an ξ-Gprojective resolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact. By base change and the similar method above, we have the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

such that ε' and ζ' are in ξ. Since G0'∈(ξ) and G1∈(ξ), by [\cite=AS04], we have M∈(ξ). Thus L has an ξ-Gprojective resolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact. Note that the triangle L  →  P0  →  A  →  ΣL is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact. By repeating the preceding process, we have that A has an ξ-projective resolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact, as required. [formula]

An ξ-projective (ξ-Gprojective) coresolution of A∈C is an ξ-exact sequence [formula] in C, such that Xn∈P(ξ) (Xn∈(ξ)) for all n  ≥  0.

Let C be a triangulated category with enough ξ-projectives, A∈C. Then A has an ξ-projective coresolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact if and only if A has an ξ-Gprojective coresolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact.

Proof It is completely dual to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem4]. So we omit it.[formula]

Let C be a triangulated category with enough ξ-projectives, A∈C. Then the following statements are equivalent:

(1) A is an ξ-Gprojective object.

(2) A has an ξ-projective resolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact and has an ξ-projective coresolution which is C( - ,P(ξ))-exact.

(3) There exist C( - ,P(ξ))-exact triangles Kn + 1  →  Pn  →  Kn  →  ΣKn + 1∈ξ such that Pn∈P(ξ) and K0 = A.

Proof It follows from the definition of ξ-Gprojective object. [formula]

Let C be a triangulated category with enough ξ-projectives, A∈C. The following are equivalent:

(1) A is ξ-Gprojective.

(2) There exist C( - ,(ξ))-exact and C((ξ), - )-exact triangles Kn + 1  →  Gn  →  Kn  →  ΣKn + 1∈ξ such that Gn∈(ξ) and K0 = A.

(3) There exist C( - ,(ξ))-exact triangles Kn + 1  →  Gn  →  Kn  →  ΣKn + 1∈ξ such that Gn∈(ξ) and K0 = A.

(4) There exist C( - ,P(ξ))-exact triangles Kn + 1  →  Gn  →  Kn  →  ΣKn + 1∈ξ such that Gn∈(ξ) and K0 = A.

(5) There exists a C((ξ), - )-exact and C( - ,(ξ))-exact triangle A  →  G  →  A  →  ΣA∈ξ such that G∈(ξ).

(6) There exists a C( - ,(ξ))-exact triangle A  →  G  →  A  →  ΣA∈ξ such that G∈(ξ).

(7) There exists a C( - ,P(ξ))-exact triangle A  →  G  →  A  →  ΣA∈ξ such that G∈(ξ).

Proof

(1)⇒  (2) Let A be an ξ-Gprojective object of C. Consider the triangles

[formula] and [formula]

Since ξ is proper, it contains Δ0. So the above two triangles are in ξ. It is easy to see that they are C( - ,(ξ))-exact and C((ξ), - )-exact triangles.

(2)⇒  (3) and (3)⇒  (4) are clear.

(4)⇒  (1) It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem4] and Lemma [\ref=lem5].

(1)⇒  (5) Let A be an ξ-Gprojective object of C. Consider the split triangle

[formula]

Since ξ is proper, it contains Δ0. So δ is in ξ. For any Q∈(ξ), applying the functors C(Q, - ) and C( - ,Q) to the above triangle, we get the following exact sequences

[formula]

[formula]

By [\cite=AS04], we can obtain [formula]. So we are done.

(5)⇒  (6)⇒  (7)⇒  (1) are clear.[formula]

Denote by (ξ) the subcategory of all ξ-Gprojective objects. Set G0P(ξ) = P(ξ), G1P(ξ) = (ξ), and inductively set Gn + 1P(ξ) = Gn((ξ)) for any [formula]. Now we can obtain our main theorem.

Let C be a triangulated category with enough ξ-projectives. Then GnP(ξ) = (ξ) for any n  ≥  1.

Proof It is easy to see that [formula] is an ascending chain of subcategories of C. By (1)  ⇔  (3) of the above theorem, we have that G2P(ξ) = (ξ). By using induction on n we get easily the assertion. [formula]

In order to give some equivalent characterizations for ξ-Gorenstein projective dimension of an object A in C, one needs the following lemma.

Let 0  →  B  →  G1  →  G0  →  A  →  0 be an ξ-exact sequence with G1,G0∈(ξ). Then there exist the following ξ-exact sequences:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where P,Q∈P(ξ) and G0',G1'∈(ξ).

Proof Since G1 is in (ξ), there exists a triangle G1  →  P  →  G2  →  ΣG1∈ξ with P ξ-projective and G2 ξ-Gprojective. Since 0  →  B  →  G1  →  G0  →  A  →  0 is an ξ-exact sequence, there exist triangles B  →  G1  →  K  →  ΣB∈ξ and K  →  G0  →  A  →  ΣK∈ξ. Then we have the following commutative diagrams by cobase change.

[formula]

[formula]

Since ξ is closed under cobase change, we get K  →  C  →  G2  →  ΣK∈ξ and C  →  G0'  →  A  →  ΣC∈ξ.

For any Q∈P(ξ), applying the functor C(Q, - ) to the above diagrams, we have the following commutative diagrams:

[formula]

[formula]

By snake lemma and Lemma [\ref=lem1], we have B  →  P  →  C  →  ΣB∈ξ and G0  →  G0'  →  G2  →  ΣG0∈ξ. Because both G0 and G2 are in (ξ), G0' is also in (ξ) by [\cite=AS04]. Connecting the triangles B  →  P  →  C  →  ΣB and C  →  G0'  →  A  →  ΣC, we get the first desired ξ-exact sequence.

Since G0 is ξ-Gprojective, there is a triangle G3  →  Q  →  G0  →  ΣG3∈ξ with Q∈P(ξ) and G3∈(ξ). Then we have the following two commutative diagrams by base change:

[formula]

[formula]

Since ξ is closed under base change, we get that the triangles G3  →  W  →  K  →  ΣG3 and B  →  G1'  →  W  →  ΣB are in ξ. Applying the functor C(P(ξ), - ) to the above two diagrams, by snake lemma and Lemma [\ref=lem1] we have that the triangles W  →  Q  →  A  →  ΣW and G3  →  G1'  →  G1  →  ΣG3 are in ξ. Because both G1 and G3 are in (ξ), G1' is also in (ξ) by [\cite=AS04]. Connecting the triangles B  →  G1'  →  W  →  ΣB and W  →  Q  →  A  →  ΣW, we get the second desired ξ-exact sequence. [formula]

In particular, we have the following corollary.

Let G1  →  G0  →  A  →  ΣG1 be in ξ with G1,G0∈(ξ). Then there exist the following triangles:

[formula]

and

[formula]

in ξ where P,Q∈P(ξ) and G0',G1'∈(ξ).

Let C be a triangulated category with enough ξ-projectives, A∈C, and n be a non-negative integer. Then the following statements are equivalent:

(1) ξ-(A)  ≤  n.

(2) For every 0  ≤  i  ≤  n, there is an ξ-exact sequence

[formula]

with Pj∈P(ξ) for all 0  ≤  j  ≤  n, j  ≠  i, and G∈(ξ).

(3) For every 0  ≤  i  ≤  n, there is an ξ-exact sequence

[formula]

with Gj∈(ξ) for all 0  ≤  j  ≤  n, j  ≠  i, and P∈P(ξ).

Proof The case n = 0 is trivial. We may assume n  ≥  1.

(1)⇒  (2) we proceed by induction on n. Suppose ξ-(A)  ≤  1. Then there exists a triangle G1  →  G0  →  A  →  ΣG1 in ξ with G0,G1∈(ξ). By Corollary [\ref=cor1], we get the triangles P  →  G0'  →  A  →  ΣP and G1'  →  Q  →  A  →  ΣG1' in ξ with P,Q∈(ξ) and G0',G1'∈(ξ).

Now suppose n  ≥  2. Then there exists an ξ-exact sequence

[formula]

with Gi∈(ξ) for all 0  ≤  i  ≤  n. Applying Proposition [\ref=prop1] to the relevant ξ-exact sequence 0  →  K  →  G1  →  G0  →  A  →  0, we get an ξ-exact sequence 0  →  K  →  G1'  →  P0  →  A  →  0 with G1'∈(ξ) and P0∈P(ξ), which yields an ξ-exact sequence

[formula]

Taking into account the relevant ξ-exact sequence

[formula]

it follows that ξ-(L)  ≤  n - 1. By the induction hypothesis, there exists an ξ-exact sequence

[formula]

with Pj∈P(ξ) for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, j  ≠  i, and G∈(ξ). Now one can paste the above ξ-exact sequence and the triangle L  →  P0  →  A  →  ΣL together to obtain the desired ξ-exact sequence.

(2)⇒  (1) and (3)⇒  (1) are clear.

(1)⇒  (3) Suppose ξ-(A)  ≤  n. Then there exists an ξ-exact sequence

[formula]

with Gi∈(ξ) for all 0  ≤  i  ≤  n. For every 0  ≤  i < n, considering the relevant ξ-exact sequence

[formula]

it follows that ξ-(M)  ≤  n - i. By the proof of (1)⇒  (2), we get an ξ-exact sequence

[formula]

with Gi'∈(ξ) and P∈P(ξ). So we obtain the ξ-exact sequence

[formula]

Now we only need to prove the result for i = n. Applying Corollary [\ref=cor1] to the relevant triangle Gn  →  Gn - 1  →  L  →  ΣGn, we get the triangle P  →  Gn - 1'  →  L  →  ΣP with Gn - 1'∈(ξ) and P∈P(ξ). Thus we obtain the desired ξ-exact sequence

[formula]
