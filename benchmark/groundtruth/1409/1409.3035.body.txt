A Poncelet Criterion for special pairs of conics in PG(2,p)

Introduction

In 1813 Jean-Victor Poncelet stated one of the most beautiful results in projective geometry, known as Poncelet's Porism. He proved that for two conics C and D in the real projective plane, the condition whether a polygon with n sides, which is inscribed in D and circumscribed about C, is independent of the starting point of the polygon. In particular, there cannot be such polygons with a different number of sides for a given pair of conics. A remarkable number of different proofs can be found in the literature, ranging from rather elementary proofs for special cases up to proofs using the theory of elliptic curves or measure theory (see [\cite=DR2011] for an overview). In addition to proving the statement itself, much work has been done to find criteria for the existence of such polygons for two given conics, the most advanced result given by Arthur Cayley in 1853. The aim of this paper is to look at Poncelet's Theorem for a specific pencil of conics in finite projective coordinate planes PG(2,p), p an odd prime. We describe a criterion for the existence of Poncelet Polygons in such planes. The most interesting part in this analysis is the connection between the existence of Poncelet Polygons, which can be seen as geometric objects, and the theory of quadratic residues, which is purely number theoretic.

In the first chapter, we introduce some basic notation as well as the most important definitions and results used later on. In particular, we recall some facts about conics in finite projective planes and collineations. In the second chapter, we describe the pencil of conics we are working with as well as its properties. We state a version of Poncelet's Theorem for PG(2,p) and give a proof for the conic pairs constructed before. Moreover, some crucial properties which help to find conditions about Poncelet Polygons are considered. In the third chapter, we start with a condition for the existence of Poncelet Triangles and reveal a first connection to the theory of quadratic residues. Also, we show how to reduce the problem of finding Poncelet Polygons to those with an odd number of sides. A generic example using 5-sided Poncelet Polygons shows how the Euler totient function is involved in Poncelet's Theorem in PG(2,p). This enables us to deduce more information about the relation of Poncelet Pairs of conics, which finally leads to the algorithm that allows to find Poncelet Polygons by looking at the conic equations only. In the last chapter, we take a brief look at the Euclidean plane and investigate some parallels to the formulas derived for the finite planes, as for example the half-angle formula, which can henceforth be interpreted in finite planes as well.

Preliminaries

We start with recollecting the most important definitions and facts about finite projective planes used later on in this paper (see [\cite=MR1612570]).

The triple [formula] with [formula] is called projective plane, if the following axioms are satisfied:

For any two elements [formula], P  ≠  Q, there exists a unique element [formula] with [formula] and [formula].

For any two elements [formula], g  ≠  h, there exists a unique element [formula] with [formula] and [formula].

There are four elements [formula] such that [formula] we have [formula] and [formula] with i  ≠  j implies [formula] for k  ≠  i,j.

We are only working with finite projective planes of order p, for p an odd prime, i.e.:

A finite projective plane [formula] is said to be of order p, if [formula]. It will be denoted by Pp.

A particular class of finite projective planes are so-called coordinate planes, which are constructed as follows:

The set of points [formula] is defined as

[formula]

where ~   is an equivalence relation given by

[formula]

Using the same equivalence relation, the set of lines [formula] is defined as

[formula]

The incidence relation [formula] is given by the inner product:

[formula]

The finite projective plane of order p constructed in this way is unique up to isomorphisms and denoted by PG(2,p). All points, lines, pairs of lines and conics in PG(2,p) can be described as solutions of

[formula]

with a,b,c,d,e,f∈GF(p). Another way to look at this quadratic form is to consider vTAv for v = (x,y,z) and

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=QuForm]) then corresponds to a conic if and only if the corresponding matrix A is regular. If equation ([\ref=QuForm]) corresponds to a singular matrix and is irreducible, the solution is one point only. Otherwise, if the quadratic form splits into two linear factors, it corresponds to one or two lines. In abuse of notation, by a conic we mean the set of points, the quadratic equation as well as the corresponding symmetric matrix, depending on the context. By the Chevalley-Warning Theorem, ([\ref=QuForm]) has at least one non-zero solution P = (x,y,z). If the corresponding matrix is regular, by cutting the conic with lines passing through P, it is easy to see that there are exactly p + 1 points on a conic. As usual, if O is a given conic, P a point and l a line, we call l a tangent, if it has one point in common with O, a secant, if it has two points in common with O and an external line if it misses O. P is called inner point, if there is no tangent to O through P, and exterior point, if there are two tangents from P to O. It is very convenient to work with the matrix representation of a conic, as can be seen by the following fact:

Let O be any conic in PG(2,p) and P be any point in PG(2,p). Then:

P is on O ⇔   OP is a tangent of O

P is an exterior point of O ⇔   OP is a secant of O

P is an inner point of O ⇔   OP is an external line of O

An important tool are collinear maps of PG(2,p):

If S is a regular 3  ×  3 matrix with coefficients in GF(p), then φS:PG(2,p)  →  PG(2,p), P  ↦  SP is bijective and collinear, i.e., a set of collinear points is mapped to a set of collinear points.

We may consider the map φS as a coordinate transformation. Observe, that for three points P,Q,R in PG(2,p), we have:

[formula]

For a point P and a line l in PG(2,p), we have:

[formula]

Moreover, let P1,...,Pp + 1 be the p + 1 points on a conic O and S regular. Then the points SP1,...,SPp + 1 lie again on a conic, namely on the conic φS(O) given by (S -  1)TOS- 1. In fact, we have

[formula]

A special pencil of conics in PG(2,p)

Construction and properties

In all of the following, we only consider conics of the form

[formula]

where the parameter c is a nonsquare if [formula], and a square if [formula]. To understand the properties of a pair of such conics, we first have a closer look at a specific partition of the plane PG(2,p). The idea is to start with the point P = (1,0,0) and the line g through the points (0,1,0) and (0,0,1). By looking at all linear combinations of the equations corresponding to P and g, we get a partition of the plane consisting of the p - 1 conics O1, ... ,Op - 1 as well as the point P and the line g. To see this, look at the following results:

An equation of the point P = (1,0,0) in the plane PG(2,p) is given by

[formula]

for p - c not a square in GF(p). In particular, for [formula], all nonsquares and for [formula], all squares in GF(p) can be used as the parameter c.

P = (1,0,0) clearly solves equation ([\ref=point]). As the associated matrix is singular, it describes a point, a line or a pair of lines. It is a point, if the polynomial y2 + cz2 is irreducible over GF(p). This is the case if and only if p - c is not a square in GF(p). By a well-known theorem in number theory (see [\cite=MR2445243]), we have:

[formula]

Using this result, we obtain:

[formula]

So c is a square if and only if p - c is a square for [formula]. Because of this, we can only choose nonsquares for the equation of P = (1,0,0) in such planes. Since p - 1 is not a square in GF(p), [formula], we have to choose the squares in that case.

In the construction which follows, we start with any point P and any line g, P∉g. Since there exists a collineation of PG(2,p), which maps any three noncollinear points to any other noncollinear points, we restrict the proofs, without loss of generality, to P = (1,0,0) and g the line through (0,1,0) and (0,0,1).

Let P be a point and g a line in PG(2,p), such that P∉g. Then there exist p - 1 conics O1,...,Op - 1, such that the equations corresponding to P,g,O1,...,Op - 1 are closed under addition and the zeros of these equations form a partition of the plane PG(2,p). Moreover, P is the unique point in PG(2,p), which is an inner point of all conics O1,...,Op - 1.

Without loss of generality, take P = (1,0,0) and g the line through (0,1,0) and (0,0,1). By Lemma [\ref=EquationP], the corresponding equations are given by

[formula]

for p - c not a square. Considering all nontrivial GF(p)-linear combinations of P and g leads to p - 1 conics, where we define O1: = P  +  g and Ok: = P  +  Ok - 1, i.e.,

[formula]

Note that these equations are all closed under addition. Moreover, the solutions of these equations are disjoint, since a common solution of any two equations would imply a common solution of P and g as well, which contradicts our assumption. Because of this, the solutions of these p + 1 equations give p(p + 1) + 1 = p2 + p + 1 distinct points, which are indeed all points of PG(2,p). Hence, the solutions of the p + 1 equations form a partition of PG(2,p).

For the second statement, we first have to show that P is an inner point of all conics. Note that any point on Ok has a nonzero x-coordinate, since otherwise there would be an intersection with the line g. By Lemma [\ref=AP], for any point R  =  (1,r2,r3) on Ok the tangent to Ok in R is the line (1,kr2,kcr3). The point P is an inner point of Ok, if it is not incident with any tangent of Ok. Indeed, we have

[formula]

and hence, P is not incident with any tangent of Ok for k  =  1,...,p - 1. Therefore, it is an inner point of all conics O1,...,Op - 1. It remains to show that no other point of PG(2,p) is an inner point of all these conics. Since we can exclude all points lying on some conic Ok, we just have to deal with the line g. Note that:

[formula]

Consider the point (0,0,1). This point is incident with the tangent of Ok in R  =  (1,r2,r3), if (1,kr2,kcr3)  ·  (0,0,1)  =  kcr3 is zero. Since k  ≠  0 and c  ≠  0, this is exactly the case for all points of the form R  =  (1,r2,0). Because of this, (0,0,1) is not an inner point of those conics containing such points. Since we have a partition of the plane, the existence of such conics is guaranteed. We proceed similarly for the points (0,1,α), α  =  0,...,p - 1. Such a point is incident with the tangent of Ok in R  =  (1,r2,r3) if (1,kr2,kcr3)  ·  (0,1,α)  =  kr2 + kcαr3 is zero. Since k  ≠  0, we need r2  +  cαr3 to be zero. The points Rα: = (1,α, - c- 1) satisfy this condition and for all values of α, Rα is indeed a point on some conic Ok, since we have a partition of the plane.

Let P be a point and g a line in PG(2,p) with P∉g. Let O1,...,Op - 1 be the p - 1 pairwise disjoint conics obtained by adding the equations of P and g successively. Then each line through P is a secant of all Oi, i a square in GF(p) and an external line of all Oj, j not a square in GF(p) or vice versa.

Without loss of generality, take P = (1,0,0) and g the line through (0,1,0) and (0,0,1). All p + 1 lines through P are given by

[formula]

Recall, that Ok:x2 + ky2 + kcz2  =  0 for [formula]. We start proving the theorem in planes PG(2,p), [formula]. Remember that in these planes, p - 1 is a square and c is a nonsquare. We start looking at the line sp. This line is a secant of Ok if the following equation has a solution y in GF(p):

[formula]

Since (p - 1) is a square, the equation above is solvable if and only if k- 1 is a square, which is if and only if k is a square, [formula]. Hence, z = 0 is a secant of all Ok, k a square and an external line of the remaining conics Ok, k a nonsquare. For the lines st, t = 0,...,p - 1, we see that st is a secant of Ok, if the following equation is solvable for z in GF(p):

[formula]

Note that t2 + c  ≠  0, since p - c was chosen to be a nonsquare. The equation is solvable, if k(t2 + c) is a square. For this, we find:

[formula]

Hence, st is either a secant of all Ok, k a square, or all Ok, k not a square, depending on the parameters t and c. A similar discussion covers the planes PG(2,p) for [formula].

The following property is the main building block for what follows:

None of the conics O1,...,Op - 1 have tangents in common.

Consider the conics ON and OS given by

[formula]

Let (1,N2,N3)∈ON and (1,S2,S3)∈OS, so we have

[formula]

The corresponding tangents are given by

[formula]

Assume these tangents are the same, i.e. (1,NN2,cNN3)  =  (1,SS2,cSS3). Since they both have the same entry at the first coordinate, we necessarily have

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=ConicRelation]) and ([\ref=TangentCondition]) gives indeed N = S which completes the proof.

We end this section by showing that the parameter c can indeed be chosen arbitrarily among all squares or nonsquares, without any changes of incidence relations.

Let c1 and c2 be squares in case [formula] and nonsquares in case [formula], respectively. Then the two partitions of PG(2,p) given by

[formula]

for i = 1,2 can be mapped to each other by a collinear transformation of PG(2,p).

In both case, c1c2 is a square, so we can consider the collinear map φS given by the matrix

[formula]

If O is the matrix corresponding to one of the equations defining the partition with parameter c1, then STOS is the matrix of the corresponding equation with parameter c2.

Poncelet's Theorem for conics Ok

The main goal in this section is to prove a version of Poncelet's Porism, interpreted in PG(2,p). Recall that we are only interested in pairs of conics of the form ([\ref=ConicEquation]) described in the previous section.

Consider a pair of conics (Oα,Oβ) given by ([\ref=ConicEquation]). An n-sided Poncelet Polygon is a polygon with n sides and vertices on Oβ, such that the sides are tangents of Oα.

Since the conics Ok are all disjoint and have no common tangents, as seen in Lemma [\ref=disjointtangents], we are in the particular situation that if we can find one line, which is a tangent to Oα and a secant of Oβ, this leads necessarily to a Poncelet Polygon. The version of Poncelet's Theorem we are going to prove here reads as follows:

Let (Oα,Oβ) be any pair of conics in PG(2,p) with equations of the form

[formula]

If an n-sided Poncelet Polygon can be constructed starting with a point P∈Oβ, then an n-sided Poncelet Polygon can be constructed starting with any other point Q∈Oβ as well.

We start with the result in planes PG(2,p), [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=NotDependC], it suffices to consider conics of the form

[formula]

since c = 1 is always a square. The idea is to find a collineation, which does not change the equation of the conics but maps points of the conic to each other. Since the conics in this case can be interpreted as concentric circles, we apply collineations which rotate the n-sided Poncelet Polygons suitably, i.e. we look at members of the dihedral group of p + 1 elements or a subgroup of it. Let P1,P2,...,Pn be points on Oβ which form an n-sided Poncelet Polygon with some other conic Oα. Let Q = (1,q2,q3) be any other point on Oβ. Denote P1 = P = (1,p2,p3). The goal is to find a collineation τ  =  τ(P,Q) which maps P to Q and does not change the conic equation. For this, look at:

[formula]

We want τ(P) = Q which leads to the two conditions:

[formula]

[formula]

We know that P and Q are on Oβ, which means:

[formula]

In the case p2  ≠  0 and p3  ≠  0, we immediately deduce by combining ([\ref=Crit1]) and ([\ref=Crit2]):

[formula]

Note that a and b are elements in GF(p) with the property [formula], since using ([\ref=ovalEqu]) gives:

[formula]

Because of this, τ does not change the equation of the conic, i.e. τ(Ok)  =  Ok, as can be easily checked. Hence, applying τ(P,Q) to all points Pi for i = 1,...,n yields a new Poncelet Polygon using the point Q. Similarly, the cases for P = (1,0,p3) and P = (1,p2,0) can be discussed, which completes the proof for planes PG(2,p), [formula].

It remains to prove the result in planes PG(2,p), [formula]. Remember that in these planes, all nonsquares can be taken for the parameter c. But c = 1 is a square, and we have to set up the transformation differently. Let c be an arbitrary but fixed nonsquare in GF(p). Define

[formula]

and consider the usual addition and multiplication, defined by:

[formula]

[formula]

It is well-known that [formula] is indeed a field and isomorphic to GF(p2). Let us go back to the conics Ok:k- 1x2 + y2 + cz2 = 0 in PG(2,p) we started with. The main idea is to embed these conics in PG(2,p2). First note, that ε:PG(2,p)  →  PG(2,p2),P  ↦  P is a natural embedding. Then we choose the collinear transformation φs in PG(2,p2) given by the matrix S in [formula]:

[formula]

All conics Ok in PG(2,p) are mapped by [formula] to conics S(Ok) in PG(2,p2). The equation of S(Ok) is then given by

[formula]

since

[formula]

For the tangents of Ok, we can proceed similarly by considering again the equation of S(Ok) in PG(2,p2). It is easy to check, that a tangent of Ok is mapped to a tangent of S(Ok) by [formula]. Now, on the conics S(Ok) in PG(2,p2), we can operate similarly as before. Let P1,P2,...,Pn be points on Oβ which form an n-sided Poncelet Polygon with some other conic Oα. Let Q = (1,q2,q3) be any other point on Oβ and denote P1 = P = (1,p2,p3). We look at P and Q in PG(2,p2), namely at [formula] and [formula]. The goal is to find a collineation τ  =  τ(SP,SQ) which maps SP to SQ and does not change the conic equation S(Ok). Now, we look at:

[formula]

The condition τ(SP) = SQ leads to:

[formula]

Assume again p2  ≠  0 and p3  ≠  0. The other two cases (i.e. p2 = 0 or p3 = 0) can be carried out similarly.

[formula]

[formula]

It can be checked immediately, by using P,Q∈Oβ, that:

[formula]

Hence, τ does not change the equation of S(Ok) and therefore maps points on S(Ok) to points on S(Ok). We apply τ to all points on the embedded Poncelet n-gon given by SP1,...,SPn, which gives a new Poncelet n-gon for S(Oβ) and S(Oα). It remains to show that mapping these transformed points back to PG(2,p) gives points on the original conic Oβ, i.e. we have to show that for any Pi = (1,yi,zi)∈Oβ:

[formula]

Look at the corresponding equation:

[formula]

Because of ([\ref=help1]) and Pi∈Oβ this expression indeed equals zero. Hence, we end up with a Poncelet n-gon for Oβ and Oα starting with the point Q.

Relations for pairs of conics

In this section, we consider the disposition of pairs of conics with regard to the existence of a Poncelet Polygon.

Let O and O' be two conics in PG(2,p). We say that O lies inside O', if O' consists of external points of O only. Notation: [formula].

Note that this relation is not symmetric, since there are conics O consisting of external points of O' but the converse is not true. Moreover, we can have the situation that neither O lies inside O' nor O' lies inside O.

In the following we continue to consider conics described in the previous section, i.e., conics given by the equation Ok:x2 + ky2  +  ckz2  =  0.

Let Oα and Oβ be conics in PG(2,p) of the given form, p an odd prime. If one point P∈Oβ is an external point of Oα, then [formula]. Moreover, we have [formula] if and only if:

[formula]

Let Oα and Oβ be given by:

[formula]

Remember that all points of PG(2,p) with a zero x-coordinate lie on the line g:x2 = 0, hence due to the partition not on any conic. A point P of Oβ can therefore be considered as P = (1,P2,P3). Using the conic equation, we have P22  =    -  β- 1 - cP23. By Lemma [\ref=AP], the conic Oα lies inside Oβ if for all such points P, OαP is a secant of Oα. So, the property [formula] can be equivalently expressed as follows:

[formula]

This quadratic equation is solvable for z iff its discriminant is a square in GF(p), i.e., iff

[formula]

In planes PG(2,p), [formula], c is chosen to be a nonsquare, hence we need ( - β)(β  -  α) to be a nonsquare. In planes PG(2,p), [formula], the variable c is a square, hence we need ( - β)(β  -  α) to be a square. Since the above expression is independent of the point P, it holds for every point on Oβ and we are done.

With Theorem [\ref=diamond], we can now construct chains of nested conics, since we have:

Consider two conics Oα and Oβ. Then:

[formula]

When calculating the relation [formula] for every pair in a given plane, it is useful to apply the following result.

Let (Ok,O1) be a pair of conics in PG(2,p). Then there exists a collinear transformation mapping (Ok,O1) to (Oβk,Oβ), for all [formula]. In particular, [formula] implies [formula].

We have to find a collinear transformation φS with:

[formula]

Let us start with the case of β being a square in GF(p). In this case, we are allowed to consider the square root of β, hence the following regular matrix S works, which can be checked immediately:

[formula]

For β not a square, we have to distinguish between [formula] and [formula]. In the first case, we can take any square for the parameter c in the conic equation, as seen in Lemma [\ref=diamond]. Since the relation of the conics does not depend on c by Lemma [\ref=NotDependC], we can take c = 1. Now, choose any nonzero square s in GF(p) such that β - s is a square as well. Note that we can always find such an s, because β - s runs for s a square through exactly [formula] values, since there are [formula] squares in [formula]. Then β - s  ≠  β, since we take s not to be zero. Hence, not all of those [formula] values can be nonsquares. Moreover, β - s  ≠  0 as s is a square and β a nonsquare. Hence, there is a nonzero square β - s. Therefore, the square roots of s and β - s are well-defined. Now, look at the following matrix:

[formula]

We have det (S- 1)  =  β  ≠  0 and moreover, it holds:

[formula]

This gives the valid coordinate transformation we were looking for. In planes PG(2,p), [formula], we can take any nonsquare for our parameter c. By Lemma [\ref=NotDependC], the relation of the conics does not depend on c, hence we choose a c, such that β - c is a nonzero square. To ensure the existence can be proceeded as before. For such a c, look at the matrix:

[formula]

We have det (S- 1)  =    -  β  ≠  0 and it can be checked that this is the collinear transformation we are looking for.

We want to investigate the relation [formula] in PG(2,7). Here, [formula], hence [formula] if and only if ( - β)(β  -  α) is a square in GF(7), i.e. equals 1,2 or 4. By looking at β = 1 and shifting the result using Lemma [\ref=timesBeta], we obtain the table of relations for the whole plane PG(2,7).

Using Corollary [\ref=odot], we detect the following closed chains of conics Oα  →  Oβ  →  Oβ2α- 1  →  ...

[formula]

Note that starting with two squares α and β results in a chain of conics with just squares as indices. Similarly, starting with two nonsquares as indices results in a chain of conics with only nonsquares as indices. This shows a connection of this property with cyclotomic subsets, defined by

[formula]

In GF(7), we have for example [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Since exactly half of all nonzero elements in GF(p) are squares, another immediate result is:

For every conic Oβ in PG(2,p), there are [formula] conics Oα such that [formula].

Next, we have a closer look at the relations of the points on Oα and Oβ.

Let P = (1,P2,P3) be any point on Oβ and [formula]. Then, for the contact points A1 = (1,y1,z1) and A2 = (1,y2,z2) on Oα of the tangents through P we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

To see this, we just have to solve the quadratic equation derived in Theorem [\ref=diamond]. Since [formula], we indeed get two solutions.

Let P and Q be two points on Oβ such that the line connecting P and Q is a tangent of Oα in the point A. Then

[formula]

Let P = (1,P2,P3) and Q = (1,Q2,Q3) be two points on Oβ, so we have:

[formula]

There are p + 1 points on the line through P and Q, namely

[formula]

Note that P + (p - 1)Q has a zero x-coordinate and hence gives the intersection with the line g:x2 = 0, which is clearly not a point on Oα. So we know that

[formula]

We need:

[formula]

Note that 1 - αβ- 1  ≠  0, since otherwise α  =  β. Solving for k yields

[formula]

Note that by ([\ref=UniqueK]), there can only be one solution to our problem, since we are looking for a tangent of Oα. Because of this, the radicand has to be zero, which is if and only if [formula]. Hence k = 1 or k = p - 1. Since we already excluded p - 1, we obtain k = 1, which indeed gives P + Q = A.

Let P,Q∈Oβ such that [formula]. Then there exists an [formula], α  ≠  β, such that [formula] is a tangent of Oα. The contact point is P + Q.

With P = (1,P2,P3),Q = (1,Q2,Q3), we have P + Q = (2,P2 + Q2,P3 + Q3). As the characteristic of GF(p) is odd, P + Q is not in g, where g is the unique line through (0,1,0) and (0,0,1). Since we have a partition of the plane PG(2,p), P + Q must be a point on a conic Oα. We have to exclude the possibility of [formula] being a secant of Oα. For this, note that there are p + 1 points on [formula], where P,Q∈Oβ and P + (p - 1)Q∈g. Hence, there are p - 2 points left, which is an odd number. All the other p - 2 points must lie on conics and there are at most two points on the same conic. Since p - 2 is odd and by Lemma [\ref=disjointtangents], there is exactly one conic with [formula] as a tangent. By Lemma [\ref=PlusOnA], we are done.

In the following results, an n-sided Poncelet Polygon for [formula] with vertices Bi on Oβ and contact points Ai on Oα is denoted by

[formula]

where [formula] means that the line connecting Bi and Bi + 1 is the tangent of Oα in the point Ai. By Lemma [\ref=PlusOnA], the following relations are immediate:

[formula]

Note that by combining Lemma [\ref=polarintersection] and Lemma [\ref=PlusOnA], we are now able to calculate a Poncelet Polygon by starting in a point on Oβ. Before we analyze Poncelet Polygons for different numbers of sides, we need some more properties of the points on Ok and their relations.

The conics Oα in PG(2,p), [formula], consist of the p + 1 points

[formula]

if α is a square, and otherwise

[formula]

Of course, for y  ≠  0, z  ≠  0, we have that (1,y,z)∈Oα implies that (1, - y,z)∈Oα, (1,y, - z)∈Oα and (1, - y, - z)∈Oα. So we just have to check whether (1,0,z) and (1,y,0) are on Oα as well. We have: As [formula], c is a square in GF(p) and p - 1 is not. Hence these points lie on Oα if and only if α is not a square.

The conics Oα in PG(2,p), [formula], consist of the p + 1 points

[formula]

if α is a square, and otherwise

[formula]

Proof. Again, for y  ≠  0, z  ≠  0, we have that (1,y,z)∈Oα if and only if (1, - y,z)∈Oα, (1,y, - z)∈Oα and (1, - y, - z)∈Oα. So we just have to check whether (1,0,z) and (1,y,0) are on the conics as well. Note that c is not a square and p - 1 is a square in GF(p), [formula], so similarly to the result before, we get:

The sum of all points on the conic Oα is (1,0,0).

This can be seen by checking all possible cases above.

Let [formula] be an n-sided Poncelet Polygon. Then

[formula]

Moreover, for n even, we have

[formula]

By adding the equations in ([\ref=sums]) in different ways, we obtain three conditions for n even:

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=3]) gives A2  +  A4  +  ...  +  An  =  (1,0,0), and combining ([\ref=2]) and ([\ref=3]) gives A1  +  A3  +  ...  +  An - 1  =  (1,0,0). Hence, B1  +  B2  +  ... + Bn  =  A1  +  A2  +  A3 + ... + An = (1,0,0). Note that the point (1,0,0) operates here as a neutral element concerning addition of points, since (0,0,0) is not a point in PG(2,p). The case n odd is similar.

The lines joining opposite vertices Bi and Bn + i of a 2n-sided Poncelet Polygon meet in (1,0,0). Moreover Bi + Bn + i = (1,0,0).

Again, we can use the relation Bi + Bi + 1 = Ai for the 2n-sided Poncelet Polygon given by points Bi∈Oβ and Ai∈Oα. We have:

[formula]

Adding these equations gives

[formula]

Taking all Bi to the left and all Ai to the right side gives:

[formula]

To apply Lemma [\ref=relA], we add the remaining Bi to obtain (1,0,0) on the left side:

[formula]

Rewriting the Ai in terms of Bi gives

[formula]

Hence we get

[formula]

Similarly can be proceeded for all remaining Bi + Bn + i, 1 < i  ≤  n.

Note that Lemma [\ref=evenNgon] can bee seen as a generalization of Brianchon's Theorem [\cite=LHNH].

A Poncelet Criterion

Poncelet Coefficients

Here is a first result concerning the existence of n-sided Poncelet Polygons.

Let [formula] be two conics in PG(2,p) which carry a Poncelet Triangle. Then [formula].

Let [formula] be a Poncelet Triangle. By Lemma [\ref=PlusOnA], we therefore have

[formula]

Moreover, by Lemma [\ref=relA], we have B1 + B2 + B3 = (1,0,0). This gives the following relations:

[formula]

As all lines are given by linear combinations of two points, the conditions in ([\ref=TriangleRel]) translate to

[formula]

Since there are no tangents through the point (1,0,0), as seen in Lemma [\ref=UniqueInnerPointP], these lines have to be secants of Oα and Oβ. With Theorem [\ref=QuSecants], we know that α and β are either both squares or both nonsquares. To find the remaining intersection points of [formula], [formula] and [formula] with Oα and Oβ, consider the points [formula] and [formula], where P̃: = (x, - y, - z) for a point P = (x,y,z). Since [formula] and [formula], for i = 1,2,3, these are exactly the intersection points we are looking for. Note that this construction yields another Poncelet Triangle: The second triangle is [formula], as visualized in Figure [\ref=twoTriangles]. Now, look at B1 = (1,y1,z1). The secant of Oβ through B1 and [formula] is given by

[formula]

In the case z1  ≠  0, we get the relation [formula]. Intersecting this line with the conic Oα gives:

[formula]

Using B1∈Oβ gives

[formula]

With this, we can calculate the following two intersection points for Oα:

[formula]

Using ([\ref=TriangleRel]), we obtain the condition

[formula]

Since we are in the case z1  ≠  0, it follows [formula], which implies α  =  4β. In the case z1  =  0, we directly deduce z = 0 for the secant through B1 and [formula]. Intersecting with Oα gives the two points

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=TriangleRel]), we get the condition [formula] and using B1∈Oβ yields again 4β  =  α.

Recall that for [formula], we have to check whether or not ( - β)(β  -  α) is a square. Hence, in the case 4β  =  α, we have to check whether or not 3β2 is a square, which is the same as checking, whether or not 3 is a square. Compared to results from number theory (see [\cite=MR2445243]), we indeed have the following conditions for 3 being a square :

For [formula], we have 3|(p + 1)  ⇔  3 nonsquare

For [formula], we have 3|(p + 1)  ⇔  3 square

This gives already a necessary condition for the existence of Poncelet Triangles for pairs (Oα,Oβ) in PG(2,p). By Poncelet's Theorem for such pairs, as seen in Theorem [\ref=Poncelet], the existence of a Poncelet Triangle implies 3|(p + 1), as there are p + 1 points on the conic Oβ. This is exactly the condition given by number theoretic results as well.

Using arguments as above, one easily checks the following result.

Let [formula] be two conics in PG(2,p), such that a 4-sided Poncelet Polygon can be constructed. Then 2β  =  α in GF(p).

The main goal is to find such a relation for all possible n-sided Poncelet Polygons. For this, we first investigate, which Poncelet n-gons occur in a given plane PG(2,p). Note that this can be done just by applying Poncelet's Theorem and the Euler divisor sum formula, since we are dealing with a very special family, as the following results show:

For a given conic Oβ in PG(2,p) and every n|(p + 1), there are exactly [formula] conics Oα, such that [formula] carries a Poncelet n-gon.

By Lemma [\ref=RelConics], there are exactly [formula] conics Oα, such that [formula]. Moreover, we know that once [formula], starting with any point of Oβ leads to a Poncelet Polygon. Because of Theorem [\ref=Poncelet], the length of this Poncelet Polygon has to divide p + 1, i.e. the number of points on Oβ. Recall now Euler's divisor sum formula for the totient function (see [\cite=MR2445243]):

[formula]

Applied to the points of the conic, we have:

[formula]

Hence, there have to be exactly [formula] conics Oα such that [formula] carries a Poncelet n-gon for every divisor n of p + 1.

We are interested in a criterion, which ensures the existence of an n-sided Poncelet Polygon for two related conics [formula], such as 4β  =  α for triangles. The next result reduces this problem of possibly finding such a relation for all n-sided Poncelet Polygons to those with n odd.

Let (Oβk,Oβ) be a pair of conics in PG(2,p), which carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon for k a square in GF(p). Then (Oβ,Oβ) carries a 2n-sided Poncelet Polygon, where

[formula]

where only those roots are taken such that   ≠  k.

Let [formula] be some pair of conics which carries a 2n-sided Poncelet Polygon. To calculate the relation between α and β, we use that Bi  +  Bi + 1  =  Ai for two consecutive vertices of the polygon, as seen in Lemma [\ref=PlusOnA]. Hence:

[formula]

This gives the following equation to solve:

[formula]

Since B1∈Oβ and B2∈Oβ, we know that y2i  +  cz2i  =    -  β- 1 for i = 1,2 and we obtain:

[formula]

The claim is α  =  β, hence we have to show:

[formula]

The expression above can be interpreted as an inner product. Hence, we may reformulate the condition as an incidence relation:

[formula]

This can be done for all pairs of points Bi,Bi + 1∈Oβ. We get the following conditions

[formula]

where indices are taken cyclically. Exactly n tangents of the conic Oβ are involved. The conditions above are equivalent to showing that the n intersection points are on some conic Oγ and form an n-sided Poncelet Polygon with Oβ. Observe that, by Lemma [\ref=evenNgon], Bi + n  =  i, and hence [formula]. Therefore, we have to verify that

[formula]

We directly obtain the following equation for γ:

[formula]

Since all the points (1,yi,zi) lie on Oβ, we indeed get β  =  γk. By Lemma [\ref=timesBeta] , since (Oβk,Oβ) carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon, so does (Oγk,Oγ), which is what we wanted to show.

Let Oα and Oβ be conics in PG(2,p) such that a 2n-sided Poncelet Polygon exists. Then there exists another conic Oγ such that the pair (Oγ,Oβ) carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon.

Let [formula] such that a 2n-sided Poncelet Polygon can be found and α  =  hβ. This means that

[formula]

is a square in planes PG(2,p), [formula] and a nonsquare in planes PG(2,p), [formula]. Since β2 is of course a square, we know whether or not (h - 1) is a square. To show the statement above, we only have to show that for γ  =  kβ:

[formula]

To see this, we use our formula for 2n-sided Poncelet Polygons seen in Lemma [\ref=DoublingFormula]:

[formula]

This gives us:

[formula]

So we have (h - 1) a square if and only if (k - 1) a square.

We have already seen in Lemma [\ref=4gon] that if (Ok,O1) forms a 4-sided Poncelet Polygon, we immediately have k = 2. Hence by Lemma [\ref=DoublingFormula], we are able to compute the index h such that (Oh,O1) carries an 8-sided Poncelet Polygon:

[formula]

This is only well defined if 2 is a square. For this, we use the following result from number theory (see [\cite=MR2445243]):

[formula]

By Poncelet's Theorem, the existence of an 8-gon already implies 8|(p + 1). Hence, the condition [formula] is again equivalent to a purely number theoretic result.

The next goal is to deduce such relations for all n-sided Poncelet Polygons, n odd. The main idea how to proceed lies already in the following result:

Let [formula] carry an n-sided Poncelet Polygon for the points B1,...,Bn∈O1, n odd. Then [formula] carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon as well, for the same points B1,...,Bn∈O1.

Let [formula] such that an n-sided Poncelet Polygon can be found for n odd. By Lemma [\ref=PlusOnA], we have Bi  +  Bi + 1∈Ok for all i  =  1,...,n and Bi = (1,yi,zi), hence:

[formula]

Using [formula], gives:

[formula]

This implies:

[formula]

which is equivalent to:

[formula]

Again, this relation can be reformulated as an incidence relation:

[formula]

Hence we need

[formula]

as well as

[formula]

Summarizing gives the condition gives:

[formula]

This can be done for all i  =  1,...,n and since n is odd, for [formula], an n-sided Poncelet Polygon is given via the same points B1,...,Bn.

An immediate corollary using Lemma [\ref=timesBeta] is the following:

The conics [formula] carry an n-sided Poncelet Polygon if and only if [formula] carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon.

We have seen that for triangles, there is only one conic Ok such that [formula] form a 3-sided Poncelet Polygon, namely O4. In this case, we should therefore have:

[formula]

This is equivalent with

[formula]

Hence, we obtain again the condition k = 4, which we already computed in Lemma [\ref=3coefficient] by using other methods.

The procedure shown in the proof above can be iterated. To avoid long expressions, we have:

t0: = k, [formula]

Recall that for a given Poncelet n-gon using the points B1,...,Bn on O1 and tangents of some Oα, there are [formula] more conics Oγ such that (Oγ,O1) carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon.

We know that for [formula] a 5-sided Poncelet Polygon for the same five points B1,...,B5∈Oα can be constructed in two different ways, since [formula]. Fix an ordering of the points B1,...,B5 and start with the following polygon:

[formula]

The other 5-gon is then given by connecting Bi and Bi + 2.

[formula]

Note that connecting Bi and Bi + 3 gives in fact the same polygon again, since we can read the above polygon by reversing the direction.

For 5-sided Poncelet Polygons, we therefore get the following condition:

[formula]

We have to solve:

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

We obtain the following four solutions:

[formula]

Since k = 1 and k = 4 solves t0 = t1, we find that [formula] implies that if [formula], then (Ok,O1) carries a 5-sided Poncelet Polygon. A result by Gauss about quadratic residues (see [\cite=MR2445243]) says:

[formula]

Hence in all planes PG(2,p), in which 5 actually divides p + 1, the square root of 5 is well-defined and the indices of the Poncelet 5-gons given by [formula] can be computed.

Finally, we can prove the theorem how to find the indices k, such that (Ok,O1) carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon for n odd.

Let n be any odd number, n  ≥  3. Then the indices k such that (Ok,O1) carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon in a plane PG(2,p) are given by the solutions of:

[formula]

For a fixed plane PG(2,p), these solutions are called Poncelet Coefficients for n-sided Poncelet Polygons and denoted by kin, [formula].

Let [formula] carry an n-sided Poncelet Polygon for the points B1,...,Bn, n odd. Let the points be ordered such that for [formula], we have:

[formula]

We have seen in the proof of Lemma [\ref=nextNgon] that the n-sided Poncelet Polygon of [formula] is given by the order:

[formula]

Iterating this, we see that the n-sided Poncelet Polygon given by [formula] has the ordering:

[formula]

where the indices are taken cyclically. We already know that there are exactly [formula] different Poncelet n-gons. Since we are only working with n odd, we can apply Fermat's little Theorem (see [\cite=MR2445243]) and use

[formula]

This shows directly that for [formula] we start the polygon by B1  →  B2 or B1  →  Bn and hence is equivalent with the very first n-gon. To deduce the coefficients k such that (Ok,O1) carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon, we therefore indeed have to solve ([\ref=ConditionT]).

Note that for some values of n, the iteration needs fewer steps than [formula], as the order of 2 modulo n can be smaller than [formula]. In these cases, not all indices can be constructed by starting with one Poncelet n-gon only. Nevertheless, the condition ([\ref=ConditionT]) stays the same but the same coefficients could be derived by computing less, i.e.

[formula]

where

[formula]

The smallest example for [formula] is n = 17, where we have [formula] but [formula], i.e. s17 = 4.

We want to deduce the indices k such that [formula] carries a 9-sided Poncelet Polygon in PG(2,53). Since [formula], we have to solve:

[formula]

So we need solutions of:

[formula]

Rewriting this equation, we have to solve:

[formula]

We obtain the following solutions:

[formula]

Since we can exclude the solutions 1 and 4, as they also solve t2 = t3, we deduce that:

[formula]

are the pairs of conics in PG(2,53) such that a 9-sided Poncelet Polygon can be constructed.

Poncelet Polynomials

We are now able to give an algorithm to deduce for all pairs (Oα,Oβ) in PG(2,p), whether an n-sided Poncelet Polygon can be constructed for a given n. We use the iteration method described before to find polynomials Pn(k) such that the zeros belong to the coefficients k of conics Ok, such that if [formula], then (Ok,O1) carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon. By Lemma [\ref=timesBeta], this gives information about all pairs (Oα,Oβ).

A polynomial Pn with integer coefficients is called Poncelet Polynomial for n-sided Poncelet Polygons, if the zeros modulo p correspond to the coefficients k, such that [formula] carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon in PG(2,p).

We have already seen in Lemma [\ref=3coefficient] that P3(k) = k - 4 and in Example [\ref=5example] that P5(k) = 16 - 12k + k2.

By Lemma [\ref=howMany], we know that all these polynomials Pn are of degree [formula], as the existence of one conic Ok, such that (Ok,O1) carries an n-sided Poncelet Polygon in PG(2,p) leads to [formula] such conics Ok. Until now, we only know how to produce Poncelet Polynomials Pn for n odd, but similar to the Poncelet Coefficients k, a doubling process can be applied for finding Pn with n even. Note that to find the coefficients for an odd n-sided Poncelet Polygon, we look for indices k, such that:

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=DoublingFormula] gives:

[formula]

We have P3(k) =  - 4 + k and φ(3) = 2. Hence we have to calculate:

[formula]

Dividing by P3(k) gives P6(k) = 4 - 3k.

For the general case, note that for numbers n and m which have the same value φ(n) = φ(m), it has to be checked by hand, which polynomials of degree [formula] given by the iteration belong to the n-gons and which to the m-gons. For example, the iteration for [formula] gives the following polynomial:

[formula]

Excluding the factors (k - 4) and (k - 1) which already occur at the first iteration, we find checking by hand:

[formula]

With some computational effort, we are now able to create a list of all Poncelet Polynomials Pn up to a chosen value of n. Using this list, we can write down an algorithm to find the numbers k, such that (Ok,O1) form an n-sided Poncelet Polygon, for all [formula] in a plane PG(2,p). Hence, by recollecting the results described in this discussion, we obtain the algorithm we were looking for, which is described in the following corollary:

The following four steps give a complete description of n-sided Poncelet Polygons for conic pairs (Oα,Oβ) in PG(2,p).

Deduce all n  ≥  3 with n|(p + 1). For every such n, calculate [formula], which gives the number of indices k, such that an n-sided Poncelet Polygon can be constructed for (Ok,O1).

For all values n obtained in Step 1, look up the Poncelet Polynomial Pn.

For every Pn deduced in Step 2, solve Pn(k) = 0 modulo p. This gives the corresponding Poncelet Coefficients k, such that an n-sided Poncelet Polygon can be constructed for (Ok,O1).

By using the coordinate transformation described in Lemma [\ref=timesBeta], transform the information obtained in Step 3 to all pairs [formula].

We want to deduce all relations of conic pairs [formula] in the plane PG(2,11). By following the above algorithm, we have:

Step 1: The values n, such that an n-sided Poncelet Polygon can be constructed, are given by n = 3,4,6,12. Moreover:

n 3 4 6 12 [formula] 1 1 1 2

Step 2: We have the following Poncelet Polynomials:

[formula]

Step 3: The zeros of the Poncelet Polynomials in GF(11) are given by:

[formula]

Step 4: By suitable collinear transformations, we obtain the complete relation table:

O1 O2 O3 O4 O5 O6 O7 O8 O9 O10 O1 12 3 4 6 12 O2 4 12 3 6 12 O3 6 12 4 12 3 O4 3 4 6 12 12 O5 6 3 12 4 12 O6 12 4 12 3 6 O7 12 12 6 4 3 O8 3 12 4 12 6 O9 12 6 3 12 4 O10 12 6 4 3 12

Comparison to other methods

Comparison to the Euclidean Plane

Recall that any point on Ok:x2 + ky2 + ckz2 = 0 has a nonzero x-coordinate. Because of this, we can project these conics on the affine plane by setting x = 1. Moreover, we can look at real solutions of the equations. In the proof of Poncelet's Theorem for this family of conics, we have seen that there is an affine transformation which maps the whole family into a family of concentric circles. Let us therefore consider pairs of circles in the Euclidean plane, i.e.

[formula]

We are now trying to find a suitable radius r for Er, such that a regular n-sided polygon which is inscribed in Er and circumscribed about E1 can be constructed. It is elementary, that one solution to this problem, namely the circumcircle radius r of a simple, regular n-sided polygon is given by:

[formula]

In terms of Poncelet Coefficients as defined for the finite case, this gives:

[formula]

The radius r for a simple, regular 5-gon is therefore given by [formula]. Note that [formula], which is exactly one of the zeros of the Poncelet Polygon for 5-gons we obtained over finite fields (see Example [\ref=5example]). The second radius [formula], which corresponds to the complex 5-gon circumscribed about E1, can be calculated as well, namely by [formula], which leads to [formula]. Hence we obtain [formula], which belongs to the second coefficient for 5-gons obtained in the finite case as well.

Now we turn our attention to the formula deduced for the coefficients [formula] for 2n-sided Poncelet Polygons in Lemma [\ref=DoublingFormula]. For this, note that:

[formula]

Hence we get:

[formula]

which is exactly the formula derived for the finite case.

Since there does not exist a radical expression for [formula] for all integers n, it is convenient to look again at polynomials with roots [formula]. These are closely connected to the n-th cyclotomic polynomials Φn(x). Recall, that those polynomials can be written as

[formula]

It is immediate that the degree of Φn is φ(n), the Euler totient function. The zeros of Φn(x) are given by [formula] for (k,n) = 1. For a zero x of Φn, also [formula] is a zero. Define:

[formula]

The zeros of qn are then given by [formula]. Next, define

[formula]

which has zeros [formula]. In the next step, we consider

[formula]

which has zeros [formula] for k = 1,...,n - 1. Finally, consider

[formula]

with zeros [formula], which is exactly the polynomial we wanted. Summarizing, we have

[formula]

with zeros [formula] for (k,n) = 1.

For n = 5, the cyclotomic polynomial is given by Φ5(x) = x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1, which leads to

[formula]

which indeed has the zeros [formula] and [formula]. Note that this is the Poncelet Polynomial for 5-gons derived in the finite case.

Comparison to Cayley's Criterion

The criterion deduced by Cayley in 1853 (see [\cite=DR2011]) reads as follows:

Let C and D be the matrices corresponding to two conics generally situated in the projective plane. Consider the expansion

[formula]

Then an n-sided Poncelet Polygon with vertices on C exists if and only if for n = 2m + 1, we have

[formula]

and for n = 2m, we have

[formula]

In the discussion above, we were mainly interested in pairs of conics (Ok,O1) with equations

[formula]

[formula]

To apply Cayley's criterion, we therefore have to look at the expansion of the square root of

[formula]

which is given by

[formula]

The condition for a 3-sided Poncelet Polygon is given by vanishing of the coefficient of t2 which is [formula]. This expression is zero if and only if k - 4 = 0, which is exactly the condition derived in Lemma [\ref=3coefficient] for the finite case.

The condition for 5-sided Poncelet Polygons is given by A2A4  -  A23 = 0, which is the same as [formula]. This is equivalent to k2 - 12k + 16 = 0, so again, we obtain the same condition as for the finite case (compare to Example [\ref=5example]).

Conclusion and outlook

The most interesting result in this discussion is that in finite geometries, the condition whether we can find Poncelet Polygons for a given pair of conics relies on number theoretic results, in particular on the theory of quadratic residues and polynomials over finite fields. It reveals to be the same criterion as in the Euclidean plane, where the conditions are derived by using tools such as angle and length, hence tools which are a priori not available in finite planes. The main aim is therefore to get a better understanding of this connection and try to extend the results for arbitrary pairs of conics in finite projective coordinate planes and to reveal other connections between the theory of quadratic residues and trigonometry. Moreover, we want to understand how the situation changes when considering planes of prime power order rather than planes over prime fields. Also, by having a closer look at chains of the conics described above, more insight into their cyclomic behavior could be obtained, in particular when considering the cyclic representation of the plane.
