A Superdimension Formula for [formula]-Modules

Introduction

The superdimension of a [formula]-graded vector space [formula] is defined to be

[formula]

It was conjectured in 1994 by Kac and Wakimoto that the superdimension of a finite-dimensional simple module of a basic Lie superalgebra [formula] is nonzero if and only if the atypicality is maximal [\cite=KW]. This conjecture was supported by a theorem stating that the evaluation of the so-called Bernstein-Leites (super)character is nonzero exactly under this condition. At the time, there was no character formula for Lie superalgebras, and it was not known precisely how the Bernstein-Leites character was related to the actual character of the module. The conjecture was finally proved by Serganova but without giving a formula for the superdimension [\cite=S3].

Major progress has been made since then on the character theory for basic Lie superalgebras. In 1996, Serganova gave a general character formula for finite dimensional irreducible representations of [formula] in terms of generalized Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials [\cite=S1] [\cite=S2]. Brundan, in 2003, gave an explicit algorithm for computing these generalized Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials [\cite=B]. In 2007, Su and Zhang used Brundan's algorithm to prove a character formula which consists of a finite alternating sum of Bernstein-Leites characters (see Theorem [\ref=SZ_formula]).

In this paper we use the Su-Zhang character formula to give a formula for the superdimension of a simple finite dimensional [formula]-module [formula] with highest weight Λ. When Λ is of maximal atypicality, the formula consists of a product of two positive terms. The first term, denoted by [formula], is the maximal number of monomials that can appear in a Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial KΛ,μ for any weight μ. As shown by Su and Zhang, this number can be computed easily using Brundan's algorithm (see Equation ([\ref=size_of_s_Lambda])). The second term is equal to the dimension of a simple module of a Lie algebra isomorphic to [formula]. Using the dimension formula for simple Lie algebras, we obtain:

Let ΓΛ be a maximal set of isotropic roots which are mutually orthogonal and orthogonal to Λ  +  ρ and let M+Λ be the set of even positive roots of [formula] orthogonal to ΓΛ. Then

[formula]

where [formula].

This formula coincides with the superdimenstion formula proven in [\cite=HW] and [\cite=W] using categorical methods and Duflo-Serganova functors, see Remark [\ref=translationRemark]. It would be interesting to find a simple proof for Theorem [\ref=main_thm] which extends to representations of other types of Lie superalgebras.

Preliminaries

Let [formula] denote the Lie superalgebra [formula], and without loss of generality assume m  ≥  n. Let [formula] denote the Cartan subalgebra of [formula]. We use the standard notation for the odd and even roots, namely

[formula]

[formula]

We normalize the bilinear form on [formula] so that for all i,j we have (εi,εj) = δi,j, (δi,δj) =  - δi,j, and (εi,δj) = 0 where δi,j is the Kronecker delta function.

We fix our choice of simple roots to be the standard one, that is

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be the corresponding sets of even and odd positive roots, respectively. Let Q+ denote the [formula]-span of the positive roots of [formula]. Let p denote the parity function on the roots of [formula], and extend p to Q+ in the natural way. We shall use the standard partial order on [formula] defined by λ  ≥  μ if λ  -  μ∈Q+. Let [formula] For [formula], we say that μ is dominant (resp. strictly dominant) if [formula] (resp. [formula]) for all [formula]. Let R and [formula] be the Weyl denominator and superdenominator, respectively, that is

[formula]

A root of a Lie superalgebra is isotropic if it is orthogonal to itself. The isotropic roots of [formula] are precisely the odd roots. For a Lie superalgebra [formula], we define the defect of [formula], denoted [formula], to be the size of a maximal set of isotropic positive roots which are mutually orthogonal. For [formula], with m  ≥  n, we have [formula].

Let L(Λ) be a simple finite-dimensional representation of highest weight Λ. Note that Λ is a dominant weight, and since we chose the standard set of simple roots, Λ  +  ρ is strictly dominant. Let [formula] be a maximal set of isotropic roots, which are orthogonal to each other and to Λ  +  ρ. Since Λ  +  ρ is strictly dominant, this set is unique. The atypicality of Λ is defined to be r  =  |ΓΛ|.

We set MΛ to be the set of even roots of [formula] orthogonal to ΓΛ, and let [formula] be the Lie algebra with root system MΛ. Note that if r = n, [formula]. Denote [formula], [formula] and [formula] We denote the simple [formula] module of highest weight μ by [formula]. We use the same notation for a weight [formula] and its restriction to [formula].

Given a weight space decomposition [formula] the character and supercharacter of L(Λ) are given by

[formula]

Note that these characters yield functions on [formula], defined by eλ(h)  =  eλ(h) for [formula] and [formula]. For f a function on [formula], let [formula] denote evaluation at 0. We have

[formula]

The Weyl group W acts on the space E of rational functions in [formula], [formula], by [formula]. Let [formula] denote the length function of W. For W'  ⊆  W and X∈E, we denote

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main_thm]

The Su-Zhang character formula gives the character of a finite-dimensional irreducible [formula]-module L(Λ). We use this formula to derive a formula for the supercharacter, which we evaluate at zero to find the superdimension of L(Λ).

The Su-Zhang Character Formula

To state the Su-Zhang formula, we need additional notation. In particular, we shall introduce two subsets of the Weyl group W of [formula], denoted SΛ and Cr.

We denote the elements of ΓΛ by [formula] where βk  =  εik  -  δjk, and [formula]. Note that this notation imposes an order on ΓΛ. We embed Symr in the Weyl group W of [formula] by sending the transposition [formula] to the product of reflections [formula]. Thus [formula] maps to an element of W which interchanges βk and [formula]. Note that for [formula] and σ∈Symr, we have [formula].

To define SΛ, we recall the weight diagram construction introduced in [\cite=BS]. We write

[formula]

To construct the weight diagram of Λ  +  ρ, we assign a symbol to each integer k, according to the rule

[formula]

We number the ×  's from left to right. For example, if

[formula]

then the corresponding weight diagram is

[formula]

For [formula], we say that βk and [formula] are strongly connected if for every [formula], the number of entries [formula] between ×  k and ×  i in the weight diagram for Λ  +  ρ is less than or equal to the number of entries ×   between ×  k and ×  i. In the example above, β1 and β2 are strongly connected, as are β1 and β3; however, β2 and β3 are not strongly connected. For each [formula], let [formula] be the largest t  ≤  r such that βs and βt are strongly connected.

Let

[formula]

By [\cite=SZ1], we obtain

[formula]

In [\cite=HW], the formula for the superdimension is described using a cup diagram which connects ×  's and [formula]'s (which are denoted there by [formula] and [formula], respectively). In that notation, two roots are strongly connected if and only if the corresponding cups are nested. Thus, sΛ coincides with the formula for m(λ) in Section 14 of [\cite=HW].

Let Cr be the set of cyclic permutations of order r, that is, all permutations of the form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. For π∈Cr, we define

[formula]

We define the operation [formula] for [formula] by setting [formula] to be the maximal weight in [formula] where the coefficients of δjk in μ are weakly increasing or, equivalently, the coefficients of εjk in μ are weakly decreasing (with the notation of [\cite=SZ1], [formula]).

For [formula], let [formula]. We define |λ  -  μ| by [formula].

With the notation above, we have:

[\cite=SZ1] The character of a finite dimensional simple [formula]-module with highest weight Λ is given by

[formula]

We transform this character formula to a formula for the supercharacter. For [formula] let

[formula]

Expanding each term [formula] as a geometric series, and changing signs as appropriate, we obtain

[formula]

Evaluation

We now compute the superdimension of L(Λ) by evaluating the formula for the supercharacter in ([\ref=sch]). We first show that many of the terms evaluate to the same number.

For any [formula] with μ  +  ρ MΛ-dominant, [formula].

Let WΛ be the subgroup of W generated by roots from MΛ and let W1 be a set of left coset representatives, so that W  =  W1WΛ. We have

[formula]

Since Λ is dominant, μ  +  ρ  -  ρ0Λ is MΛ-dominant, the Weyl character formula implies

[formula]

Since [formula] is W1-anti-invariant, we have

[formula]

The number of zeros minus the number of poles of the term [formula] at 0 is (m - r)(n - r). Indeed [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Since (m - r)(n - r)  ≥  0, we can evaluate [formula] term by term, that is

[formula]

Since Λ  -  μ is orthogonal to MΛ, we get that

[formula]

Since [formula], the evaluation is the same as desired.

We use the following theorem of Kac and Wakimoto to compute [formula] (note with the notation of [\cite=KW], [formula]).

[\cite=KW] One has

[formula]

Since [formula] is contained in [formula] for every π∈Cr and σ∈SΛ, Lemma 1 implies that each term [formula] is equal to the constant [formula]. Hence, if [formula], the formula evaluates to 0, completing the proof for this case. If [formula], we have

[formula]

By the dimension formula for simple Lie algebras we have

[formula]

To complete the proof of the Theorem [\ref=main_thm], it remains to prove the following lemma.

For r > 0, we have [formula]

The parity of a permutation π∈Symr is r plus the number t of cycles of π. Splitting the sum on the left hand side based on the number of cycles we perform the following calculation using generating functions, where

[formula]

Examples

Let us illustrate our formula with a few examples. We use the vector notation for the weights of [formula], namely

[formula]

Note that ai = bj means that [formula]. Shifting the highest weight of a [formula]-module by [formula] does not change the superdimension of the module. Similarly, shifting the highest weight of a [formula]-module by [formula], [formula] does not change the dimension. Thus, the computations below are done up to a multiple of [formula] and [formula].

The trivial representation

The highest weight of the trivial representation is Λ = 0, so

[formula]

and sΛ  =  1. We have that [formula] and ρ  -  ρ0Λ = 0. Thus, our formula gives that the superdimension of the trivial representation is equal to the dimension of the trivial representation of [formula] which is 1 as desired.

The natural representation

Let V be the natural representation of [formula]. Let us show that our formula gives [formula].

The highest weight of V is Λ  =  ε1, so we have [formula], and sΛ = 1. Then the atypicality is n for m  >  n, and n - 1 for m  =  n. In the latter case, we have r  ≠  n, and so our formula gives 0 for the superdimension, as desired.

For m  >  n, MΛ  =  {εi  -  εj|i,j  ≤  m - n}, and we have Λ  +  ρ  -  ρ0Λ  =  ε1. However, this is the highest weight of the natural representation of [formula], and we get [formula].

The adjoint representation

Let V be the irreducible component of the adjoint representation of [formula] corresponding to [formula] for m  >  n, and to [formula] for m  =  n. Then

[formula]

The highest weight of V is the highest root Λ  =  ε1  -  δn and

[formula]

For m  =  n, sΛ  =  2 and [formula]. We obtain [formula]. For m  =  n + 1, we have |ΓΛ|  =  n - 1. So [formula], and our formula gives 0. Finally, for m  >  n + 1, sΛ  =  1 and

[formula]

Thus Λ  +  ρ  -  ρ0Λ  =  ε1  -  εm - n + 1 which is the highest weight of the adjoint representation of [formula] and we get that [formula] as required.
