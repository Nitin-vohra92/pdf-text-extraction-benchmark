Large low-energy M1 strength for 56,57Fe within the nuclear shell model

Gamma-absorption and decay properties of atomic nuclei are of crucial importance in fundamental and applied nuclear-physics research. They give information on the nuclear structure and are indispensable for cross-section calculations for a broad range of applications, such as next-generation nuclear reactors and for the description of the nucleosynthesis in explosive stellar environments.

For γ-absorption cross sections above the particle thresholds, data are fairly complete for nuclei close to the valley of stability [\cite=dietrich1988], although still very scarce for exotic nuclei (see e.g. Refs. [\cite=adrich2005] [\cite=rossi2013]). The Giant Electric Dipole Resonance (GDR) is the dominant feature and its E1 strength overshadows all other decay modes for Eγ  ≈  12 - 17 MeV. Below the neutron threshold, the γ-ray strength function (γSF), i.e. the average, reduced γ-decay probability, is not as well known as the photoneutron cross sections, although more and more pieces to the full picture are emerging [\cite=ocl-website].

Over the past 10 years, measurements on the γSF of many fp-shell [\cite=voinov2004] [\cite=larsen2006] [\cite=larsen2007] [\cite=voinov2010] [\cite=burger2012] [\cite=larsen2013] and [formula] nuclei [\cite=guttormsen2005] [\cite=wiedeking2012] have revealed a surprising feature: the probability of γ decay increases as the γ-ray energy decreases. Such a behavior is the complete opposite of what was expected from traditional E1 models, both semi-phenomenological approaches (e.g. Ref. [\cite=kopecky1990]) and more microscopic ones (e.g. Ref. [\cite=goriely2002]). However, recent theoretical work on Mo isotopes show that a low-energy increase in the γSF could be due to thermal single-quasiparticle transitions into the continuum, giving rise to enhanced E1 strength for low γ-ray energies [\cite=litvinova2013]. On the other hand, shell-model calculations on 94,95Mo and 90Zr give high B(M1) values for low γ-rays caused by a spin re-coupling of high-j proton and neutron orbits [\cite=schwengner2013].

The low-energy enhancement is very intriguing, as it may represent a completely new decay mode and reveal so-far unknown nuclear-structure effects; as such, it is being subject to intense research. Moreover, it may have far-reaching consequences for the rapid neutron-capture process, the astrophysical nucleosynthesis responsible for creating ≈   50% of the nuclides in the solar system [\cite=burbidge1957] [\cite=cameron1957]; the presence of an enhanced decay-probability for low-energy γ-rays may increase the (n,γ) reaction rates 1 - 2 orders of magnitude [\cite=larsen_goriely2010]. As clearly expressed in Refs. [\cite=arnould2007] [\cite=surman2014], astrophysical (n,γ) rates are vital in sophisticated r-process models.

In this Letter, we present the first large-basis shell-model calculations for the γ-decay spectra of levels up to excitation energies of ≈  8 MeV in 56Fe and 57Fe. The calculations reveal a strong M1 component in the γSF for low-energy γ-rays. The shape of the calculated M1 γSF is in excellent agreement with the data of Refs. [\cite=voinov2004] [\cite=larsen2013]. Moreover, we investigate the role of E2 γ-rays, as it was found in Ref. [\cite=larsen2013] that a small contribution (≈  10%) of stretched E2 transitions could possibly be present. Also, the mechanism behind the enhancement will be explained.

We used the GPFX1A Hamiltonian [\cite=gx1a1] [\cite=gx1a2] for the pf shell. Excitation energies obtained with this Hamiltonian in the region of 56Fe are in excellent agreement with experimental energies up to about 8 MeV when the J value is known experimentally [\cite=gx1a1]. The model space for 56Fe was (0f7 / 2)6 - t(0f5 / 2,1p3 / 2,1p3 / 2)t for protons and (0f7 / 2)8 - t(0f5 / 2,1p3 / 2,1p3 / 2)t + n for neutrons, where n = 2 and t = 0, 1 and 2. The lowest lying states are dominated by t = 0, but the core-excitations with higher t values are required for states up to about 8 MeV. With this model space there are a total of 6,046,562 states. With the code NuShellX [\cite=nushellx] the Lanczos method was used to obtain the eigen-energies and eigen-vectors for the lowest 50 states of each J value with an accuracy of about 1 keV. This provides a complete set of states within the model space up to about 7.5 MeV. There are 255 positive-parity states up to 7.5 MeV for 56Fe. This model space does not include the negative-parity states that start experimentally with the 3- level at 4.37 MeV.

We calculated the complete set of M1 and E2 matrix elements for the 50 positive-parity states of each spin, a total of about 105 matrix elements. These were used to calculate lifetimes, branching ratios and mixing ratios for the γ decay. For E2 we used the standard effective charges of ep = 1.5 and en = 0.5. For the M1 transitions, we used the effective M1 operator of Ref. [\cite=effM1]. The matrix elements for the E2 were obtained with harmonic-oscillator radial wavefunctions.

For 57Ni (with n = 3) it was only possible to include t = 0 and 1. There are 233,793 negative-parity states in this model space for 57Fe. This truncation for 56Fe reduces the number of states up to 7.5 MeV by about 30%. The considered spin range was J = 0 - 10 and J = 1 / 2 - 21 / 2 for 56,57Fe, respectively.

For each level, detailed decay information is available, such as the branching ratios, the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole transition strengths B(M1) and B(E2) for each individual transition, as well as the mixing ratio δ defined as δ2  =  λE2  /  λM1, where λE2 and λM1 are the E2 and M1 transition rates. The calculated transitions were sorted into matrices with 200-keV wide energy bins, both for the initial excitation energy and the transition energy, incrementing the B(M1) transition strengths. Moreover, we have calculated the average B(M1) γ-decay transition strengths for each (Eγ,Ei) pixel simply by dividing each pixel with the number of M1 transitions in that pixel in the same way as in Ref. [\cite=schwengner2013]. By sorting the information in this way, we obtain (Eγ,Ei) matrices that correspond to the experimental situation, such as the data of 56Fe, Fig. 3 in Ref. [\cite=larsen2013]. The ([formula]) matrices from the shell-model calculations are shown for 56,57Fe in Fig. [\ref=fig:BM1_matrices] a and b, respectively. Note that the B(M1) values are from both pure and E2-mixed M1 transitions.

The obtained shell-model level densities are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:nld] and compared to experimental data (both parities). The theoretical level density for 56Fe is a little lower than experiment due to the presence of negative parity states. The theoretical level density for 57Fe is lower than experiment also due to the truncation. To examine the effect of truncation we have also done 56Fe with the more restrictive t  ≤  1 truncation. Even though the level density becomes factor of two lower, the γSF obtained for 56Fe is within ≈  10% of that for the larger basis. Thus, the γSF depends mainly on the wavefunction properties and not strongly on the level density. For the following discussion, we restrict ourselves to the excitation-energy range 5.8  ≤  Ei  ≤  8.0 MeV for 56Fe, and 5.0  ≤  Ei  ≤  8.0 MeV for 57Fe.

Following the analysis of Ref. [\cite=schwengner2013], the M1 γSF, fM1(Eγ), is obtained from the average B(M1) values by

[formula]

where the constant 16π / 9(3  =  11.5473  ×  10- 9 μ- 2NMeV- 2, [formula] is given in units of μ2N and ρi is the density of levels (in MeV- 1) having at least one M1 transition at the initial excitation energy Ei. The resulting shell-model M1 strength functions are compared to data in Fig. [\ref=fig:gsf]. Clearly, the fM1 component is strongly increasing as the γ-ray energy decreases, reproducing the trend observed in the data. Some discrepancy with the 3He-induced data [\cite=voinov2004] is observed for the low-energy transitions ([formula] MeV). However, experimental and methodical difficulties prevented the extraction of data below Eγ  ≈  2 MeV for the (p,p')56,57Fe [\cite=larsen2013] [\cite=larsen2014]. These problems would be expected also for the 3He-induced reactions, giving less confidence in these data points.

There is a very interesting question whether this low-energy enhancement is related to the populated spin range of the initial excited levels. Experiments on 95Mo using the two different charged-particle reactions (3He,αγ)95Mo [\cite=guttormsen2005] and (d,p)95Mo [\cite=wiedeking2012], led to very similar shapes of the γSF, although the 3He-induced pick-up reaction is expected to populate higher spins on average, due to its preference for high-[formula] transfer (see, e.g., Ref. [\cite=casten1972]). Furthermore, the shell-model calculations of Ref. [\cite=schwengner2013] gave that on average, all the included initial spins (Ji  =  0 - 6) contributed approximately the same to the low-energy enhancement. The Brink hypothesis [\cite=brink1955] implies that the strength function is independent of spin and excitation energy and is the same as that for the ground state. In our calculations the M1 strength function for the ground state (Ei = Eγ in Fig. [\ref=fig:BM1_matrices]) is dominated by a spin-flip resonance around 7 MeV. When considering decay to all available levels at high excitation energies, the M1 strength function is broad with a significant low-energy component. This result was also found for the Gamow-Teller strength function at high excitation in the sd shell basis  [\cite=misch]. Thus, we should think of a "modified" Brink hypothesis where the strength is different from that of the ground state, and becomes independent of excitation energy and spin above some given excitation energy.

To address the possible spin dependence, we have deduced the γSF of 56Fe for various restrictions of the initial spin, see Fig. [\ref=fig:spin]. It is remarkable how persistent the low-energy enhancement is, regardless of the imposed spin restrictions. Specifically, we find no large deviations whether the initial spins are even or odd, or for the spin ranges resembling the experimental situation for (p,p')56Fe (Ji  ≈  1 - 6 [\cite=larsen2013]) or (3He,α)56Fe (Ji  ≈  1 - 8 [\cite=voinov2004]). Also tested (but not shown) are the strong restrictions Ji = 0 - 4 and Ji = 5 - 10. Again, the low-energy part (Eγ  <  3 MeV) remains largely unaffected. We therefore conclude that the M1 γSF is, at least in this case, not very sensitive to the initial spin distribution, in agreement with experiments and the modified Brink hypothesis.

Another and equally intriguing aspect of the Brink hypothesis is that the γSF is assumed to be independent on excitation energy. Experimentally, this has been investigated by extracting the γSF from different excitation-energy ranges (e.g. in Ref. [\cite=voinov2004]). We do the same test here by deducing the average γSF for two different excitation-energy regions. We find that the shapes of the γSF's agree surprisingly well, and even the absolute strength is typically within 10% for each 200-keV bin for Eγ < 3 MeV. This fact further supports the experimental findings, and is again corroborating a modified Brink hypothesis.

To understand the origin of the low-energy M1 strength, we restricted the M1 matrix elements to the simple orbital combinations as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:spin]c. From this we find that the high [formula] diagonal terms are most important for the lowest energy M1. It is very likely that these types of "0ω" diagonal terms with high [formula] should contribute to M1 spectra in all nuclei. This mechanism is different than the suggestion made in Ref. [\cite=schwengner2013] that the M1 low energy enhancement has a similar origin as the shears mode. In this mass region the shears mode comes from configurations with f7 / 2 proton holes and g9 / 2 neutron particles. These are not in our model space, but should not be important until higher excitation energies. For E1, in contrast, there are no diagonal terms due to the parity change, and the strong matrix elements involve those in the giant-dipole resonance with a transition energy on the order of 1ω. In deformed nuclei the "0ω" diagonal terms are responsible for the orbital M1 "scissors" mode [\cite=heyde2010] observed experimentally in the low-energy γSF of deformed heavy nuclei [\cite=guttormsen2014].

To investigate the impact of the E2 transitions, we consider the average fraction of the E2's to the transition rates given by δ2 / (1 + δ2), for which we obtain distributions as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:delta]. We see that indeed, there is a certain contribution from E2 transitions, and in fact mostly so for γ-ray energies larger than the experimental low-energy enhancement region. From our calculations, we find that the average contribution from E2's is ≈  22% and ≈  15% for 56,57Fe, respectively which is somewhat more than the experimental findings of about 10% from angular distributions [\cite=larsen2013]. However, a possible low-energy E1 contribution in the experimental data might lead to a lower E2 fraction.

Moreover, the influence of stretched (ΔJ  =  1) versus non-stretched (ΔJ  =  0) M1's is studied by extracting the γSF for these transitions separately. On average, the stretched transitions give ≈  30% stronger B(M1)'s than the non-stretched in the case of 56Fe. This corresponds very well with experimental observations from angular-distribution measurements [\cite=larsen2013]. For 57Fe, the calculations indicate that the non-stretched transitions dominate by ≈  20%.

In summary, we have performed large-basis shell-model calculations of 56,57Fe, which clearly give a large M1 strength for low γ-ray energies and at high excitation energies. The shell-model fM1 functions are in excellent agreement with experimental data, and provide an explanation for the observed low-energy enhancement. Furthermore, restrictions on the M1 matrix elements clearly show that 0ω transitions are responsible for the large low-lying strength. As this type of transitions should be present for all nuclei, such a low-energy enhancement would be expected throughout the nuclear chart. Its presence may significantly increase astrophysical (n,γ) reaction rates crucial for the understanding of the r-process.
