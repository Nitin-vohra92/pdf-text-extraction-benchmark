Introduction

Recently, a method for solving the eigenvalue problem of integrable models with generic integrable boundary conditions, i.e., the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz (ODBA) was proposed in [\cite=Cao1] and several long-standing models [\cite=Cao1] [\cite=lcysw14] [\cite=ZCYSW14] [\cite=Cao14] [\cite=Li14] [\cite=Hao14] [\cite=Cao14-1] were solved. The central idea of the method is to construct a proper T - Q relation [\cite=bax] with an extra off-diagonal (or inhomogeneous) term based on the functional relations among eigenvalues of transfer matrices. However, there are still some concerns about the completeness and uniqueness of the solutions in this scheme [\cite=Nep13-1] [\cite=jiang] [\cite=nicc14-1]. In fact, the completeness of the Bethe Ansatz solutions or the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAEs) for the integrable models has been a longstanding problem for many years and some attention has still been paid very recently [\cite=Nepo14]. In this paper, we take the XXZ spin chains (especially the U(1)-symmetry-broken ones) as examples to prove that the functional relations (necessary conditions that the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix must obey) derived in the framework of the ODBA are also sufficient conditions to determine the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix. Therefore, those functional relations completely characterize the spectrum of the transfer matrix in terms of certain minimal inhomogeneous T - Q relation, which gives rise to the Bethe ansatz solution to the underlying model.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we briefly review the construction of the ODBA functional relations of the XXZ spin-[formula] chain with anti-periodic boundary condition and with generic open boundary conditions. In section 3, we prove that each solution of the ODBA functional relations can be parameterized by a polynomial Q-function in term of an inhomogeneous T - Q relation and therefore the solution set of the functional relations obtained via ODBA coincides exactly with the set of the eigenvalues of the corresponding transfer matrix, in sense that a corresponding eigenstate of the transfer matrix can be constructed with this inhomogeneous T - Q relation formalism. Section 4 is attributed to the case of open spin-s chain. Concluding remarks and some discussion are given in section 5.

Complete spectrum of the transfer matrix

XXZ spin-[formula] chain with anti-periodic boundary condition

The Hamiltonian of the XXZ spin-[formula] chain of length N is

[formula]

where η is anisotropic (or crossing) parameter, σx,  σy,  σz are the usual Pauli matrices and the anti-periodic boundary condition is given by

[formula]

The integrability of the model [\cite=Yun95] [\cite=Bat95] [\cite=Gal08] [\cite=Nie09] [\cite=Nic13] is associated with the following transfer matrix:

[formula]

with the one-row monodronomy matrix defined by

[formula]

where [formula] are generic free complex parameters which are usually called inhomogeneous parameters. The well-known six-vertex R-matrix [formula] (with V a two-dimensional vector space) reads

[formula]

Here and below we adopt the standard notations: for any matrix A∈End(V), Aj is an embedding operator in the tensor space [formula], which acts as A on the j-th space and as identity on the other factor spaces; Rij(u) is an embedding operator of R-matrix in the tensor space, which acts as identity on the factor spaces except for the i-th and j-th ones. The commuting property = 0 ensures the integrability of the model.

It was shown [\cite=Cao1] that for generic {θj} the transfer matrix satisfies the following operator identities

[formula]

Moreover the transfer matrix also enjoys the following properties

[formula]

Let us denote the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix t(u) as Λ(u). The above operator relations enable us to derive that Λ(u) satisfies the following equations

[formula]

Similar relations ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-1]) were also derived in [\cite=Nic13] with the separation of variables method. In addition, the operator product identities in the homogeneous limit (i.e. θj  →  0) reads.

[formula]

which directly induces the functional relations in the homogeneous limit [\cite=Cao1]

[formula]

XXZ spin-[formula] chain with arbitrary boundary fields

The XXZ spin-[formula] chain with arbitrary boundary fields is described by the Hamiltonian

[formula]

where 6 boundary parameters α±, β± and θ± are related to the boundary fields. The corresponding transfer matrix is given by

[formula]

where the other one-row monodronomy matrix (c.f. ([\ref=Mon-1])) is given by

[formula]

and the K-matrices are given by [\cite=de1] [\cite=GZ]

[formula]

and

[formula]

It was shown in [\cite=Cao1] that for generic {θj} the transfer matrix given by ([\ref=Transfer-open]) for arbitrary boundary parameters satisfies the following properties

[formula]

where the functions ā(u) and (u) are given by [\cite=Cao1]

[formula]

The above operator relations lead to that the corresponding eigenvalue, denoted by Λ(u), of the transfer matrix enjoys the following properties

[formula]

In addition, the operator product identities in the homogeneous limit (i.e. θj  →  0) reads

[formula]

which directly induces the functional relations in the homogeneous limit

[formula]

Complete characterization of the spectrum

We first show that each eigenvalue of the transfer matrix (the solution of ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Anti-3]) for antiperiodic boundary condition or the solution of ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-6-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Anal-6]) for the open boundary condition respectively) can be expressed in terms of some inhomogeneous T - Q relation proposed in [\cite=Cao1].

Each solution of ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Anti-3]) can be parameterized in terms of the following inhomogeneous T - Q relation

[formula]

with Q(u) being a trigonometric polynomial of the following type

[formula]

and

[formula]

The N parameters {λj} satisfy the associated Bethe ansatz equations (BAEs)

[formula]

Proof. Let us introduce a function f(u) which is equal to the difference between the LHS and the RHS of ([\ref=T-Q-relation]), namely,

[formula]

The relations ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-2]) and ([\ref=Q-function])-([\ref=c-function]) allow us to derive that f(u) satisfies the following properties

[formula]

This implies that the function f(u) is fixed by its values at any 2N different points. For each solution of ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Anti-3]), one can always choose a Q(u) of form ([\ref=Q-function]) such that

[formula]

which means f(u) = 0 or ([\ref=T-Q-relation]) is fulfilled. The above 2N equations can be rewritten in terms of the following N two-components equations

[formula]

The conditions that the above N equations have non-trivial solutions is exact ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-1]). This means that if Λ(u) is a solution of ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Anti-3]), the 2N equations ([\ref=Eq-1]) and ([\ref=Eq-2]) are equivalent to the following N equations

[formula]

which allow us to determine the Q(u) function in the form of ([\ref=Q-function]) by its values at the N points θj. Therefore, we are always able to choose the Q(u) of form ([\ref=Q-function]) from ([\ref=Eq-3]) such that f(u) = 0 provided that Λ(u) is an eigenvalue of the transfer matrix ([\ref=anti-Transfer]). Taking u at the roots of the Q(u) function (i.e., {λj}), the condition f(λj) = 0 gives rise to the associated BAEs ([\ref=BAE]), which also completely determines the Q(u) function. This completes the proof. [formula]

Similarly, we can prove that

Each solution of ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-6-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Anal-6]) can be parameterized in terms of the following inhomogeneous T - Q relation

[formula]

with Q(u) being a trigonometric polynomial of the following type

[formula]

and the constant c being given by

[formula]

The N parameters {λj} satisfy the associated BAEs

[formula]

The rational limit of this corollary was also verified [\cite=Nep13-1] by numerical checks for some small sites of lattice.

The relations ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Anti-3]) completely characterize the spectrum of the transfer matrix given by ([\ref=anti-Transfer]) for the inhomogeneous XXZ spin-[formula] chain with anti-periodic boundary condition.

Proof. We note that each solution of ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Anti-3]) can be parameterized in terms of an inhomogeneous T - Q relation. With such solution as an eigenvalue, a corresponding eigenstate of the transfer matrix can be retrieved no matter with or without inhomogeneity [\cite=sigma] [\cite=Cao14-state]. In such sense, all the solutions of ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Anti-3]) must belong to the set of eigenvalues of the transfer matrix. [formula]

Similarly, we have

For the homogenous XXZ spin-[formula] chain with antiperiodic boundary condition, the spectrum of the transfer matrix are completely determined by the equations ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Anti-4])-([\ref=Eigen-Anti-6]).

The relations ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-6-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Anal-6]) completely characterize the spectrum of the transfer matrix given by ([\ref=Transfer-open]) for the inhomogeneous XXZ spin-[formula] open chain with the most generic non-diagonal K-matrices specified by ([\ref=K-matrix]) and ([\ref=K-6-2]).

For the homogenous XXZ spin-[formula] open chain with the most generic non-diagonal K-matrices specified by ([\ref=K-matrix]) and ([\ref=K-6-2]), the spectrum of the transfer matrix is completely determined by the equations ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-Hom-6-1])-([\ref=Eigen-Anal-Hom-6]).

The above statements are due to the fact that for each inhomogeneous T - Q relation a corresponding eigenstate of the transfer matrix can be constructed via the method in [\cite=Cao14-state] [\cite=Bel14] and [\cite=CLSW]. Actually there exist an infinite number of possible parameterizations [\cite=Cao1] to the eigenvalue function, but they are all equivalent to each other because of Theorem 1. The corresponding Bethe states for each of these different parameterizations were constructed [\cite=sigma] [\cite=Cao14-state] [\cite=Bel14]. The degree of the Q-polynomial may be reduced to a small value for c = 0. In this case the T - Q relation becomes a homogeneous one and part of the N Bethe roots may take the value of infinity. This happens in cases of the U(1) symmetry or in the degenerate cases of the open spin chain[\cite=CLSW], where the transfer matrix can be diagonalized in smaller blocks. We emphasize that complete-spectrum characterization does not mean complete-eigenstate characterization because in some cases the eigenstates may be degenerate.

Results for the XXZ spin-s open chain

For the XXZ spin-s chain [\cite=Zam80] [\cite=fusion] [\cite=MNR] ([formula]), the quantum space of each site is 2s + 1-dimensional and endows the spin-s representation of Uq(sl2) with q = eη [\cite=Cha94]. The fundamental spin-[formula] R-matrix is given by [\cite=fusion]

[formula]

where S3,  S ±  are the spin-s realizations of the quantum algebra Uq(sl2). The fundamental transfer matrix denoted by [formula], is given by (c.f. ([\ref=Transfer-open]))

[formula]

where the two monodromy matrices are given by

[formula]

and the corresponding K-matrices are given by ([\ref=K-matrix]) and ([\ref=K-6-2]) respectively. The transfer matrix and its fused ones (for the details we refer to [\cite=Nep04]), denoted by t(j,s)(u), satisfy the following fusion hierarchy relation [\cite=fusion2] [\cite=Fra07]

[formula]

where we have used the convention t(0,s)  =  id and the coefficient function δ(s)(u) related to the quantum determinant is given by

[formula]

The fused transfer matrices t(j,s)(u), which are commutative each other, can be constructed by the fused R-matrices and K-matrices [\cite=fusion] [\cite=MNR] [\cite=fusion2] [\cite=Fra07]. Let us denote the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix t(j,s)(u) by Λ(j,s)(u). The commutativity of the transfer matrices and the operator relations ([\ref=Hier-Op-s]) imply that the eigenvalues also obey the same fusion hierarchy relation

[formula]

Following the method developed in [\cite=Cao14] [\cite=Hao14], we can obtain some operator identities between [formula] and t(s,s)(u) at some special points, which leads to the following relation between their eigenvalues

[formula]

Moreover, it is easy to verify that [formula] satisfy the following relations

[formula]

The equations ([\ref=Eigenvalue-crossing-s]), ([\ref=Eigenvalue-Asy-s])-([\ref=Eigenvalue-Anal-s]) allow us to express [formula] uniquely in terms of N + 3 unknown coefficients [formula] as follow

[formula]

The hierarchy relation ([\ref=Hier-Eigen-s]) implies that Λ(s,s)(u), as a function of [formula], is a polynomial of degree 2s. Then each equation of ([\ref=Eigen-Identity-s]), with respect to [formula], is of degree 2s + 1. Noting the fact that the dimension of the Hilbert space of the spin-s chain is (2s + 1)N, with similar analysis for the spin-[formula] case we can show that the equations ([\ref=Hier-Eigen-s])-([\ref=Eigenvalue-Anal-s]) completely characterize the spectrum of the transfer matrix [formula], and that each eigenvalue [formula] of the transfer matrix [formula] can be parameterized by the following inhomogeneous T - Q relation

[formula]

where the function F(s)(u) and the constant c(s) are given by

[formula]

The function Q(u) is parameterized by 2sN Bethe roots [formula] as

[formula]

which should satisfy the following BAEs

[formula]

Conclusions

The complete-spectrum characterization of quantum integrable spin chains via ODBA is studied. Taking the XXZ spin chains as examples, we have shown that the ODBA functional relations completely characterize the spectrum of the transfer matrix, since each solution of these functional relations can be parameterized in terms of some inhomogeneous T - Q relation, which allows us to construct a corresponding eigenstate of the transfer matrix with this solution as the eigenvalue. The inhomogeneous T - Q relation of type ([\ref=T-Q-relation]) ( see also ([\ref=T-Q-relation-2]) or ([\ref=T-Q-ansatz-s])), like the role of the Yang-Baxter equation, plays a unified and fundamental role to characterize the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of rank-1 quantum integrable models both with and without U(1) symmetry.
