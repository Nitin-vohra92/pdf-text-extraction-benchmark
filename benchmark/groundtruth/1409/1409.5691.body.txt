Abstract

Given a hyperbolic quadric of PG(5, 2), there are 28 points off this quadric and 56 lines skew to it. It is shown that the (286,563)-configuration formed by these points and lines is isomorphic to the combinatorial Grassmannian of type G2(8). It is also pointed out that a set of seven points of G2(8) whose labels share a mark corresponds to a Conwell heptad of PG(5, 2). Gradual removal of Conwell heptads from the (286,563)-configuration yields a nested sequence of binomial configurations identical with part of that found to be associated with Cayley-Dickson algebras (arXiv:1405.6888).

Keywords: Combinatorial Grassmannian -   Binary Klein Quadric -   Conwell Heptad

Let Q+(5,2) be a hyperbolic quadric in a five-dimensional projective space PG(5,2). As it is well known (see, e. g., [\cite=hir1] [\cite=hir2]), there are 28 points lying off this quadric as well as 56 lines skew (or, external) to it. If the equation of the quadric is taken in a canonical form x1x2  +  x3x4  +  x5x6  =  0, then the 28 off-quadric points are

and the 56 external lines read

In the latter table, the '+' symbol indicates which point lies on a given line; for example, line 1 consists of points 1, 4 and 9. As it is obvious from this table, each line has three points and through each point there are six lines; hence, these points and lines form a (286,563)-configuration.

Next, a combinatorial Grassmannian Gk(X) (see, e. g., [\cite=praz] [\cite=owpr]), where k is a positive integer and X is a finite set, |X|  =  N, is a point-line incidence structure whose points are k-element subsets of X and whose lines are (k  +  1)-element subsets of X, incidence being inclusion. Obviously, Gk(N) is a [formula]-configuration; hence, we have another (286,563)-configuration, G2(8).

It is straightforward to see that the two (286,563)-configurations are, in fact, isomorphic. To this end, one simply employs the following bijection between the 28 off-quadric points and the 28 points of G2(8) (here, by a slight abuse of notation, X  =  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8})

and verifies step by step that each of the above-listed 56 lines of PG(5, 2) is also a line of G2(8); thus, line 1 of PG(5, 2) corresponds to the line {1,4,6} of G2(8), line 2 to the line {1,2,4}, line 3 to {1,3,4}, etc.

This isomorphism entails a very interesting property related to so-called Conwell heptads [\cite=con]. Given a Q+(5,2) of PG(5, 2), a Conwell heptad is a set of seven off-quadric points such that each line joining two distinct points of the heptad is skew to the Q+(5,2). There are altogether eight such heptads: any two of them have a unique point in common and each of the 28 points off the quadric is contained in two heptads. The points in the first table are arranged in such a way that, as it is obvious from the bottom part of the second table, the last seven of them represent a Conwell heptad. From the last table we read off that this particular heptad corresponds to those seven points of G2(8) whose representatives have mark '8' in common. Clearly, the remaining seven heptads correspond to those septuples of points of G2(8) that share one of the remaining seven marks each. Finally, we observe that by removing from our off-quadric (286,563)-configuration the seven points of a Conwell heptad and all the 21 lines defined by pairs of them one gets a (215,353)-configuration isomorphic to G2(7); gradual removal of additional heptads and the corresponding lines yields the following nested sequence of configurations:

Remarkably, this nested sequence of binomial configurations is identical with part of that found to be associated with Cayley-Dickson algebras [\cite=cd].
