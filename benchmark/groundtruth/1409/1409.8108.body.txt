p-vanishing conjugacy classes of symmetric groups

Lucia Morotti

Introduction

Let p be a prime and n a non-negative integer. The work presented here started from the following question of Navarro to Olsson (December 2010):

"What are the elements x of the symmetric group Sn such that χ(x) = 0 for all [formula] of degree divisible by p?"

We start with some definitions.

We will say that a partition of n is p-vanishing if it labels a p-vanishing conjugacy class of Sn.

Let [formula] be the p-adic decomposition of n (with [formula]). We will also often fix some t  ≥  0 and write n = dtpt + et with dt  ≥  0 and 0  ≤  et < pt. This notation is now fix and will be used throughout the paper. Notice that, if t  ≤  k, then [formula] and that [formula] (while, if t > k, then dt = 0 and et = n).

In this definition, and throughout this paper, [formula] means that [formula] is a partition of ai. For example the partition [formula] is a partition of p-adic type. As 0  ≤  ai < p for 0  ≤  i  ≤  k we have that a partition α is of p-adic type if and only if

[formula]

for 0  ≤  i  ≤  k.

In [\cite=b5], Malle, Navarro and Olsson proved that λn,p is p-vanishing. For [formula] let χα be the irreducible character of Sn labeled by α and let χαβ be the value of χα on the conjugacy class labeled by β. In Theorem 1.4 of [\cite=m2] the following classification of p-singular irreducible characters for Sn was proved.

In this paper we will often use the equivalence of [\ref=i5] and [\ref=i4]. Also the following holds (Corollary 1.5 of [\cite=m2]).

Partitions of p-adic type are p-vanishing.

Going back to Navarro's question we can now ask: do there exist p-vanishing partitions which are not of p-adic type?

For p = 2 and p = 3 the answer to the above question is yes, even if p-vanishing partitions are quite close to being of p-adic type (they can only differ from partitions of p-adic type on their small parts), as can be seen in Theorem [\ref=t1]. For p  ≥  5 the author's conjecture is that there do not exist p-vanishing partitions which are not of p-adic type (Conjecture [\ref=c3]).

Notice that whenever [formula] is of p-adic type with ci > 0 and [formula] then [formula] is a partition of n, since ci  ≥  pr > ci + 1.

It is easy, for n < 8 if p = 2 or for n < 9 if p = 3, to find which partitions of n are p-vanishing, as this can be done by simply looking at the character table of Sn. For completeness we write such partitions in the following table, where partitions not of p-adic type are in bold.

For a prime p  ≥  5 we have the following conjectures.

If p  ≥  5, then a partition is p-vanishing if and only if it is of p-adic type.

Let p  ≥  5. Then for every n and any p-vanishing partition [formula] of n we have that

[formula]

Even if the second conjecture seems weaker than the first one, they turn out to be equivalent.

Some definitions and basic lemmas

In this section we will give some results which will be used later in proving Theorems [\ref=t1] and [\ref=t3]. For α is a partition and r is a positive integer we will write α(r) for the r-core of α, α(r) for the r-quotient of α and wr(α) for the r-weight of α. For definition and basic results about r-cores, r-quotients and r-weights see Section I.3 of [\cite=b4]. We will need the following result about partitions.

Let α and β be partitions and r,s  ≥  1. If β is obtained from α by removing an rs-hook then β can be obtained from α by removing r hooks of length s.

See Theorem 3.3 and Proposition 3.6 of [\cite=b4]. In particular the following holds.

Let α be a partition and r,s be positive integers. If β is obtained from α by removing an rs-hook, then we have that wr(β) = wr(α) - s.

By Corollary [\ref=c1] we have that bi(α) = wpi(α(pi + 1)), in particular bi(α)  ≥  0 and the following lemma holds.

If bi(α) are as in the Definition [\ref=d1], then we have that, for j  ≥  0,

[formula]

See Proposition 4.5 of [\cite=b5].

We have that χα is not p-singular if and only if bi(α) = ai for every i  ≥  0.

See Sections 3 and 4 of [\cite=m3]. The following is an easy corollary to the previous lemma.

If [formula] for some m  ≥  0, then χα is p-singular.

From Lemma [\ref=l'9] we have that in this case

[formula]

in particular there exists i with [formula] and so we can conclude by Lemma [\ref=l14].

Let t  ≥  0 and assume that n = dtpt + et with dt  ≥  1 and 0  ≤  et < pt. Let α be a partition of n with α1  >  α2  ≥  1 and such that

[formula]

Then χα is p-singular.

From Corollary [\ref=c7] it is enough to show that wpt(α) < dt.

As hα1,α2 + 1 > (dt - 1)pt and hα2,1 < pt we can remove from α a sequence of (dt - 1) hooks of length pt in a unique way obtaining [formula] for some m > α2 (we use that lα1,α2 + 1 = 0). As

[formula]

we can not remove from β any further hook of length pt. In particular wpt(α) = dt - 1 and so the corollary follows.

In particular the following corollary holds.

Let t  ≥  0 and assume that [formula] and α = (c,1n - c), with et  ≤  n - c < pt. Then χα is p-singular.

As

[formula]

the corollary follows from Corollary [\ref=l4].

We will now give an additional equivalent condition for χα to be p-singular.

Let [formula]. Then χα is p-singular if and only if α is of class m for some m  ≥  0.

This follows easily from Theorem [\ref=c5], as, if α is of class m for some m  ≥  0, then it is also of class 0.

Proof of Theorems [\ref=t1] and [\ref=t3]

We will now classify p-vanishing conjugacy classes for p = 2 and p = 3, proving Theorem [\ref=t1], and for p  ≥  5 prove Theorem [\ref=t3]. Some theorems appearing in this section will be proved in later sections, as their proofs are quite long.

The next theorem states that, if [formula] is p-vanishing and [formula], then, under certain conditions, ci is divisible by pt whenever ci  ≥  pt.

The proof of this theorem can be found in Section [\ref=s1].

For p = 2 and p = 3 we will prove in the next two theorems that there exist some [formula] such that [formula] for t  ≥  m and for [formula] a p-vanishing partition. For p  ≥  5 we will prove in the next theorem that [formula] for every t  ≥  0.

For a proof see Section [\ref=s2].

For the proof of this theorem see Section [\ref=s3] (in Section [\ref=s4] we will prove a theorem used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=t19]).

We will now show how characters can be evaluated on certain elements of Sn containing cycles of length divisible by a fixed r  ≥  1.

It can be easily shown that [formula] is well defined, that is it does not depend on the order in which the parts of λ are removed. It can also be proved by simply applying the formula for induced characters that

[formula]

In the following δr(α) will denote the r-sign of α.

Let α be a partition of n. Let [formula] and [formula]. Also let π∈Srwr(α) with cycle partition [formula] and [formula] with cycle partition λ. Then

[formula]

See 4.58 of [\cite=r1].

We still need one theorem before being able to prove Theorem [\ref=t1].

The theorem clearly holds if m > k. So we can assume that m  ≤  k.

Notice that by assumption

[formula]

By definition of l it then follows that pt|ci for i  ≤  l.

By assumption we have that, for m  ≤  t < k,

[formula]

Also, again by assumption,

[formula]

So by Lemma [\ref=l1] and the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula, if [formula] we can remove from α a sequence of hooks with lengths [formula].

First assume that [formula] is p-vanishing. Let [formula] with p| deg (χα) and r  ≤  k maximal such that α is of class r. Notice that such an r exists by Lemma [\ref=l22]. If r  ≥  m, then we cannot remove from α a sequence of hooks with lengths [formula] by the previous part of the proof and so in this case [formula]. Assume now that α is of class r but not of class m for some r < m. Then, by Lemma [\ref=l1] and the remark at the beginning of the proof, if β is obtained from α by removing a sequence of hooks of lengths [formula] we have that β  =  α(pm) (as such a β satisfies |β| < pm and is obtained from α by removing hooks of lengths divisible by pm). As α is not of class m we then have that α(pm) can be obtained from α by removing a sequence of hooks of lengths [formula]. As [formula] it follows that α(pm) is of class r (as α is of class r but not of class m) and so, in particular, we have by Lemma [\ref=l22] that p| deg (χα(pm)). As [formula] is p-vanishing, it then follows from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula and Lemma [\ref=l3] that, for some [formula],

[formula]

So, if [formula] is p-vanishing, then [formula] is also p-vanishing.

Assume now that [formula] is p-vanishing. Let [formula] with p| deg (χβ) and define [formula]. As |β| < pm and by assumption [formula] so that (1,β1 + 1)∈[α] and then

[formula]

we can remove from α a sequence of hooks with lengths [formula] in a unique way obtaining β. As p| deg (χβ) and the p-adic decomposition of |β| is [formula], we have by Theorem [\ref=c5] applied to both α and β that p divides the degree of χα. So, again as |β| < pm, [formula] and lα1,β1 + 1 = 0, by definition of l and as [formula] is p-vanishing, we have by the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula that

[formula]

and as this holds for each [formula] with p| deg (χβ), we have that [formula] is p-vanishing.

We are now ready to prove Theorem [\ref=t1].

Let notation be as in the statement of Theorem [\ref=t1] and let l be maximal such that cl  ≥  pr. Then by Theorems [\ref=t17] and [\ref=t19] we have that

[formula]

for t  ≥  r. In particular by Theorem [\ref=t15]

[formula]

for t  ≥  r. So we can apply Theorem [\ref=t20] and we obtain that [formula] is p-vanishing. As [formula] we also have that [formula]. Also from Equations [\eqref=eq7] and [\eqref=eq8],

[formula]

for t  ≥  r and so [formula] is of p-adic type.

The other direction follows easily by Theorem [\ref=t20].

We will use the following lemma in the proof of Theorem [\ref=t3].

Let t  ≥  0 and assume that [formula] is p-vanishing. If [formula] then [formula].

Assume that for some [formula] we have that n - dtpt  ≤  cj < pt and [formula]. Let α: = (n - cj,1cj). Then χα has degree divisible by p by Corollary [\ref=l16]. Also as hα2,1 = cj when removing any sequence of hooks of lengths [formula] from α we need to remove all hooks of length > cj from the first row. Let s be minimal such that cs = cj. Notice that s  ≤  j. Since

[formula]

and lα1,2 = 0 we can remove in a unique way the first s - 1 hooks of the sequence and obtain the partition ((j - s)cj + f,1cj), where [formula]. Since 1  ≤  f  ≤  cj from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula we have that, for l  ≥  1,

[formula]

and so by induction on l we have that [formula]. In particular [formula] and so [formula] is not p-vanishing.

If [formula] and

[formula]

then we have that [formula] has at least one part of length between et and pt - 1. Let l be maximal such that et  ≤  cl  ≤  pt - 1. If l < h, then we can conclude by the previous part with j = l that [formula] is not p-vanishing in this case.

So assume now that l = h. If ch > et then let β: = (n - ch + 1,1ch - 1). From Corollary [\ref=l16] it follows that p| deg (χβ). Also from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula we easily have that

[formula]

and so [formula] is not p-vanishing. If ch = et, then we have that h  ≥  2 and ch - 1 < pt, since [formula]. So we can conclude from the first part of the proof with j = h - 1 that [formula] is not p-vanishing in this case either and then the lemma follows.

We will now prove Theorem [\ref=t3], which states the equivalence of Conjectures [\ref=c3] and [\ref=c4].

It is clear that Conjecture [\ref=c3] would imply Conjecture [\ref=c4], so we only need to prove the other direction.

We already know from Corollary [\ref=t12] that if a partition is of p-adic type then it is p-vanishing. So assume now that [formula] is p-vanishing. Let t  ≥  1. We can write

[formula]

Assume that

[formula]

(notice that this condition holds for t = 1, as then pt - 1 = 1). We will prove that under this assumption, if Conjecture [\ref=c4] holds, then

[formula]

From Theorems [\ref=t15] and [\ref=t17] and Equation [\eqref=eq1] we have that there exists l  ≥  0, such that

[formula]

with [formula] and cl + 1 < pt - 1. Let [formula] with p| deg (χβ) and let α be the partition with

[formula]

Notice that (et - 1) is a pt - 1-core since et - 1 < pt - 1. As the p-adic decomposition of dt - 1  =  ⌊n / pt - 1⌋ is [formula], we have by Theorem [\ref=c5] and Lemma [\ref=l1] that p| deg (χα). As [formula] is p-vanishing, applying Lemmas [\ref=l3] and [\ref=c6] we have that

[formula]

and so [formula]. As this holds for every [formula] with p| deg (χβ) it follows that [formula] is p-vanishing. As dt - 1 = dtp + at - 1 and we are assuming that Conjecture [\ref=c4] holds we have that [formula]. From Lemma [\ref=l23] applied to n' = dt - 1 = dtp + at - 1, t' = 1 and [formula] it then follows that [formula]. So Equation [\eqref=eq2] follows from Equation [\eqref=eq3].

By induction and Theorem [\ref=t17] we have that

[formula]

for each t  ≥  0. So, by Theorem [\ref=t15] we have that, for t  ≥  0,

[formula]

and then [formula] is of p-adic type.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t15]

We restate here Theorem [\ref=t15] and then prove it.

Let t  ≥  0 and [formula] be p-vanishing with ch > 0. If [formula] then cj is a multiple of pt whenever cj  ≥  pt.

If dt = 0, then the theorem clearly holds, as then n < pt and so in this case all part of [formula] are smaller than pt. So we can assume that dt > 0. Also we can assume that pt > 1.

Let [formula] and assume that m = dtpt and that there exists j for which cj  ≥  pt but cj is not a multiple of pt. We will show that in this case [formula] is not p-vanishing, giving a contradiction with the assumptions. Let l be maximal such that cl  ≥  pt and [formula]. Since pt|m, [formula] and cl  ≥  pt there must exists by definition of l and m some 1  ≤  l' < l with [formula]. Since cl'  ≥  cl as [formula] is a partition it follows that dtpt = m  ≥  cl' + cl  ≥  2cl. Also let s  ≥  1 minimal such that cs = cl. Write cl = cpt + f with 1  ≤  f < pt. By definition of l and since m = dtpt it follows that [formula]. The proof of this theorem will be divided in the following cases:

et = 0,

et > 0 and et  ≤  f < pt,

et > 0 and 1  ≤  f < et.

These three cases cover all possibilities, since by assumption [formula]. We will now study in turn the above cases, by showing that in each one of them we get a contradiction with [formula] being p-vanishing.

In this case let α: = (n - cl,2,1cl - 2). This is a partition of n since n  ≥  2cl and cl > pt. We will first show that p| deg (χα). In order to do this we will first show that wpt(α) < dt and since et = 0 to prove this it is enough to prove that the pt-core is not equal to (0). Notice that since et = 0 and cl = cpt + f we have that [formula]. Also 1  ≤  pt - f < pt. From the definition of α it follows that

[formula]

If 1 = f = pt - 1, then pt = 2 and α(2) = (3,2,1)(2) = (3,2,1). In particular in this case wpt(α) < dt. Also since pt > 1,

[formula]

and (pt - 1,2,1pt - 1) and (pt + 1,2,1pt - 3) are conjugate to each other, it follows that wpt(α) < dt also in the other cases. It then follows from Corollary [\ref=c7] that p| deg (χα).

We will now show that [formula], which will give a contradiction with the assumption of [formula] being p-vanishing. Notice that in this case pt|r. Assume first that l < h. Then r  ≥  pt  ≥  2 and

[formula]

(the last equation holding only if r  ≥  3). So, from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula,

[formula]

where δx  ≥  y = 1 if x  ≥  y and δx  ≥  y = 0 otherwise. Since [formula] it follows that, if r  ≥  cl + 2, then [formula] and so, since pt|r we have that wpt((r - cl,2,1cl - 2)) < r / pt. Also since in this case m = n we have that cj  ≥  pt for j  ≤  h and then by maximality of l that pt|cj for l < j  ≤  h. From repeated application of Corollary [\ref=c1] it then follows that [formula]. In particular, since s  ≤  l, if l < h we have that [formula].

Assume now that l = h. First assume that s = l. Then since cj > cl for 1  ≤  j < l we have from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula that

[formula]

If s < l, since cj = cl for s  ≤  j  ≤  l and since cl > 1, then

[formula]

As p| deg (χα) and [formula] we have a contradiction.

In this case let α: = (n - cl,1cl). Notice that α is a partition of n and that (1,2)∈[α] since n  ≥  m  ≥  2cl and cl > pt. We will first show that p| deg (χα). Let [formula] with 0  ≤  g < pt. By definition [formula] and 1  ≤  f < pt. So α(pt) = (g + 1,1f)(pt). Since

[formula]

and 0  ≤  f,g < pt it follows that α(pt) = (g + 1,1f) and by assumption that

[formula]

So h  ≥  1, that is f + g + 1 > et. In particular wpt(α) < dt and so it follows from Corollary [\ref=c7] that p| deg (χα).

We will now show that [formula]. Since et > 0 and m = dtpt = n - et, we have that 1  ≤  ch < pt and so l < h. Then r > 0 and so from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula it follows that

[formula]

Since l  ≥  s in order to prove that [formula] it is enough to prove that, if r > cl, then [formula]. So assume that r > cl. In particular r > pt. Since m = dtpt and by definition of l, if we let v be maximal such that cv  ≥  pt, then l < v < h and pt|cj for j  ≤  v. Also we can write r = wpt + et with w  ≥  1 and

[formula]

as [formula]. It is easy to see that

[formula]

since r - cl  ≥  1 and [formula]. Since f + g + 1 > et it follows that wpt((r - cl,1cl)) < w and then, from Corollary [\ref=c1], it follows that [formula] and so we have a contradiction.

Notice first that in this case et  ≥  2, since 1  ≤  f < et. In this case let α: = (n - cl,et,1cl - et). Since cl  ≥  pt > et  ≥  2 and

[formula]

we have that α is a partition of n. We will show that p divides the degree of χα and that [formula].

We will first prove that |α(pt)|  ≥  pt. It will then follow that wpt(α) < dt and so, from Corollary [\ref=c7], that the degree of χα is divisible by p. Write [formula] and [formula] with 0  ≤  g,h < pt. It is clear that

[formula]

Since [formula] and 1  ≤  f < et < pt we have that

[formula]

and

[formula]

As 0  ≤  pt - f,pt + f - et < pt it then follows by assumption of f and et that g = pt - f and h = pt + f - et. So

[formula]

Let β: = (pt - f + et,et,1pt + f - et). As 1  ≤  f < et < pt we have that (2,2),(3,1)∈[β]. Also

[formula]

So

[formula]

and then wpt(β) = |A|  ≤  1. In particular

[formula]

and then p| deg (χα).

We will now prove that [formula]. First notice that by the first part of the proof of the theorem,

[formula]

in particular (1,et + 1)∈[α]. As

[formula]

and as

[formula]

by definition of s, we have from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula that

[formula]

where [formula]. Since

[formula]

when removing from γ a sequence of (l - s) hooks of length cl we can either remove all of them from the first row, or remove once the hook corresponding to the node (2,1) and all other hooks from the first row. So

[formula]

Let [formula] and let v be maximal with cv  ≥  pt. Since

[formula]

when removing from δ a sequence of hooks of lengths [formula] we can either remove all of them from the first row, obtaining ε: = (e2t,1cl - et), which is always possible in a unique way, or we can remove some of them from the rows below the first one and all the other from the first one. As hδ2,2 = et - 1 < pt and as pt|cj for l + 1  ≤  j  ≤  v, if we remove some of such hooks from rows below the first one, then such hooks are removed from the first column and we obtain the partition λ: = (et + wpt,et,1cl - et - wpt) for some w  ≥  1 with cl - et - wpt  ≥  0. By assumptions on cl and et we have that w < c. We have

[formula]

in particular λ does not have any cl hook. Since et < cl, using the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula it then follows that

[formula]

This gives a contradiction to [formula] being p-vanishing by assumption.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t17]

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=t17] we will prove the following stronger version of it.

If dt = 0, then n < pt and so the theorem clearly holds. So we will now assume that dt > 0. The proof of the theorem will be divided in the following cases. In most of the cases we will assume that [formula] and prove that then [formula] is not p-vanishing. For the rest of the proof let [formula].

m  ≤  dtpt.

[formula] and m = n.

[formula] and dtpt < m < n.

[formula], dtpt < m < n and n - m > m - dtpt.

[formula], dtpt < m < n and n - m < m - dtpt.

3  ≤  et = pt - 1, dtpt < m < n and n - m = m - dtpt.

[formula], dtpt < m < n and n - m = m - dtpt.

These cases cover all possibilities, since, if et = 0, then m  ≤  n = dtpt. We will now study each case in turn.

In this case the theorem clearly holds.

Let α: = (dtpt,1et). Then p| deg (χα) by Corollary [\ref=l16]. As hα2,1 = et < pt and ch  ≥  pt as m = n, we have that

[formula]

and so [formula] is not p-vanishing in this case.

In this case let α: = (dtpt - 1,n - m + 1,1m - dtpt). As dtpt < m < n, as dt  ≥  1 and as et  ≤  pt - 2 by assumption we have that

[formula]

It then follows that α is a partition of n. Since

[formula]

and

[formula]

if (i,j) is a node of α and pt|hαi,j, then i = 1 and j  ≥  2. As hα1,2 = dtpt - 1 there exist at most dt - 1 such nodes (i,j) and so wpt(α) < dt. From Corollary [\ref=c7] it follows that p| deg (χα).

We have already proved that α2  <  α1. So (1,α2 + 1) = (1,n - m + 2) is a node of α. Let l be maximal such that cl  ≥  pt. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

As hα2,1 < pt and

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

and so [formula] is not p-vanishing in this case.

Let now α: = (dtpt + 1,2m - dtpt,1n - 2m + dtpt - 1). Since by assumption dt > 0 and n - m > m - dtpt > 0 we have that α is a partition of n. Also since dtpt < m < n we have that et  ≥  2 and so pt  ≥  3. In particular α1  ≥  4 > 2 = α2. As

[formula]

it follows from Corollary [\ref=l4] that p| deg (χα).

Let l be maximal such that cl  ≥  pt. From hα2,1 < pt it also follows that whenever we recursively remove from α hooks of lengths [formula] then all removed hooks correspond to a node on the first row of the respective partition. Also

[formula]

and

[formula]

So it easily follows from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula that

[formula]

and then [formula] is not p-vanishing.

In this case let α: = (dtpt + 1,2n - m,12m - n - dtpt - 1). Since by assumption 0 < n - m < m - dtpt and dt  ≥  1 we have that α is a partition of n. Further as pt = et + 1  ≥  2 we have that α1  ≥  3 > 2 = α2. As

[formula]

we have that p divides the degree of χα from Corollary [\ref=l4].

Again let l be maximal such that cl  ≥  pt. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

and so

[formula]

In particular also in this case [formula] is not p-vanishing.

Notice that

[formula]

is even and so by assumption et  ≥  4. As pt = et + 1 we also have that t  ≥  1 and p is odd. Let α: = (dtpt,2et / 2). Since et = pt - 1  ≥  4 we have that (1,3)∈[α] and

[formula]

and so p| deg (χα) by Corollary [\ref=l4]. Let l be maximal such that cl  ≥  pt. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

So it follows easily from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula that

[formula]

In particular [formula] is not p-vanishing.

Also in this case we have that et is even, since et = n - dtpt = 2(n - m). So by assumption pt - 1 = et = 2 and then p = 3, t = 1 and

[formula]

which is the exceptional case in the theorem.

An additional theorem

The theorem proved in this section is needed in order to prove Theorem [\ref=t19]. Since its proof is quite long we write it in a separate section.

Assume that pt|n and that α is a partition of n. If α has a β-set [formula] with m  ≥  1 and [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, then p| deg (χα).

From Corollary [\ref=c7] and since n = dtpt in this case it is enough to prove that [formula]. Since [formula] is a β-set for α, there exist li for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m such that [formula] is a β-set for α(pt). By assumption no element of X is divisible by pt, in particular [formula]. Since |X| = m  ≥  1 we have that [formula].

The next theorem states that almost always the smallest part of a p-vanishing partition is at least as large as the largest power of p dividing n.

The theorem is trivial if pt  ≤  2. So assume that pt  ≥  3. Also for n  ≤  3 the theorem is easy to prove by looking at the corresponding character table, so we will now assume that n  ≥  4.

Assume now that [formula] is a partition of n with 1  ≤  ch < pt and such that [formula] is not in one of the special cases for pt∈{3,4}. We will prove that then [formula] is not p-vanishing. The proof will be divided in the following cases:

2  ≤  ch < pt.

pt  ≥  4 and [formula] ends by (1,1,1,1), (2,1,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,2,1,1), (g,1) or (g,1,1) with g  ≥  3.

pt  ≥  4, [formula] ends by (3,2,1,1) or (g,1,1,1) with g  ≥  3 but [formula] and it doesn't end by (l,3,3,1,1,1).

pt  ≥  4 and [formula] ends by (g,2,1) with g  ≥  3.

pt  ≥  5, [formula] or it ends by (g,3,3,1,1,1) or (g,2,1,1) with g  ≥  4, but [formula] and it doesn't end by (l,4,2,1,1) with l  ≥  5.

pt  ≥  5 and [formula] or ends by (g,4,2,1,1) with g  ≥  5.

pt = 4 and [formula] or it ends by (g,3,3,1,1,1) with g  ≥  4.

It can be easily checked that these cases cover all possibilities where ch < pt and which are not between the special cases listed for pt∈{3,4}. We will now study each case in turn.

Let α: = (n - ch,ch). From ch < pt and pt|n we have that h  ≥  2. So n  ≥  ch - 1 + ch  ≥  2ch and then α is a partition.

From 2  ≤  ch < pt it follows that pt divides neither ch nor n - ch + 1. As {ch,n - ch + 1} is a β-set for α we have from Lemma [\ref=l5] that p| deg (χα).

We will now show that [formula]. Let s be minimal with cs = ch. First assume that s = h. Then

[formula]

and, since

[formula]

we have that

[formula]

Assume now that s < h. In this case

[formula]

if (1,ch + 1)∈[α], that is h  ≥  3 (if h = 2 then s = 1, so that the following also holds). So

[formula]

In particular in either case [formula] and so [formula] is not p-vanishing.

Write [formula], with β a partition of the form (1,1,1,1), (2,1,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,2,1,1), (g,1) or (g,1,1) with g  ≥  3. In this case let α: = (n - 2,2). Since n  ≥  4 it follows that α is a partition. Also from [formula] we have from Lemma [\ref=l5] that p| deg (χα). We will now prove that [formula] if [formula] ends by (1,1,1,1), (2,1,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,2,1,1), (g,1) or (g,1,1) with g  ≥  3. As

[formula]

(the last one only if (1,3)∈[α], that is n  ≥  5), it follows from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula that

[formula]

For β∈{(1,1,1,1),(2,1,1,1),(2,2,1),(2,2,1,1)} it is easily checked that [formula]. Also, for g  ≥  3, we have that

[formula]

So [formula] and then [formula] is not p-vanishing.

In this case write [formula] with cs  ≥  4 or [formula], where β = (β1,β2,β3)∈{(2,1,1),(1,1,1)}. Since by assumption n  ≥  6 we have that α is a partition. Also since [formula] since pt  ≥  4 we have from Lemma [\ref=l5] that p| deg (χα).

First assume that w = 0. Then [formula] with s  ≥  1 by assumption. Since h(n - 3,3)2,1 = 3 < cs and cs + 3 > 6 it follows from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula that

[formula]

Assume now that w  ≥  1. Notice that |β|  ≥  3. Then

[formula]

Since by assumption [formula] if β = (1,1,1) also in this case [formula].

In particular we again have that [formula] is not p-vanishing.

Write now [formula] with cs  ≥  4 or [formula]. In this case let α: = (n - 4,2,2). Since |α|  ≥  g + 3  ≥  6 it follows that α is a partition. Also as {n - 2,3,2} is a β-set for α and pt  ≥  4 we have from Lemma [\ref=l5] that p| deg (χα).

Assume first that w = 0. Then [formula] with s  ≥  1. In particular n  ≥  cs + 3  ≥  7, so that (1,3)∈[α] and then

[formula]

So

[formula]

Assume now that w  ≥  1. As above

[formula]

So [formula] and then [formula] is not p-vanishing.

In this case write [formula] with cs  ≥  5 or [formula], where β∈{(3,3,1,1,1),(2,1,1)}. Also let α: = (n - 4,4). By assumption n  ≥  8, so that α is a partition. Also since pt  ≥  5, so that [formula], we have from Lemma [\ref=l5] that p| deg (χα).

Assume first that β = (3,3,1,1,1). Since [formula] and hα2,1 = 4, it follows from the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula that

[formula]

Assume next that β = (2,1,1) and that w  ≥  1. Then w  ≥  2 by assumption. Also in this case [formula] and so, similarly to before,

[formula]

At last assume that β = (2,1,1) and w = 0. Then [formula] with s  ≥  1. As [formula] and cs > 4 we have that

[formula]

It follows that [formula] is not p-vanishing in each of the above cases.

Write now [formula] with cs  ≥  5 or [formula].

If [formula] then n = 8 and so pt = 8, since 5  ≤  pt|n. Since deg (χ(3,3,2)) = 42 and χ(3,3,2)(4,2,1,1) =  - 2 it follows that (4,2,1,1) is not 2-vanishing.

So assume now that [formula] with s  ≥  1. In this case let α: = (n - 5,3,2). By assumption n > 8, so that α is a partition. Also since pt  ≥  5, so that [formula], we have from Lemma [\ref=l5] that p| deg (χα).

Since n > 8, so that (1,4)∈[α] and

[formula]

we have that

[formula]

and then also in this case [formula] is not p-vanishing.

The case [formula] cannot happen, since pt = 4. Write [formula] with s = 0 or cs  ≥  7. By assumption s + w + x + y  ≥  1. Let α: = (n - 6,3,1,1,1). From n > 9 it follows that α is a partition. Using the hook formula we have that

[formula]

From 4 = pt|n it follows that 2| deg (χα).

Since n > 9 we also have that (1,4)∈[α]. So

[formula]

and then

[formula]

In particular [formula] is not 2-vanishing.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t19]

The next theorem is stronger than Theorem [\ref=t19] and so proving it will also prove Theorem [\ref=t19].

Notice that the theorem clearly holds for t = 0, as in this case pt = 1. So we will assume that t  ≥  1. The theorem also clearly holds if dt = 0. So we will assume that [formula]. Let [formula] be p-vanishing. We will prove that then [formula] if we are in one of the cases above. Using Lemma [\ref=l23] it will be enough to prove that [formula].

The proof of the theorem will be divided in the following cases:

t  ≥  2 if p = 3 and [formula] or t  ≥  1 otherwise, [formula] and the theorem holds for t - 1.

8|n if p = 2 or 9|n if n = 3 and pt|n.

p = 2, [formula] and t = 3.

p = 2, [formula] and t = 2 or p = 3, [formula] and t = 1.

p = 3, [formula] and t = 2.

p = 3, [formula] and t = 2.

We will now prove the result in each of the above cases.

We can write n = dtpt + at - 1pt - 1 + et - 1. By assumption on t - 1 and by Theorem [\ref=t17] we have that

[formula]

and so, from Theorem [\ref=t15], that, for some l  ≥  0,

[formula]

with [formula] and cl + 1 < pt - 1. Notice that [formula] is a partition of et - 1. Proving that [formula] is then equivalent to proving that

[formula]

which in turn is equivalent to

[formula]

from Equation [\eqref=eq5]. Since

[formula]

it is enough to prove that

[formula]

This clearly holds if at - 1 = 0. So we can assume that at - 1 > 0. Let α be the partition with

[formula]

Then [formula]. From Lemma [\ref=l22] and Corollary [\ref=l16] applied to both α and (dtp,1at - 1) we have that p| deg (χα). By assumption and from Lemma [\ref=l3] we have that

[formula]

Notice that by assumption 1  ≤  at - 1  ≤  2, since 1  ≤  at - 1 < p  ≤  3.

Assume first that at - 1 = 1. Then

[formula]

and so

[formula]

since [formula] for x  ≥  2 (see 2.3.16 of [\cite=b1]).

Assume now that at - 1 = 2 and that [formula]. We will show that this give a contradiction. Write

[formula]

with m = 0 or fm  ≥  3. Then, since by assumption 2g + h  ≥  3,

[formula]

In particular h  ≥  3 since 2g + h  ≥  3. Let β be given by

[formula]

Then [formula] (in this case p = 3 and t - 1  ≥  2, so that pt - 1 > 1). Since we cannot remove dt hooks of length p from β(pt - 1) (there are only dt - 1 nodes of β(pt - 1) with hook length divisible by p) we have from Lemmas [\ref=l22] and [\ref=l1] that p| deg (χβ). From Lemma [\ref=l3] we then have that

[formula]

Since h  ≥  3 we have that

[formula]

which gives a contradiction. In particular 2g + h  ≤  2 and so the result is proved in this case too.

In these cases the theorem follows from Theorem [\ref=t13].

This case follows from Theorem [\ref=t13].

We will show that in this case [formula]. By assumption dt > 0, so that n > 2. As [formula] or [formula] we then have that n  ≥  6. In particular (n - 2,1,1), (n - 3,2,1) and (n - 3,1,1,1) are partitions. The degrees of χ(n - 2,1,1) and χ(n - 3,1,1,1) are divisible by p from Corollary [\ref=l16]. Using the hook formula it can be easily seen that the degree of χ(n - 3,2,1) is n(n - 2)(n - 4) / 3 and then it is divisible by p. Write [formula] with l = 0 or cl  ≥  4 and assume that x  ≥  3. Then, as [formula] is p-vanishing we have that

[formula]

So b = (a - 1)(a - 2) / 2  ≥  1 and then 2b + a  ≥  5. In particular

[formula]

and

[formula]

as

[formula]

As a  ≥  3 and as b = 1 if a = 3 and b = 3 if a = 4, we have that

[formula]

and then

[formula]

As [formula] is p-vanishing and p divides the degrees of χ(n - 3,1,1,1) and χ(n - 3,2,1), we have that c = a(a - 2)(a - 4) / 3 and that

[formula]

which gives a contradiction since we assumed that a  ≥  3. So [formula].

Assume now that p = 3, [formula] and t = 2. By assumption on dt it follows that n  ≥  14. In particular (n - 2,1,1), (n - 4,2,1,1), (n - 5,3,2), (n - 4,2,2), (n - 6,3,3), (n - 5,15), (n - 7,22,13) and (n - 7,2,15) are partitions.

If the result does not hold for t = 2, then we have from Case [\ref=i1] that the result does not hold for t = 1 either. In particular [formula] and then from Lemma [\ref=l23] we have that [formula]. So we can write [formula], with l = 0 or cl  ≥  5 and with a  ≥  3. As in the previous case we have from Corollary [\ref=l16] that 3 divides the degree of χ(n - 2,1,1) and that

[formula]

so that b = (a - 1)(a - 2) / 2.

From the hook formula we have that the degree of χ(n - 4,2,1,1) is

[formula]

and so it is divisible by 3. For a  ≥  4, we have that b  ≥  3 and then

[formula]

and as [formula] is 3-vanishing we have that

[formula]

For a  ≥  6 we have that

[formula]

since b = (a - 1)(a - 2) / 2. For 4  ≤  a  ≤  5 we have that

[formula]

Assume now that a = 3, so that b = 1. If d  ≥  1 then

[formula]

which brings a contradiction with [formula] by assumption.

So

[formula]

Let's now consider (n - 5,3,2). We have that the degree of χ(n - 5,3,2) is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 5)(n - 7) / 24, which is divisible by 3. If a  ≥  4 then a + 2b  ≥  10 and so, using Equation [\eqref=eq6], we have that

[formula]

Since b = (a - 1)(a - 2) / 2 for a  ≥  8 we have that

[formula]

For 4  ≤  a  ≤  7 we have that

[formula]

So, using the previous formulas for d,

[formula]

which gives a contradiction. So a = 3 and then b = 1 and d = 0, that is [formula], with cl  ≥  5.

Assume first that [formula]. Then

[formula]

If c  ≥  1 then

[formula]

which contradicts [formula] being 3-vanishing by assumption. So c = 0 and then [formula] in this case and then the result holds.

Assume now that [formula]. Then

[formula]

If c = 0 then

[formula]

which contradicts [formula] being 3-vanishing. If c  ≥  2 then

[formula]

which also contradicts [formula] being 3-vanishing. So c = 1 and we can write [formula] with l' = 0 or cl'  ≥  8.

Consider now (n - 5,15). The degree of the corresponding character is

[formula]

and so it is divisible by 3. Since [formula] is 3-vanishing we have that

[formula]

and so e = 0.

Next consider (n - 7,22,13). The corresponding character has degree

[formula]

which is divisible by 3, since [formula]. If f  ≥  1 then

[formula]

which contradicts [formula] being 3-vanishing. So f = 0.

At last consider (n - 7,2,15). The corresponding character has degree

[formula]

which is divisible by 3. If g  ≥  1 then

[formula]

which gives to a contradiction. So [formula] with cl'  ≥  8 (as n > 6 we have l' > 0) and then the result follows from Lemma [\ref=l23].

Assume now that p = 3, [formula] and t = 2. From dt > 0 we have that n  ≥  12, so that (n - 2,2), (n - 4,2,1,1), (n - 5,3,1,1) and (n - 6,2,2,2) are partitions of n. If [formula] we will show that [formula], while if [formula] that [formula].

Write [formula] with l = 0 or cl  ≥  3. From Case [\ref=i1], if the result does not hold for t = 2, then it can not hold for t = 1 either and then [formula]. From Theorem [\ref=t13] we then have that a  ≥  1.

From the hook formula we have that the degree of χ(n - 2,2) is n(n - 3) / 2 and so by assumption it is divisible by 3. If a + 2b  ≤  3, then l  ≥  1 and

[formula]

If instead a + 2b  ≥  4, then we have that

[formula]

As [formula] is 3-vanishing, so that [formula], we then have that (a,b)∈{(1,1),(2,1),(3,0)}. It also follows that l > 0, as n > 4  ≥  a + 2b.

Consider next (n - 4,2,1,1). From the hook formula we have that deg (χ(n - 4,2,1,1)) = n(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 5) / 8 and so it is divisible by 3. Write now [formula], with cl'  ≥  5. If d  ≥  1 then

[formula]

which gives a contradiction with [formula] being 3-vanishing. So d = 0. Assume now that a + 2b = 4 (and so (a,b) = (2,1)). Then

[formula]

which also gives a contradiction. So

[formula]

with a + 2b = 3 and l' = 0 or cl'  ≥  5. If [formula] we are done, due to Theorem [\ref=l23]. So assume now that [formula].

From the hooks formula we have that

[formula]

which is divisible by 3. Write [formula] with l'' = 0 or cl''  ≥  6. Since a + 2b = 3 if e  ≥  1, then

[formula]

which gives a contradiction. So [formula].

Consider now the partition (n - 6,2,2,2). We have that

[formula]

which is divisible by 3 since [formula]. Assume that c  ≥  2. Then

[formula]

which gives a contradiction with [formula] being 3-vanishing. In particular c  ≤  1, so [formula] and the result holds.
