* TODO
** Tasks with unclassified time period
*** DONE Pass receiver through to spatials calls, or construct receiver
    from method calls in spatials calls.
*** DONE Write methods to create spatial objects.
*** DONE Use show_text_with_positioning to construct text runs.
*** DONE Record spatial objects that result from spatials method calls.
*** DONE Complete the covert method - write spatial hashs out to xml.
*** DONE Write Spatial class with alter method.
** Small tasks, 10 minutes or so
*** DONE Improve inclusion of spatial object modules. Shouldn't need to 
    call, for example, include_text_runs.
*** DONE Pass set of previously constructed spatial objects to sptials calls,
    via a new method in parser - parser.previous :text_runs { ... }.
    Spatial objects such as margins depend on the positions of text
    runs.
*** DONE Determine units of and apply correctly :rise and :leading.
*** TODO Handle UserUnit transformations.
*** DONE Reset global text state at the end of each page.
*** DONE Position coords appear a bit above and to the right of where they
    should. Graphics state or page translation?
*** DONE Spaces appear one character before where they should in
    text_chunks.
*** DONE Apostrophes cause a chunk break.
*** DONE Split views into View, PdfView, PngView. Pass only explicit
    spatials in an easier form for Views. Move into lib/view.
*** DONE Move analysis modules into lib/analysis.
*** DONE Non-ascii chars that are transliterated are appearing in output one
    place before they should. Transliterated chars also cause a word
    break. Not getting their width correct in glyph width dict?
    ! Looks like this occurs for chars whose codes are in the font's
    @differences map.
*** DONE pdf_view.rb shouldn't call doc.go_to_page more than once per page.
    Causes objects to be rendered on the wrong page.
*** DONE pdf_view.rb should keep the same auto colour for object types on
    different pages.
*** DONE Some margins calculated with negative x or y. Because of characters
    incorrectly calculated to be out of the mediabox?
*** DONE Some characters don't get a correct width.
*** DONE Should merge with region above from right to left (or, in the
    opposite direction to writing direction). Causes last two lines of
    paragraphs to merge incorrectly.
*** DONE Figure out which state, and when (text object start/end, page
    start/end, text show ops) should be pushed/popped.
*** DONE Move parsing parameters to the Pdf class. Settable via pdf-extract.

** Tasks, up to 3 hours
*** DONE Handle new line operators, and all show text operators.
*** DONE Handle font metrics correctly, including glyph widths, displacement
    vectors and bounding boxes.
*** TODO Handle text matrix when it is applying a rotation.
*** TODO Handle type 3 font font matrices.
*** TODO Handle writing mode selection for composite fonts (type 0)
    (different font metrics). 
*** DONE Some way of splitting SpatialObjects by page.
*** TODO !! Handle type 3 font operators. These may not be supported by 
    pdf-reader!
*** DONE Add spatials parser.post { }, use in text_runs to sort and merge
    adjacent runs. Or split text_runs into characters and text_runs.
*** TODO Implement json output.
*** DONE For some PDFs, character width and height not detected correctly.
*** DONE In some PDFs, ascent, descent and bbox info for fonts is not
    available. Seems to be those fonts whose base font is one of the
    base 14.
*** DONE Prawn doesn't render over some PDFs.
*** DONE Assign colour, font, font size to character objects. Pass on to
    text chunks and regions.
*** DONE Characters appear too wide in some3.pdf test PDF.
*** DONE Characters on pages with images are sometimes not detected. Graphics
    state issue?
*** DONE When --margins and --zones specified duplicate margins appear
    in output.
*** DONE Pass chunk locations through to resolved references.

** Long tasks, greater than 3 hours
*** DONE Examine text_runs spatial definition and determine processing that
    is generic. Move into Parser methods. E.g. Handling global /
    object-specific state.
*** TODO Rewrite pdf.rb.
*** DONE Better organise pre/object/post call storage in pdf.rb . Perhaps
    a pre and post per object type.

** To version 0.1
*** DONE Join regions into sections only when their textual attributes match,
    such as letter ratio.
*** DONE Allow skipping when joining regions, or try to join vertically, then
    horizontally. Should allow for merging of disparate regions such
    as at the end of an article and beginning of another.
*** DONE Bug: First line sometimes not appearing in lines or --no-lines content.
    Probably region construction is creating regions with line and
    non-line content.
*** DONE Bug: Some section headers being merged into their body as a single region.
*** DONE Either move pdf-reader changes into pdf-extract or get patches committed.
*** DONE Split by line spacing and split by margin
*** DONE Bug: Section objects appear within <page> elements. Should be pageless.
*** DONE Bug: When merging chunks left to right, sometimes they merge out of order.
    Could be occuring in chunk generation or in region generation.
*** DONE Bug: Regions appear in reverse y sort order in output. Likely causing
    problems with section header analysis.

*** DONE Catalog system, download OAI-PMH metadata and PDFs
*** DONE Apply name service data to section detection
*** DONE Check for sequential delimiters first
*** DONE Partition refs on delimiter type frequency
    e.g. for x_offset (margin) delimiters, partition on the second
    most frequent x_offset.
*** DONE Sections still get split by one-liner regions
    Such as refs section of one-column.pdf
    Those one-liners should really get merged into regions, they
    are often part of a line.

    No longer an issue due to ignoring regions that are less than
    almost column width when joining sections.
*** DONE Headers joining onto section bodies. Thus appear as refs!
    Was due to not ignoring one-liners that were far less than the
    column width. Though will still have an issue with multi-line
    section headers.

* Problems
** How do I determine the correct reference parsing scheme?
*** DONE How do I distingush between junk references and real references?

** Reference section detection does not always work, and may misidentify
   non-ref sections as reference sections.
*** DONE Proper name ratio
*** DONE Punctuation ratio
*** DONE Capitalised words ratio
*** DONE Year literals ratio
*** DONE Are all of these above average for the content as a whole?
