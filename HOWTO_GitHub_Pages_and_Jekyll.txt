# How to setup "Github Pages" with "Jekyll".

(1) Install bundler:
        $ gem install bundler
(1) Create a new branch gh-pages (this is a special-purpose branch where Github
    is looking for website files:
        $ git checkout -b gh-pages
(2) Make sure, that there are no files in the branch. If you have created a
    branch from master, delete all included files:
        $ rm -rf *
(3) Create a file "Gemfile" with following content and save it to the root
    directory of the branch:
        source 'https://rubygems.org'
        gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins
(4) Install Jekyll and other dependencies from the GitHub Pages gem:
        $ bundle install
(5) Create a new Jekyll template site directory:
        $ jekyll new <folder_name>
        $ cd <folder_name>
(6) Edit the Gemfile. Comment the line
        gem "jekyll", "3.4.1"
    and uncomment the line
        gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
    in order to use GitHub Pages.
(7) Actually, the template site directory should contain folders like _layouts,
    _includes and _sass, but probably does not. The reason is that since 
    Jekyll 3.2 stores these folders in the theme-gem folder. But because GitHub
    needs these folders, copy the folders from there.
    Type 
        $ bundle show minima
    to get the location <PATH> of the folders.
    Copy all the included folders and files to the *root directory*:
        $ cd ..
        $ cp -R <PATH>/* .
(8) Push all the files to your GitHub repository:
        $ git add .
        $ git commit
        $ git push origin gh-pages
(9) Go to repository in GitHub and enable GitHub Pages:
        Click "Settings".
        Under GitHub Pages -> Source, choose "gh-pages branch"
        Click Save.
    Your website is now available under
        http://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/<folder_name>/
