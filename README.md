# arXiv Benchmark

This is the source code that was used to generate a benchmark that consists of 
more than X groundtruth files describing the basic internal document layouts of 
scientific research papers. The benchmark was created from tex files provided 
by the online repository [_arXiv_](http://arxiv.org/).
